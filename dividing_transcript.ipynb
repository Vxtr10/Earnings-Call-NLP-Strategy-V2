First, as we think about your move to consumption-based pricing and we also think about some of the changes in the sizes of the buckets for data, can you give us a sense of what's happening as you increase the data buckets, you try to encourage customers to spend more on data? Are you getting more in data revenue relative to those that might have started at a higher plan and can use the same amount, but moved to a cheaper bucket? Then the second question is if you just had an update on the regulatory process with the DIRECTV deal. I think the FCC put out an update on their clock today, and I am just curious if you could talk about the implications of that and any update from your perspective. Thanks\n",

       " 'Jack Vander: Okay. Great. Jack Vander here speaking from analysts from Maxim Group. How are you doing today Appreciate the update. I will throw the question for Brett. Actually, a quick housekeeping question. Just a quick one. What do you guys expect to release the full financial statements in the 10Q',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Probably very soon within an hour, I guess. We might have to wait. We might be required to wait till close the market. Today regardless .',\n",
       " 'Jack Vander: Yes. No worries there. Appreciate it there. Okay. Then Brent, maybe as for the revenue guide, it looks like we are now expecting sequential growth in the third quarter and then sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Just any additional color you can provide there on the topline and then maybe any additional thoughts an overall revenue potential for 2023',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Okay. So what we see and I think probably you have seen it reported out in other, since lasted to report out in other earnings calls. But we do see that the consume we saw in our own internal tracking through the WiSA association that consumer shifted a demand shifted at the end of April. So we think that has been followed up in orders coming in from our partners as well as reported out in Ph case. So we are just being more conservative until we see that demand come back. We get the consumer desire being consumers, ourselves that get the hell out of the house. But we think that turns around back in the fall. So we see sequentially growing revenue. We are just not forecasting yet how that impacts the fullyear. For 2023 What is that',\n",
       " 'Jack Vander: Understood there. And now move on to 3023 then.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: So 2023, we are expecting a strong year between DS coming in, WiSA E coming in, WiSA E rolled into speakers, probably knocks a hundred dollars off of MSRP. So in the world of inflation, consumer buying a hundred dollars is everything. Every hundred dollars is higher conversions and sell through. So we think 2023 is up against this year up against last year. Whatever reference point you want to use. And we think the feedback we have gotten out of those first 12 companies that, and a couple of them are really grinding WiSA DS. It has been extremely positive, in their words, shockingly strong performance for a 2.4 GHz solution. So we think as that rolls into next year in 2024, that is a strong revenue driver.',\n",
       " 'Jack Vander: Great. And then, yes, actually just to that point, just for clarity. So WiSA DS will be shipping. This is shipping this year when exactly. And then WiSA E is there a specific timeline for that during 2023, when that is going to shipped, is it the end of the year Is there a particular quarter',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Yes, so I misspoke on WiSA E in my presentation, we will actually start sampling WiSA E in Q4 this year, so there is four or five beta customers that we are talking to and we will select four or five of them, depending on our bandwidth to work with them, to test evaluate, and just like we did with DS. So that wont generate revenue, but just in terms of technology and shippable maturity, we expect to have those four or five beta customers with modules, with WiSA E to test and bang up in Q4. WiSA DS that will we will have two companies Well, we have two companies that are planning to go into production, which means we are shipping during Q4.',\n",
       " 'Jack Vander: That would be an official launch. That would be a commercial ready product in the fourth quarter with those two customers for WiSA DS',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Yes.',\n",
       " 'Jack Vander: Okay, great. And then, lets see. How about your because Im waiting for the balance sheet. Im not sure maybe I missed it, but can you provide an update on your inventory levels currently And then how you expect your inventory levels to move going into two the back after this year And then just anything or you have heard or any update with your customers, with their end inventory situation',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Yes. George, you want to take the inventory piece',\n",
       " 'George Oliva: Our second quarter inventory was relatively flat from Q1, but Q1, we saw an increase. As our customers have rescheduled orders out, we are also having to reschedule our vendors out. So, to the extent that we can defer the excess purchases to next year. We should start to see our inventory come down in the second half of the year. We dont really have a lot of visibility of our customers inventory. I dont know Brett, you can talk to that.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: We do not. So, but we do, we are in the channel. I will say the feedback coming from the retailer side of the channel is that there is going to be healthy promotions and discounting in the fall around consumer electronics. So that leaves us to believe that as demand shift, that our customers have been chasing product, cause of all the part shortages and logistics challenge, we still see part shortage issues impacting our customers. Logistic challenges of getting stuff out of manufactured in Asia into North America or Europe seem to have abated largely, but we now have customers that are putting out large POs to try to circumvent part shortages. And now as consumer demand has shifted somewhat, at least temporarily for these four or five months, we think that builds a promotional opportunity for good discounts for consumers in the fall.',\n",
       " 'Jack Vander: Okay. Helpful color there. Well guys, I appreciate the update. Thank you, George. Thank you, Brett.',\n",
       " 'George Oliva: And just to confirm your question about the queue, the queue will be filed at the close of market.',\n",
       " 'Jack Vander: Excellent. Thank you very much, George.',\n",
       " 'David Barnard: Okay. Moving on, lets go to, it is caller number ending in 3186. I think that is Kevin, do you want to unmute your line, dial star six.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Hi Brett. Hi George. Can you hear me okay. Kevin Dede here, H.C. Wainwright.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Yes. Good morning, Kevin.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Thanks for having me on the call and thanks for the help with handling the call. Alright, so you touched on this a little bit, Brett. You touched on an abatement in source. I was hoping you could sort of add a little more color on that, I guess a little more curious about the environment in China, given the pretty testy COVID restrictions. It doesnt seem to me that you are seeing a manufacturing issue. I just wanted to confirm that.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Well, so in terms of COVID and China it is nasty, where it impacts us most is being able to send, you know, senior executives from here to there to, you know, really show the vision of the product lines. So we have to depend on people in country. We cant get in or out of China. We from a part shortage, we know there is still sporadic part shortages. So that is impacting some of our customers. And there is no question, but logistically, you know, once stuff gets built is flowing.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Great. Yes. So that is kind of where I was going. I mean, things are getting built and you see that people are able to meet orders, at least your customers see that trend, I guess strengthening which seemed to be an issue earlier in the year.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Yes. We think now whether it is because people are pushing, I mean, we have seen customers push out orders, you know, we think it is around consumer demand, so pushed out orders frees up inventory right. So we dont, we do know from, we have an ODM in China on our Board. So we do know there is still part shortages in the space, but I would say the industry has probably gone 75 to 80, back to normal.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Okay. Good to hear. So you remarked in during your presentation that brands, I guess a limited return on increased performance and I guess pixel count on large screen TVs. Right. And so you mentioned that you think they are going to try to exploit the, you know, the sound experience as an avenue to boost margin and correct. Im just wondering like, yes. Im just wondering how much real evidence do you have of that',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Well, there is two brands that have been doing it, for a couple years. One is Visio and one is Samsung. So if you look at their product lines and they are merchandising at retail, they are heavily I want to say I dont want to say integrated as and they work flawlessly. But they are heavily merchandised together, number one. Number two, we have seen through the WiSA association a number of retailers that do very well with bundles. Now you can bundle a soundbar or you can bundle enclave or plat. So again, if the retailers are seeing it, the brands will see it. And then if you take one step further back in the cycle, here we are launching WiSA DS out of the 12 companies that are actively digging into it, eight of them are looking at it for soundbars.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Okay. So does that mean the soundbar comes with the television like, 3D packaged with the TV, or is it an merchandising at point of sale',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: But the important nuance is that, it will the TV, you will find it and turn it on with a little consumer issue. So that is our play, right. So why would you integrate WiSA DS into your TV I mean, this is what BOs has been doing with us for 10years. There is a WiSA module inside every one of their TVs. It finds every WiSA speaker in that room. So our position, which we think resonates is that, having wireless integration in the TV to with this interoperable speaker standard creates an opportunity for the TV brand to link their TV and their audio to one sale.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Okay. But the audio doesnt have to be of their brand.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: It does not.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Right. That is the beauty of it. Okay.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Right.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: You talked about some .',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Go ahead.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: No. Im sorry. I interrupted.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: No. I was just going to say that is the beauty of it. Merchandising wise from pick any brands, Skyworth or LG. Merchandising, they are going to merchandise their audio with their TVs. But having interoperability less consumer flexibility exactly. Isnt that everybody wants you know, a 1,000 audio system around their TV. Someone 20,000 around their TV like a BO situation.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Okay. You mentioned Amazon as your first retail location, and I know there was one other sort of name brand. Can you just talk about I mean, you did that you would expect .',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: For stores.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Yes for stores, right yes, you mentioned that three to five more coming online. I was just kind of hoping you could spend on that and in conjunction, maybe talk about your confidence in the marketing spend, as you believe consumers will come back to the home experience.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Great. So right now, the stores are Amazon Beach, Electronic Express, Waltz. There is one or two that elude me right now.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: There was one that began with an R if I remember correctly. Im sorry Brett keep going.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Focus, Beach, waltz, Electronic Express and Amazon. That would be six. And then there is a handful, so we think three to five will make it by year end that have expressed their desire. Some are selling platin speakers or will and some are just merchandising WiSA. So you had hi certified for being SoundSend and compatible. There will be we hope other brands. We expect other brands to certify that. So that builds a bigger base at retail and more importance to have a storefront that aggregates all the WiSA products in one place for a consumer. So why do I think consumer demand comes back I dont think consumers going back into a COVID case, hopefully none of us want to be there. But you are under incredible price pressure with inflation. If you just think about the mentality of the consumer. You got your trips in, but you are going to come back and have to figure out how to make the family budget in the fall. And I think if you have good promotions trying to align production, inventory and demand around this, there will be a surge of consumer buying. From an audio side, TVs have done really well up until Q2. So there is a lot of TVs without audio around it. But the psychology, the consumer, I think, is still get out the house at the moment. And yes, look, do we spend more or less on marketing It will depend on the results we see. I mean, we literally track it every single day.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Right. Can you speak to the results that you are seeing on Amazon I mean, I noticed that your WiSA Wave figures look like they fell off considerably from the March of the June quarter .',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: We took the spend down. Im sorry in Q2. We took the marketing expense down in Q2. We saw a drop right after April. So when we looked at the May results, the consumer spend pattern changed. Now that is when we look at consumers coming into WiSA, where do they go afterwards What is a conversion into a platin sale, which is super small But that is our metric. And it changed quite a bit. So it doesnt do us any good to drive consumers into the WiSA ecosystem to buy whatever product, whether it is LGTV or an enclave, if you know, they are not ready to buy. So, we dropped the fullyear guidance. We dropped spending down on our plan in Q2 and Q3. And we have most of the money shifted to September through December. After kids go back to school after summer vacation with the start of football fall, the cold and hopefully no virus.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Right. Just monkeypox. The other question kind of comes up Brett on manufacturing then do you see the WiSA connected customers able to meet demand Again, I apologize. You are just kind of going back to manufacturing as you see it in China.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Well, that is going to be SKU specific, ball parking, but I would say 80 of the SKU can meet demand now. There is certainly no reason they couldnt meet demand from our side and never have been. But there still are part shortages that are out there, but the complexity of the problem has dropped quite a bit.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Could you just sort of walk me through the timeline then in order to meet demand in the September, December timeframe products got to be in manufacturing now or soon',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Correct. Has to be in manufacturing, late this October. If logistics are running well, which they currently are in other both time into a Harbor and into a port and out of the port. You have to be producing Q3 latest October. We have visibility of our Pos in Q3, therefore, right. Should they get rescheduled because of demand further down the pipe. We dont have that visibility. We have visibility now to what our customers think they want to do now because they got to build now.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Dede: Right. Okay. Yes, no, thanks for taking me through that and answering the other questions, Brett, really appreciate it.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Yes. Thanks Kevin.',\n",
       " 'David Barnard: Great. We have a couple more questions queued up. Why dont we go to it is a caller with ending in 6291. If you could unmute your line dialing star six, could we unmute, there we go, please go ahead.',\n",
       " 'Unidentified Analyst: Well good morning, you guys, I have a few questions for you, Brett. So my first question is why did you do this type of financing that you announced today. Convertible security I dont understand that. Can you explain to us why you did that',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: Yes, so in general we have said our preference through financing is through strategic partnerships or using the ATM. We wanted to make sure our balance sheet was strengthened for the year end, but we didnt want the dilution of, you know, an S1 at the moment at these prices. So by we wanted to let all this investment we made in the last 12months, in the next six months roll into the market assuming that gives us a better opportunity for strategic partnerships and gives us a better opportunity to finance the effort at better stock prices. So this structure allowed us to secure, strengthen the balance sheet for the year end and pay it off with the future money if we need to or pay it off monthly using an ATM next year. I mean, we have sixmonths to start making payments. And you know, when you look at it, it is with our largest shareholder. So we think it is a supportive transaction to the strategy.',\n",
       " 'Unidentified Analyst: Okay. My next question is, I can under listen, I think your share price seems to be suffering. It is been suffering for a while. I cant understand, Im a buyer of this stock. I think it is very cheap. I cant understand. And we have spoken about this before. Why havent officers and directors purchased stock at this price I dont get it.',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: So that is a good question. the simple answer is officers and directors are right now in a quiet period and they have been for an extended period of time. And that will extend beyond the release of these financials. So they are not allowed to buy or sell at the moment, they are locked down.',\n",
       " 'Unidentified Analyst: Can we expect some support once you release these numbers',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: No, that is what Im saying. Ph, the directors and the Board is in an extended quiet period, right now.',\n",

       " 'Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That is great. My last question to you guys, Brett, can you explain to me, Im a little confused about the announcement about the NVIDIA association. Can you go into some detail as to what that is all about and what does the future look like for the company with NVIDIA, if at all',\n",
       " 'Brett Moyer: So NVIDIA joined WiSA, which is always a great sign when technology leader joins WiSA, strengthens the overall organization. We would not like, there is a number of members in WiSA that have not launched products. So and we dont preannounce anybodys product. So it could be they are tracking us, because for some reason, we may not even know, could be they are working on a or they are working on a product. But we cant discuss anybodys products just like we cant discuss who the three TV brands are that are digging into DS WiSA and DS to possibly integrate into the TVs. And some of them are members of WiSA, some of them are not. But what we talk about is WiSA organization and memberships, retail consumer tracking, but we never talk about somebody elses product or product plans, before they are announced by the company.',\n",

       " 'Gayn Erickson: Well, thats a good question. I actually dont have that in front of me. Im looking Im kind of mentally imagining the list that Vernon has and its a pretty long list. Im kind of guessing here, but a dozen or more it kind of range, Id say.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Yeah.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Couple I mean, a couple of questions in there. I mean, the traditional model is people usually take like one system and they will, I call it, sit on it and work through some issues or just make sure it gets called into production, then theyll order another one and you go through lead times and then start shipping it. I would say, thats not what the shape looks like with these customers. Its more of full systems, maybe multiple systems in a short period of time and some cases in multiple facilities and its kind of go, go, go. So, now, the other customer has our lead customer has been making some really significant investments. They to some extent led the industry in this waferlevel burnin portion. Its certainly been felt in the industry, everybodys quite aware of it and they took a pretty long time to absorb the first one and then started ramping pretty hard. My guess is, is that, its softer during the first six months to 12 months and then it gets stronger thereafter. Well see it. It depends on the customer. Even its kind of interesting, I mean, even with test times, Ive had been engaged with customers and theyll tell me their test time is such and such over and over and over again. And then they go to place the order and then they told me the real test times and they are longer than they were. Why is that Is it just theyre trying to be coy or not tell you everything So were right now when things happen is were definitely trying to ferret out long, lead and forecasts for multiple customers, as we just stated, to just make sure we have plenty of material on that is being purchased. But I think they will start a little slower and then gradually pick up. And as we had if you look at the amount of capacity that everybodys talking about to hit in 2025 calendar wise, most people are just really focused on second half 2023 and into 2024 is where just a lot of capacity is coming online and so it may be less to do with the timing of us as the timing of that silicon carbide ramp. And our goal is to get qualified before that ramp happens and have a ton of capacity and material on hand to be able to address it.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Yeah. I mean, its broken up of maybe a few things. One is that seemingly what most people think is the obvious, which is if you come look at our facility, and you say, well, how many tools can you build on the floor here. But in reality thats some ways the easiest thing. The testers basically boltin to water and power and they test themselves. And we have a pretty good sized facility here with enough test based to build significantly. Ken alluded to that. Were actually going to be doing some investments probably couple few million dollars into the facility over the next couple of years, putting in additional power, water drops and some other enhancements to support our WaferPak business as well. But that would allow us to have maybe 10 plus drops, meaning we can be billing 10 systems at a time on two weeks spreads. I mean, thats a lot of capacity, more than the whole industry would take right now. We were building 20 systems a month for example. The next one is the subcontractors that are building all those subassemblies that come to us and then I have to go down the list of them. But basically, we have multiple chambers suppliers, multiple blade suppliers, multiple printed circuit board suppliers. And generally speaking, even as grandiose as we are excited, we dont really press that. And the key here is weve been able to do this without really being impacted by everybodys whining about supply chain, outside of one thing and thats the last one and that is the semiconductor components. Semiconductor components we have a really, really good handle on. We know exactly how many that go in the system, were forecasting and were buying semiconductor components right now 12 month and 18 months out, and have been for 18 months. And because of the, quite frankly, massive leverage on semiconductor components to our revenue, were able to afford to buy a lot of semiconductors ahead of time. So were just not really being caught. Now having said that, we still have our onesie, twosie along the way and hiccups, and the guys are working their butts off to just make sure it looks like its easy. But for the most part, weve just not been impacted and allow us to keep both our lead times down and our capacity up. But could we go ship 100 million, 200 million, 300 million worth of FOXXP systems in a year, absolutely.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Well, not as much as it was last year as a percentage. So thats a good sign. And some of the upside within that range and some of the upside beyond that range include them. And just not always having all the perfect visibility we have, obviously, we know a lot more about sharing, but theyre going through all kinds of different manufacturing plans scenarios where theyre going to be putting systems more facilities. And we dont even with our current installed base customer, we dont have perfect visibility. So partly we just buy enough material, because we can anticipate the amount of market share that were going to have. But we definitely have within that number several new customers and not just engineering, but product first production systems being installed. And the part of the front end of that, too, is how many will we get installed in time, will we have any kind of rev rec things with respect to being right on the edge with their acceptance, that creates some of the sort of uncertainty. Guys, if we didnt have to do quarters or years, you hear from CEOs all the time, my life would be a lot easier. The reality is, if I just look in the next year or I look out to next December and you look at what that ramp looks like, Im way more focused on that. But I get it, weve got straight expectations to meet and we want to make our shareholders happy too. I just think exactly timing everything within a quarter. Sometimes its harder. And thats where you see that kind of wiggle room of the 60 million to at least 60 million to 70 million and we and then make statements like and we have capacity to do beyond that, okay.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Yeah. I am not going to go there, Christian. Sorry, we spent a lot of time making sure that Im thats the one thing we do discuss as a Board pretty hard to make sure. I apologize for that. But I will tell you, Im very confident and Ill go ahead and its not a big stretch out there. We definitely believe that will grow next year over this year. Let me leave it at that.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Okay. Nice try though, Christian. All good.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: So obviously we have insight under nondisclosures and given the fact that I said Im talking to all of them major suppliers, you can imply Im talking to every one of the big guys, including the ones you mentioned and then some under nondisclosures. And that gives me in many ways way more visibility than others, but primarily related to the devices. There exactly what they know nonpublic related to their substrates. I dont have as much visibility and I wouldnt really share. Its my belief that all of the major suppliers are all having success and counting on success of developing their own substrate supply chain, and obviously, that includes the big guys. Wolfspeed, of course is, has been, was the major supplier of it, theyre obviously expected to be very successful making devices out of that. ST, with their announcement of their new fab or their manufacturing facility is absolutely counting on ramping their own. And obviously, on Semiconductor is another one along those lines in the course, Infineon has got some more going on, too. Its my belief that all of them will be successful. I dont Im not hearing anyone that can genuinely say, theres certainly people that are saying its not as easy as it looks. Its take some time, but theres a lot of money being put in. I mean, Wolfspeed spent 30 years working on this stuff and they their competitors are spending more money to make pools in this year that maybe Wolfspeed spent in their whole career or so. I dont know if thats fair, but it feels like that. So, theres a lot of energy to go try and solve this problem and my belief is theyll find, theyll figure it out.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Let me do it differently. Theres most of the vendors, most of the companies today have either little or zero waferlevel burnin with the exception of our lead customer. I actually happen to know by quantity how many wafers a capacity and it is a very small fraction comparatively. Keep in mind, one of my systems can test 18 wafers at a time. Weve publicly talked about our competitors. I choose really not to do it in this forum, because then they can read about it and its not because but the people that are out there test one way for at a time with a prober and it just doesnt scale. I mean, in the same footprint of, I actually use this analogy. I apologize if I did it on this group before. But our tester and the surrounding area that it takes to actually service it is about the size of like a small Prius car and it sits in a parking lot, like imagine that space, okay. Thats what our system is and in that stall Im looking at at our parking lot, in that room actually its smaller than that, but in that room, you can test 18 wafers. Thats about the same size as our competitors test one. If you go through the math and Ive done this before, if you realize that the world needs 8 million wafers in 2030, that was a Canaccord number and I round down using like 8700 hours a year with inefficiencies, et cetera. You need 1000 wafers an hour, okay, to meet that demand. So if you start looking at like a 10hour burnin time, you have 10,000 wafers of capacity, thats a 10,000 car parking lot by my competitor. Now were 18 times smaller. Its were not zero footprint. But in the cost of it of a manufacturing floor of a wafer fab, thats enormous. And so if youre a player playing in a market thats going to need 10,000 wafers of capacity of testers and you want to have 20 market share and you need 2000 wafers a capacity. Where are you going to put that There is no test floor in the world that has 2000 wafers that it can support 2000 wafers wafer probers for silicon carbide. Theres no way. So were just obviously a very big opportunity.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Sure.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Yeah. I had were talking to now several. I had to go double check that, because weve been talking to these guys for not very long by the way. I mean, I wouldnt say its been four months that we went from zero to first order in four months with these guys. I had to go double check to make sure they havent publicly said anything when I wrote that, but they havent. And we theres another customer weve been working with that has never said anything public, either. But I did notice they showed up at one of the tradeshows recently, I still not going to talk any more about it. But we know they have massive plans, on the order of to some of the current top fours. Keep in mind, and this is always, Ive done this math before, its always interesting, if you just go through the simple math of these forecasts and say there was 125,000 wafer starts to do silicon carbide last year and theres 4 million, I think, if you remember, like, 25 times. Another way of thinking about it is that, all of the silicon carbide that was built last year, right, is not even what 2 or 2, what is that like, Im sorry, go ahead 25 year, 4 of the overall market, you get that. So all of the suppliers today dont even dent the market in eight years. So they all have to grow substantially. People need to grow a lot to just sustain a small percentage market share. So theyre going to need a lot more players. I mean, I sat in meetings where leaders like ST Microelectronics, who is the number one at a conference last May in San Diego, he stood up and said, listen, I just want to be very clear, we have no plans to build enough capacity to maintain a 50 market share like we did last year. They just dont. Theyre not going to spend that much. So by definition, theyre going to lose market share from being number one at 50. But theyre still planning to grow like a huge amount, but theyre not going to go 25x. So the world actually needs a lot more players.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Youre welcome.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Okay. So, Im not foolish to think that as the market is obviously large and growing, there wont be people trying to figure out how to get into it. We are in a particular unique scenario where the way we do our testing is truly unique. Perhaps you could say, it could be in a negative connotation. If you look at every way for tester in the world, Ive been in this industry for 35 years. I built them for most of that. The way you build an ATE system to test semiconductors is all the same. Every one of the companies, all 20 of them in the last 20 years have done it the same way. You build a tester box that sits on one of the three main wafer prober companies probers, it docks to one of 20 probe card suppliers and the three different industries, the tester, the prober and the probe card supplier have effectively have multiple people competing for the same capability and then people buy those tools, integrated themselves and put them on their floor. And that is a very successful business. Its combined its a big chunk of the 13 billion semiconductor automated test business last year. The problem with that is that those test times are all designed around seconds of test time. And so that test style might be an average somewhere between 1 million and 2 million to test the wafer. If you just look at the capital depreciation, testing one or two or four, eight devices at a time, its extremely expensive to do it, but the test times are so low, its okay. Now you take that exact same test time. And by the way, thats how you test silicon carbide at wafer level today. Functional test of a silicon carbide device takes about 2.5 seconds. And most of the testers that are in production today are between one and eight devices at a time. Its really cheap and easy to do that. When you go to burn them in, they now take 12 hours. Well, how are you going to do that with a tester that take in only test eight at the time, you just cant do that. We built a machine aimed at a completely different market, which is the idea that were going to take package part burnin level costs and parallelism and implement that at wafer level and we made investments over the last decade to do that, quite frankly looking at macroeconomic trends of heterogeneous integration of semiconductors, of automotive devices going in this direction, of multidie that modules going in this direction. Do not kid yourself, we did not think silicon carbide eight years ago was going to be this great hot market or that the world would actually be contemplating that were all going to be driving electric vehicles in 20 years, okay. But what we did do is anticipate the market trends that were headed in this direction, and quite frankly, were sitting out in front of this when the silicon carbide hit us sideways. And were just we just have we call it what it is, we call the shock that it was heading this direction and we were ready and prepared to take advantage of the wave and its it really exciting. It is not that easy to do what we do and we have an entire list of patents to defend it and we will defend that with any company that tries to build a test or like ours or any customer that tries to use a tester built by someone else that looks like ours. In the meantime, we have a long head start and were our goal is to get engaged with as many of these customers as we can. Also, were working directly with some of the automotive suppliers now, who now would look to qualify the tool and then they could qualify it backwards into multiple vendors. So that once were qualified, I dont think anyones going to want to switch anyhow. I know Im pretty been specific about our strategy, but thats how its playing out right now. So, having said that, were also running like hell, were absolutely making sure that we do not limit anyone in capacity of testers. We have the shortest lead times of any tester company Ive heard of. I mean, I took an order like two weeks ago and shipped at the end of the week. Ill take an order. Im ready to talk about what my next orders are. But Im going to be announcing some orders that are going to ship within a quarter, okay. We have that ability and we can tell the customer we can meet their capacity demands that theyre imagining out 12 months and six months and 18 months, right, 12 years, 18 years and two years, sorry. So the next thing is this, technically, there are some things and its not so much a weakness as it is people would like to do more testing or be able to do. So we took our power supplies that were going at about 30 volts and we increase them to 40 volts. Were not trying to make sure theres no technical reason you need to go away from us. So now we have the ability to give you a technical solution for engineering characterization of high voltage, high gates, all the different threshold voltages and stuff that you do for qualification and then move that into high volume production, either in the same configuration or in cost optimized configuration that we dont really get to on these calls, but we have some tricks up our sleeve to actually do characterization with higher cost performing systems and then go to a production volume one that hits a price point that is very novel. And so were trying to hit it on all of these, technically, commercially capacity to be able to address it and then we have IP patents to protect ourselves and then were just paranoid and running as fast as we can.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Thank you, Greg. Its nice talking to you.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Im good, sir. In a particularly good mood these days.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: All right. I really appreciate that. Real quickly, it does seem on the outset that youre having shorter lead times, because of how well a customer wanted to see and when they got it and they messed around for a while. Am I interpreting that correct that the mass adoption or that your system really does work that well. But whats changed now, are they more in the workforce that suddenly sounds like the sales lead time is a little quicker unless Im misinterpreting that',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Yeah. I think I got it. You broke up a little. So I apologize if I think I got the gist of it. So let me kind of repeat it back a little bit. So this idea that, it seems like things are going a little faster, maybe the sales cycles a little shorter, et cetera. Theres thats absolutely the case and I think theres a few things going on there. This really is one where COVID being over helps, okay. I mean, just things were so slow with current and new customers and people werent traveling and its just hard to sell and its hard to communicate. You can only do so much over tune. So thats definitely one of them. Theres also this element that, if you three years ago, right, we were selling these systems, people know the lead customers of this platform were Apple and Intel and ST Microelectronics and some of these, because they were 10 customers for us, right But theyre still kind of',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: is it real, does it really make sense, its kind of niche, these are weird products, whatever it is, right Its like, Im not sure. Then all of a sudden as people know that one of the big silicon carbide customers came along and bought this, and quite frankly, bought one system and sat on it for more than a year, of course, code was going on. So theres still sort of this, is it real, is it really going to work, does that whole thing. Then all sudden, they start ramping, then all of a sudden, from what it feels like and Ive heard this directly, they companies that theyre selling to are kind of coming back, because they really have done a good job of marketing themselves has being quality differentiated, selling the modules, selling the quality of the modules, and quite frankly, they did presentations, I talked about their waferlevel burnin earlier and I think its come through. So then theyre winning deals and those customers, their customers are turning around and talking to now their competitors and saying, oh, do you have waferlevel burnin Theres no doubt some of thats going on, okay. And were doing everything we can do to foster that environment, okay. Because all we have to do is get somebody say, I want to do waferlevel burnin and right now, we win. Were done, because our value proposition, our solution, our lead times, our price points, theyre a slam dunk. And so right now its like, were not taking advantage of this. Were not raising up. We did not raise our prices, guys, okay. Did not do it. We had some things where our cost went up. I mean, I did pay 50,000 to ship a chamber and last Christmas, it was crazy. But I didnt pass that on to my customer. Im not doing that game. And I we make good money. Were going to make a lot of it. Were going to provide a value to our customers and were going to be there for them. And I think that were in this in good position because of that.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: No. We provide we really only provide guidance annually and we only do it once a year, rather we have kind of fallen into the we reiterate or in some cases weve uptick.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: So we provided that guidance. And I get it, people said, what does that mean at least 60 million or 70 million Is it 60 million and is it 70 million. What and we were not intentionally trying to be acute, but that still feels about right I mean, we think were in good shape for that and it just really depends on some of the timing of these customers ramps. So sometimes I dont feed anyone questions, but Im going to feed you a question that is, were you able to ship everything your customers wanted last quarter Yes. So why was it only 10 whatever Thats all they wanted I mean, thats the reality of it. And you think youre going to grow Why Because the customers want more and I can build more. Its like its sort of like that we were actually ahead of the game on this. And so now were getting into why is it that there was it seems softer than Q4 and I know some of those reasons. So very private about customers ramps and their design wins and when they wanted WaferPaks and I got facility issues with people that are talking about bringing on new facilities and some of that stuff just hard to handicap and know what the answer is. And so and of course, I have to guess correctly with these guys. And some of this is, Im pretty confident in winning these customers, but itll be itll feel good when they give us the first POS, too, right So',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: its hard to guide that way. But, yeah, we did not change our guidance, if you will. I guess, we said, were very confident of that number. And as our backlog builds up and if the backlog and the customers asked for more than that, we will guide up at that time or as it makes sense, but again, were not trying to play that game.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Okay.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Okay. Awesome. Itd be good to go back. I love the travel personally, so.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Okay. Thank you.',\n",

       " 'Gayn Erickson: Yeah. Let me try and answer as clear as I...',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Go ahead.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: I am glad you asked it that way. Thatll be easier for me to answer.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Because its Im not trying to be coy here, okay. But let me try. Let me try and guess. So there are several ways, not 10, theres primarily two main ways that you can stress these MOSFET devices to weed out infant mortality, okay. A MOSFET is a transistor. A transistor, if you imagine a water valve, like on your sink is a great analogy. All you do is a transistor allows electrical current or water to flow through it, when you turn on the valve, or in this case, apply a voltage to the gate. Thats it. You apply a voltage, water flows through it, you turn off the gate, the water stops flowing through it. If the device works properly, when you turn it off, it doesnt drip. Recall that leakage. If you put a big power pressure behind it, it might leak a little and they actually specify how much it leaks. But if it leaks more than that, its bad, okay. Now, there are two main stresses you can do to verify that. One of them is, is a gate bias, a high voltage gate bias on the gate itself. Imagine the valve Im describing, I want you to put your hand on the valve and I want you to turn it over as hard as you can, try and break it on, okay. Sounds kind of odd, but thats exactly what we do. We basically overstressed the gate, and if the gate breaks, it snaps off. We actually call that a glass rod snap inhouse. It we love showing those to customers, particularly when they take 24 hours or 48 hours to show up, okay. That is a failure that shows up. It is the primary failure in silicon carbide MOSFETs that everybody talks about and you have to get rid of those. Those show up in cars and you have what we call a walk home event, which is you get out of your car and you walk home when it dies, okay. So those need to be weeded out and thats what we do primarily, okay, because the gap, the gate oxide has defects in it in the manufacturing process, that Ill get into it, but theyre not going away, that if you if those flows through all the way to your end customer, thats bad, okay. So we apply a high voltage gate bias onto the gate to overstress it to try and crack it off and thats a primary way of doing it. Another test is called the reverse bias, which is imagine putting really high pressure on that valve, water pressure, its called voltage in this case and it shouldnt leak through. Now the difference between that test, thats a good quality test or a reliability test. Meaning you want to do that during your process to validate the devices do not fail and youll do that over, say, a 2000 hour, thats not necessarily a production test. The production test may only take a few seconds. But there are people that want to do qualification of that high voltage and theres some people that have done it in production and we have now provide them with a solution to do that, okay. Having said that, you cant do the same as the gate, you actually, if lets say the device is rated for 1200 volts, you dont apply 1800 volts to the device, it will kill it, it will weaken it and it will not be shippable. So you can only put 1200 volts on it. So its not really a burnin stress condition. Its a functional test validation and you might want to do it for a few seconds, but its not necessarily a production test. But what, if you want to put my system in production with that, you go for it, it costs a little bit more, Ill be happy to do it and Ill shop I will sell you FOXXPs forever. Our opinion and weve been fairly open about it is that you want to do characterization, you want to do that and you want to get that out of production as soon as you can and you should go to this gate bias testing and thats our story. And you we now have the tools to give you whatever you want to do. You can buy whatever you want, well be happy to sell it to you. It is more expensive to do reverse bias, but were cheaper than anybody else by a long way.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Okay. Now',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: I do. I do. I do.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: I think over time, thats really where the cost is going and thats weve been talking multiple. We by the way, the new BVCM, I know nobody cares about our language here. But the new bipolar voltage, it actually allows it to go a little higher voltage. We had some people that want to do that. Interestingly, as the devices mature, the voltage is actually going down. So were kind of feel like, but theres some people that ask for it, particularly in the gallium nitride and so were like, sure, no problem. We also have a negative voltage and theres some technical white papers out there that people are doing to do that as an accelerant and now we have, I think, the only solution out there to do that, even in packaged parts. So now we have the ability to do a negative voltage, which is something people may want to do too and well be happy to sell them those systems. It looks just like our current system. It just simply goes a larger voltage range, okay.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: No. Because I Im leaking my, that were taking orders, but I havent we havent even put it on the website yet. So I dont yet. But, actually, I do if youre under nondisclosure. But you have to qualify first as a silicon carbide buyer and you dont qualify. Im kidding. For everybodys watching. Larry always asked me about this thing. Well be talking about that in a little bit here, Larry. But, yeah, as Larry alludes to, we are selling as a turnkey solution with an integrated XP with the automated aligner attached to it. And well probably',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: make those announcements with those first production orders that we get from customers.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Yeah.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: Yeah. I mean, Im probably a little too familiar with that, because you got a little wrong. But generally, yes, the cycling test of a NAND flash memory and waferlevel is one as a is a potentially critically, its a good idea before you put it into enterprisebased solid state devices and there are people that are doing that today. And you are correct, our FOXXP system, when we first were talking to it, we were engaged in talking with some of the memory suppliers and our FOXXP system is capable of testing flash memory. So its kind of funny that a MOSFET is a single transistor and the tester is also capable of testing in full memory.',\n",
       " 'Gayn Erickson: As people know, one of the challenges we had at the time, we did not have automation and candidly, we were pretty small and we were on the drawing board with this solution, as opposed to now were shipping it in volume.
