"Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Valmont Industries Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Renee Campbell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications.
Renee Campbell: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Valmont Industries' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. With me on today's call are Steve Kaniewski, President and Chief Executive Officer; Avner Applbaum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Tim Francis, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. 
Stephen Kaniewski: Thank you, Renee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before reviewing our fourth quarter highlights, I want to acknowledge and thank our global team of over 10,000 associates for their noteworthy performance throughout this past year. I could not be more proud of their efforts as they work hard in the face of the pandemic to provide our customers with essential products and services, while prioritizing safety in our workplace and our communities.  Our team's dedication and focus has positioned us very well for success in the future. With that, let me turn to a brief recap of our fourth quarter, summarized on Slide 4 of the presentation.  Net sales of $798.4 million increased $115 million or 16.8% compared to last year due to significantly higher sales in the Irrigation and Utility Support Structure segments. Starting with Utility, sales of $271 million grew 16.9% year-over-year, led by significantly higher sales of global generation products as expected. Strong demand for renewable energy generation is increasing and Utilities continue to invest in a more resilient grid.  Moving to Engineered Support Structures. Sales of $256.1 million were similar to last year. Favorable pricing and currency impacts were offset by lower volumes, primarily due to lower international sales as COVID-19 impacts continued to affect end market demand, mostly in France and India. Sales of transportation products were higher in North American markets, driven by State's continued investments in road and construction projects. Wireless communication structures and components sales were similar to last year's record fourth quarter, led by continued strong demand and favorable pricing in all regions. 
Avner Applbaum: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9 and fourth quarter results, my comments will focus on the adjusted results as outlined in the press release and in the Reg G disclosure in the presentation appendix. Please also note that for comparison purposes, references to 2019 operating income and earnings per share exclude the LIFO method of accounting for inventory, which was discontinued at the beginning of fiscal 2020.  Fourth quarter operating income of $68.8 million or 8.6% of sales grew 180 basis points or 36% compared to last year, driven by improved operational efficiency in all segments, higher volumes in Utility and Irrigation and the nonrecurrence of last year's losses in the Access Systems product line. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $2.20 grew 46% compared to last year, driven by higher net earnings, a nonrecurrence of losses in the Access System Business and the more favorable tax rate.  Fourth quarter tax rate was 24.4% on an adjusted basis. This excludes a nonrecurring $1 million benefit or $0.05 per share from the adoption of U.S. tax regulation finalized in 2020, which allows for more favorable treatment of tax payments by our farm subsidiaries.  Turning to the segments. On Slide 10, in Utility Support Structures, operating income of $28 million or 10.3% of sales decreased 110 basis points compared to last year. While strong volumes and improved operational performance drove higher profits, quality of earnings was impacted by higher mix of offshore and other complex steel structures. 
Stephen Kaniewski: Thank you, Avner. Moving to Slide 19. As we have consistently stated over the past year, the fundamental market drivers of our business remain intact, and we are seeing a solid setup for 2021 across all end markets, as evidenced by our record $1.1 billion backlog at the end of the year.  In Utility, our strong year-end backlog of nearly $565 million remains at elevated levels and demonstrates the ongoing demand and necessity for renewable energy solutions and grid hardening. We are pleased to announce that in the first quarter, we were awarded the third purchase order of approximately $70 million for the large project in the Southeast U.S., confirming our customers' confidence in our execution, quality and value.  We are well positioned to be a preferred strategic partner with utilities and developers for their renewable energy goals. And the expanding ESG focus in the utility industry is providing us with market opportunities.  In Engineered Support Structures, we expect a solid year with some short-term market softness in transportation, as delays in last year's Fast Act renewal begin to flow through state budgets. We have been getting many questions about the impact of an infrastructure bill. If one is passed, this segment will experience upside growth approximately 9 to 12 months after enactment. The long-term market trends for both transportation and wireless communication structures and components remain solid, and the critical need for infrastructure investment provides very good economic stimulus for nations.  Given the record purchase price, of the recent 5G spectrum auction in the U.S., we expect growth in wireless communication structures and components to accelerate in 2021. Carriers' investments are increasingly supporting work and school at home. And macro build-outs in suburban and rural communities aligning with recent favorable trends in residential construction.  Our Coatings business closely follows industrial production trends and general economic activity. The drivers remain solid and the preservation of critical infrastructure and extending the life of steel fits well within our ESG principles.  And in Irrigation, recent improvements in net farm income have improved grower sentiment and tighter ending stocks have driven corn and soybean prices to 6- and 7-year highs. This improved demand, along with strength across international markets and the large-scale multiyear project in Egypt is providing a good line of sight for 2021, as evidenced by our year-end global backlog of $328 million, an increase of 5x the level from 1 year ago.  Our investments in technology remain a priority. And this past year, we expanded our Valley Insights Anomaly Detection Solution into more regions across North America. As we enter the third year of offering this innovative solution, I'm excited to share that the number of monitored acres more than doubled to 5 million in 2020, leading to twice as many growers using the service as compared to 2019. This critical milestone on the path to autonomous crop management is expected to double again in 2021, and we look forward to sharing more of this exciting journey with you later this year.  Turning to Slide 20. When analyzing the demand drivers across our business portfolio, one of the early findings of our ESG task force is how well our products and solutions align with ESG principles and themes. Altogether, I am very proud that approximately 90% of Valmont's net sales supports ESG efforts.  As the world continues to transition to a clean energy economy, approximately 90% of our utility support structure sales are tied to ESG, including 45% to renewable energy initiatives and 45% to grid resiliency and critical reliability efforts. Approximately 90% of Engineered Support Structure sales are also attributable to ESG.  Valmont's products improved traffic flow within roads and cities, while promoting public safety through our lighting solutions. Further, the need for a connected world is now as pressing as ever before. Whether it's expanding wireless connectivity to rural communities or strengthening the smart city of the future, our wireless communication products support these initiatives.  In Coatings, nearly 100% of our sales helps preserve and extend the life of metals up to 3x longer. Zinc and steel are both 100% recyclable and hot dip galvanizing is a proving corrosion protection system and has one of the lowest carbon footprints of any coatings application.  And in Irrigation, nearly all of our sales are tied to sustainability and conservation. A warming climate drives the need for more efficient use of freshwater and the need to produce more food for a growing global population using sustainable farming techniques, it is critical imperative and it is highly supported by our business.  In terms of our own sustainability efforts, I'm very pleased that at the end of 2020, we exceeded our global electricity conservation goal set in 2018, resulting in a 14% reduction in normalized electricity consumption, well ahead of our 8% goal.  As a further benefit, we also reduced our Scope 2 carbon footprint by approximately 10,000 metric tons in 2020, a notable accomplishment by our green teams. We recognize the increasing focus by many of our stakeholders on addressing ESG and climate change.  Next month, we will publish our annual sustainability report, highlighting the ESG benefits of our products and solutions, additional metrics, employee well-being and our goals and leadership in key ESG elements. We're excited to highlight our commitments throughout the organization, along with our plans to conserve resources and improve life in 2021 and beyond.  Turning to Slide 21. In summary, we are expecting solid operating performance and strong EPS accretion and are encouraged that sales growth is expected to exceed our stated long-term financial goal. We are focused on profitable growth and return on invested capital improvement, while keeping our employees and communities safe and investing in our business for growth.  Our strategic framework remains fully intact as we position Valmont for success now and in the future. Finally, we are excited to announce our plans to host a virtual Investor Day in May 2021, and we'll share more details in the coming weeks. As we prepare to celebrate our 75th anniversary as a company in March, I want to again recognize our 10,000 global employees. It is because of your dedication and hard work that we are able to exceed our commitments in 2020, and why I remain confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value and deliver on our expectations moving forward.  I will now turn the call back over to Renee.
Renee Campbell: Thank you, Steve. At this time, the operator will open up the call for questions.
Operator: . Our first question today is from Brian Drab of William Blair.
Brian Drab: I first just wanted to ask about operating margin and the guidance for 2021. You said that operating margin should be in the 9% to 10% range in the first quarter. And I'm just wondering if the assumption that, that improves in the second half of the year, which sounds like it does given the steel headwind, if that gets better as we move through the year, I'm just struggling a little bit with the reconciliation of the revenue, operating margin, EPS herewith -- I'm putting in my model right now midpoint of the range for revenue and 10% operating margin, and it's spitting out something north of -- a little bit north of at $10.  And I'm just wondering, is there -- how do you expect operating margin to trend throughout the year? And what might I be missing that putting in the mid -- kind of the midpoint of the range for revenue and modestly improving operating margin would give me something above your EPS range?
Avner Applbaum: Yes. This is Avner. Let me take that one. So right -- so first of all, yes, right, we are -- as we said, we are getting pinched during the first half of the year, and we are going to recover throughout the year with incremental gross profit.  When you do kind of look at your modeling, right, you're taking into consideration, right, that our growth, we have the 2% FX. And then we do have a -- the price component, but if you want to model, I'd say, between 2% to 4% of the growth is coming from pricing, and a lot of that will actually be passed through.  So we'll definitely take that into consideration, right? And some of the growth is coming from Egypt. And as we mentioned, in Irrigation, as we mentioned, that has more of the international type of margins, factor in some of the other growth that could come from areas like solar as well. So I think if you factor all that in, hopefully, that kind of helps you get there.
Stephen Kaniewski: And Brian, I'll just add that we don't know the extent to which when steel will actually abate. So we're taking a little bit of a conservative line around when steel will actually back off. Right now, futures of hot-rolled all the way through July are over 1,000. And so it will take some time for us to get some of the pricing through. But as Avner said, 2% FX, 2% to 4% really price recovery or cost recovery, leaving you with about, I think, 5% to 8% of ""volume growth.""
Brian Drab: So my follow-up then is and it will be a true follow because on the same topic is margin expected to be -- is operating margin expected to be somewhat better in the second half of the year at this point? And where do you expect -- where do you hope to exit the year in terms of operating margin?
Avner Applbaum: Yes. So I mean we will see improvement. I mean just bear in mind, kind of taking mind set kind of the seasonality that hits us in Q3, especially when you kind of look at the Irrigation business. So I would kind of take that into consideration as well.
Stephen Kaniewski: Yes, it will improve slightly as we go through the year. And again, irrigation has typically a softer third quarter because there's not really a lot of sales there, then recovering more in the fourth quarter.
Avner Applbaum: Right. Assuming moderation of steel in the second half part of the year.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Moore of CJS Securities.
Christopher Moore: So maybe just stay with the irrigation. So obviously, looking at very strong growth, close to 30% for the year. Just trying to get a feel on the North American irrigation side. Does that imply kind of high single-digit growth in North American irrigation, low double digit? Or how should I look at that?
Stephen Kaniewski: Yes. When you look at the growth, we're assuming about half comes from international and about half from domestic. So the domestic number would be higher than the single digits, more like 15%, 12% to 15% is what we've baked into our assumptions.
Christopher Moore: Got it. And just a quick question on the Access Systems. So in terms of the -- it could be a sale, it could be just kind of shutdown parts of the business. First...
Stephen Kaniewski: We would -- sorry, go ahead, Chris.
Christopher Moore: No, no. Yes.
Stephen Kaniewski: I was just going to say that the -- we will likely sell the business. We've already taken the actions to exit some of the less profitable product lines all throughout 2020. Again, the business will make money for the year. And so it's trending in a decent way. But it really just doesn't fit strategically. And so that's why we look for a buyer.  It's hard for us to grow outside of the regions that it's currently in as we speak or to gain leverage through the rest of the portfolio with it. So that's our reason to look to divest of that.
Christopher Moore: Got it. And is the sale of the business assumed at any point in your guidance for this year?
Stephen Kaniewski: No, not right now. So Access Systems is included in our full year guidance with not any sale. When that would come about, we would obviously do a separate release to discuss how that would impact us.
Operator: The next question is from Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones: Just like to ask about the USS business and the gross profit, gross margin headwinds there expected in the first half. It's my understanding in that business that a lot of the contracts you have there have escalated and deescalated for steel prices. So this must be coming out of the spot market.  Did we have a situation here where you took some fixed price orders in the spot market, steel ran -- I mean we all know still run very quickly in the second half of the year that's kind of left you with some price costs mismatches here that you have to work through in the first half before you can start running through more appropriately priced projects as we get into the second half?
Stephen Kaniewski: Yes, there was definitely some spot orders that are included into that. But also, even with our alliances, the steel move was so dramatic. If you take December alone, I think, on Slide 26, we have a graph there. December alone moved up 45%. And so even work that we would have adjustors, the adjustors can't operate that quickly. They're usually quarterly adjustors.  And therefore, even our physical hedges and financial hedges couldn't cover what was there. So that is the pinch that we're predicting around 220 basis points for the first half of the year. And then the cost indices will recalibrate themselves, and we've modeled that, and we've looked at it every which way that over the second half of the year, between that and some of the financial instruments that we've put in place, why we feel confident that gross margin dollars for the second half of the year will definitely increase to recover.
Nathan Jones: Okay. It would also seem to me that demand in that business is extremely strong at the moment, and there shouldn't really be an issue with having the market bear those price increases. And this is just a timing mismatch?
Stephen Kaniewski: That's right. It's -- the volume is very strong. Obviously, with some of the issues that are going on as we speak in Texas and other places, it just again furthers the need for the grid resiliency. And the renewables push will remain unabated. It's simply a matter of getting the cost recovery with the mechanisms that are in place.  Again, for reference, our products are only 10% of an overall project cost. So even if they've seen a doubling of that, it's still a very small piece of the overall project cost.
Nathan Jones: Got it. And then my follow-up on ESS, which is where I would have actually expected to hear you talk about some gross profit pinching there as that business has typically had a little bit more difficulty passing through steel prices. So maybe you can discuss the price cost dynamics there? And I guess, maybe why you're not seeing some more price cost headwinds in that business?
Stephen Kaniewski: Yes. There's a couple of reasons. First off, our lead times in that area, due to our operational improvements last year, allowed us to not have to, let's say, book orders ahead of where we would actually have inventory. And so therefore, we've been able to rapidly increase price to not create the same mismatch that we would have had in the past.  Additionally, some of our steel hedges and physical hedges there cover us through that lead time period. So there is a nominal impact, but not one that's significant enough as compared to the utility industry, where steel is such a dominant piece of the cost equation.
Avner Applbaum: And maybe just one more point there, right, ESS also has a lot more international presence, and we're not seeing that much pressure in the other regions of the world.
Operator: The next question is from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman: Congrats on a great quarter. Steve, you talked about the really strong utility backlog. And then I guess, coupled with this first quarter order sort of a 2-parter, and that I'd just be curious what the pipeline looks like beyond that? And I guess second is what's your capacity to take on more business here?
Stephen Kaniewski: So I'll answer the first part. The pipeline itself remains very strong. There's a lot of pending projects out there, not again to the size and scale of the one in the southeast. But just a lot of grid resiliency and renewable projects. When we look at all the trade publications, when we talk to our customers, and with those return on equities around transmission, it looks strong.  From our capacity perspective, if you recall, we added capacity in the first half of 2020. That capacity is now even more efficient than it was as it came online. Our lean efforts allow us to find ""more hours"" available for production. And we've really looked at the way that we're utilizing our footprint for various parts of product lines underneath of that to allow us to be able to meet what is out there in the marketplace.  So right now, we don't have any kind of capacity constraints. And with the pipeline that's out there, we remain confident that we're striking the right balance of capacity versus price. We're very careful to not repeat what occurred back off of 2013 into 2014, where the industry overbuilt.
Brent Thielman: Got it. And then -- I mean it sounds like communications outside of irrigation could be one of your fastest-growing product lines. I think you said 15% growth for the year. Obviously, we didn't see it here in this fourth quarter and understand the spectrum auctions are going on. What sort of visibility -- any sort of background you can offer that supports that ramp-up in '21? I'd be really interested to hear that.
Stephen Kaniewski: Sure. Even through the early part of the first quarter here, we've seen the order rates increase amongst all of our different customers. So as they finish the spectrum auction and obviously playing $80 billion, they have to put that $80 billion to use. And so we've quickly been able to see both quote rates and our own order rates in there increase through the first part of the year. And we've talked to many of our customers, and they're all moving forward aggressively to address the 5G rollouts, whether that's our components business or even our small cell solutions, the order rates are very favorable.
Brent Thielman: And that includes the macro towers? Sorry...
Stephen Kaniewski: Yes, macro towers, they were a little slow at the end of last year, but we've seen them bounce back as well through the first part of the first quarter here.
Operator: . Our next question is from Jon Braatz of Oppenheimer.
Jon Braatz: Steve, in the press release, you mentioned that you saw a significantly higher renewable energy product revenue. And I know it's a small piece of the business, and I think you might be referring to solar track. What can you tell us a little bit about developments in that area?
Stephen Kaniewski: Yes. Thanks, Jon. It was actually both parts of the generation. So we saw more wind towers out of our SM facility in Denmark as well as solar trackers, which is, again, a global product line and a lot of shipments in South America during the fourth quarter. And so that was the increase that we were able to see. As we look into 2021, the pipeline is very strong. The CAGRs in that market are anywhere from 15% to 20%. And we really are working on gearing up our North American part of that business as it was mostly an international business prior to that.  So everything there points to a multi-year kinds of build-outs around renewables. And obviously, the Biden administration has some aggressive plans in that area as well that if enacted, will just continue that growth going forward.
Jon Braatz: Steve, I think on the wind tower business in Europe, I've been reading about a lot more activity in offshore wind development. But I think in the past, there's been pressures from Chinese competitors. Has that competitive environment changed at all?
Stephen Kaniewski: No, it's not. It is still a very aggressive price market around the wind tower business. Again, volume has picked up, which is good, but pricing has yet to recover simply because of the pressure from the Chinese and also the Koreans coming into particularly North Europe.
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Renee Campbell for closing remarks.
Renee Campbell: Thank you for joining us today. As mentioned, today's call will be available for playback on our website or by phone for the next 7 days. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
