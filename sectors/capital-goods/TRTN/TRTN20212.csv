"Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Triton International Limited Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Burns, CFO. Please go ahead.
John Burns: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. We are here to discuss Triton's second quarter 2021 results which were reported this morning. Joining me on this morning's call from Triton is Brian Sondey, our CEO; and John O'Callaghan our Head of Global Marketing and Operations. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I would like to note that our prepared remarks will follow along with the presentation that can be found in the Investors section of our website under Investor Presentations.
Brian Sondey: Thanks John and welcome to Triton International's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'll start with slide three of our presentation. Triton achieved outstanding results in the second quarter of 2021. We generated $2.14 of adjusted net income per share, an increase of 12% from the first quarter and we achieved an annualized return on equity of 26.6%. Our outstanding results in the second quarter were driven by growth in our leasing margin and a higher than expected disposal gain, resulting from a 20% increase in disposal prices from the first quarter. We expect our adjusted earnings per share will increase again from the second to the third quarter driven by strong growth in our leasing margin. Our excellent results are being supported by very favorable market conditions. Strong trade volumes and ongoing logistical disruptions are driving exceptional container demand. And this exceptional demand is driving very high prices for new and used containers and exceptionally high container utilization and leasing rates. In addition shipping lines are relying heavily on the leasing market for their container needs. Triton is making the most from this extraordinary market opportunity. We're achieving outstanding operational and financial performance and we're investing heavily in our container fleet. We estimate Triton is achieving something in the range of a 40% share for new leasing transactions this year as our customers seek access to our industry-leading container supply capability and the $3.4 billion of containers we've ordered this year have already locked in over 25% asset growth. Our strong leasing share this year is also further securing our position as the go-to supplier in the industry and further extending our scale and unit cost advantages. We expect our long-term performance will be meaningfully boosted by the transformations occurring within Triton's business and our market.
John O'Callaghan: Thank you, Brian. Turning to page 4. Page four illustrates the goods consumption remains high and continues to drive trade cargo volumes. The upper left chart shows the good spending remained strong and consumption has been sustained, even as service spending has started to return to normal. It's not a case of either all. In the bottom left chart, the ratio of inventories to sales, remains historically very low. While there remain insufficient goods on the shelves, the logistical challenges continue and is widespread, with yards terminal and rail networks remaining congested. In addition, there are not enough available containers, trucks and chassis to make up for the shortfall to meet that continued demand for goods, further slowing restocking and delaying rebuilding of inventories. So we're expecting trade volumes to remain strong. Page 5, illustrates that freight rates, as well as new and used container prices have pushed to record levels, a very strong demand for vessel space and containers has created a shortage of ship capacity, pushing rates and prices to unprecedented levels. You can see in the upper right chart that new container prices are in the range of $3,800. The bottom right chart illustrates, that the sale of price of used containers, continued to increase steadily throughout the second quarter, due to the surge in demand for cargo use and the shortage of available sale containers. Page 6, shows that although container production is currently at elevated levels, longer-term supply and demand is in balance. The chart on the left shows annual production also broken out into percentages, between leasing companies and shipping lines. There are a couple of observations on this chart. We show on the dotted line, that we expect a substantial amount of new production to be built over the remainder of 2021. This would represent over 8% growth in the container fleet. This may be higher than anticipated trade growth, but container production was not much above replacement value in 2019 and 2020. And so to some extent, we're still playing catch up.
John Burns: Thank you, John. Turning to page 8. On this page, we have presented our consolidated financial results. Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $144.2 million, or $2.14 per share, an increase of 12% from the first quarter, and nearly 150% from the prior year's second quarter. These exceptional results represent an annualized return on equity of 26.6%. In the second quarter, we incurred $90 million in debt termination expense largely made up of a make-whole premium associated with the prepayment of institutional notes. Due to the non-operational nature of this charge, we have excluded in arriving at adjusted net income. We expect to recapture the vast majority of this payment through lower interest expense over the next several years. Turning to page 9. Our results in the second quarter reflect the benefits of the continued surge in container demand that started in the second half of last year and continues to generate strong leasing demand and exceptional disposal gains. Of the $3.4 billion of new containers, we have ordered this year slightly more than 50% was delivered in the first half of the year, growing our revenue-earning assets by 10.3% for the quarter and 20% over the prior year second quarter. Lease revenue was up 6.6% over the first quarter and 15.1% over the prior year. Average utilization increased 0.003% from the first quarter to average 99.4% and utilization is currently 99.6%. This near maximum level of utilization drove down direct operating expenses by $3 million from the first quarter, and over $23 million from the prior year largely due to the ongoing drop in container storage and repair expenses. We continue to issue new debt and refinance existing facilities at lower rate levels, squeezing down our effective interest rate to 3.2% for the second quarter. Our combined trading and disposal gains were stronger than expected totaling $42.1 million for the quarter, up $12 million from the first quarter. This increase was driven by an over 20% increase in dry container selling prices from the first quarter.
Brian Sondey: Thanks, John. Slide 12 highlights the significant improvement in the long-term credit profile for the container shipping industry. As John O'Callaghan noted earlier, cargo demand has outstripped available vessel and container capacity this year leading to a sharp increase in freight rates. And as a result our shipping line customers are reporting unprecedented profitability.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question today will come from Michael Brown with KBW.
Michael Brown: Hey good morning guys.
Brian Sondey: Good morning.
Michael Brown: So Brian I just wanted to start off with just a high-level question about the environment. So port congestion continues for  global trade and we're seeing the headlines about that each and every day here. So just curious what the expectations are there from your seat? What are you hearing from the shipping line as to when that could potentially normalize or how long that issue will be with us? And then on a related note, what are the shipping lines doing to manage through those disruptions as we head into the peak season? I was reading some industry articles about a pull-forward of the peak season maybe that it's going to begin a little bit sooner to try and get ahead of some of that -- those disruptions. And so wanted to hear a little bit about that and what that could ultimately mean for your business?
Brian Sondey: Yeah. Thanks for the questions. And so for sure like you, we see lots of reports that port congestion continues. And if you look at the number of vessels anchored outside of major ports like Los Angeles, it had gotten briefly better I think during the maybe end of the second quarter but it's gotten a little bit worse again. And when speaking with our shipping line customers, I think the general feeling is that the -- these various operational disruptions are not likely to clear soon. And I'm not sure anyone has a perfect estimate for when we'll see container flows get back to normal levels of velocity. But what I hear is that it's not likely this year. And so that a lot of these disruptions will carry forward some time into 2022. And I think we'll just have to see just how successful the lines are at unbottlenecking some of the points as well as just how this trade volume carry on because, of course, it's the high continuing volumes make it difficult to get the debottlenecking done. What are shipping lines doing to manage the sort of the various challenges, they're facing operationally right now. And I think the really real question about the peak. And of course retailers don't want to miss the back-to-school and holiday seasons, because the goods are of course quite specific to those things. And we hear there's, a variety of strategies out there that you've mentioned. One, some pulling forward of cargoes to try to make sure retailers and so on give themselves extra time to get the goods here. We've seen shipping lines divert vessels from major ports with high congestion like, Los Angeles up to secondary and kind of third-tier ports. But those of course create their own operational problems when you do that. But I think it just continues to be a very challenging operational environment out there with high trade volumes, and a variety of things causing logistical and operational disruptions. And I think the main thing from our side is, we just don't -- we don't hear anything is going to clear quite soon. But the one thing I would say in the context that we've been trying to provide is, eventually we will see those things normalize and trade volumes will find their natural post-COVID level, at some point here and operational disruptions will ease and the market will return to normal. But one of the things again, we've been really trying to emphasize in our prepared remarks and speaking with investors is that, when the market normalizes. We don't think that somehow we go back to pre-pandemic levels of performance, that one of the nice things about our business model is that as we've added capacity to help our customers deal with the surge in trade volumes and help them deal with the operational challenges, we've been putting those containers onto very long-duration leases which again, we believe, puts us on a new higher plateau or performance that doesn't erode, when market conditions eventually normalize.
Michael Brown: Yeah. Great, thank you for all that color there, Brian. The 25% asset growth that you essentially locked in for the year based on the delivery -- based on the expected deliveries for the year, that's certainly impressive. It's up, I guess, from last quarter. But theoretically that growth could come in certainly higher than that. So I just wanted to hear if you think about what that could run rate through for the full year? Any view into how you guys are expecting a full year in terms of asset growth that could ultimately playout?
Brian Sondey: Yes. So you're right. That -- right now those will be locked in. And I'd say that the most recent container orders we are placing were for really delivery through the end of September. And so we haven't yet placed meaningful orders for fourth quarter delivery. Usually, we see shipping lines slowing down the pace, at which they bring containers into their fleets in the fourth quarter, mostly just because the peak season is over by then. But this year of course is an unusual year. And it's certainly possible we'll see customers continuing to pull the equipment into their fleets in the fourth quarter to help them deal with these ongoing operational disruptions. And again, we pointed out in our materials that, even when goods consumption starts to normalize of course the whole inventory restocking cycle that has to happen. And so, our general prediction is, it's more likely than it might be in a typical year that we'll see demand carry through the fourth quarter. But the good thing about our business again is we don't really have to make guesses about it at least not yet. And we'll have a benefit probably of another month or so before we have to start making guesses ourselves about whether we want to order high volumes of equipment for the fourth quarter. But to the extent that the market is there, we'll continue to buy. We've got -- we're putting these containers on to again very high-value long-duration leases. And so it's an opportunity to get these investments that, we'd like to take advantage of. And if we can -- and again, we think we're providing a really valuable support to our customers at this time. And so if they have a need for the equipment we'd also like to step-up and provide it to them.
Michael Brown: Great. And let me just sneak in one more here. And I'll hop out back into the queue. But I think you touched on in one of your answers, just kind of how the earnings power has significantly improved and won't really be going back to the financial performance that you were producing pre-COVID. It looks like, kind of, your run rate on EPS is now north of $8 a share. And pre-COVID it was closer to kind of mid $4 a share range. Now look at your dividend here and the payout ratio used to be in the mid-40% range this quarter fell below 30%. Clearly, CapEx is the focus right? And there seems to still be a lot of uncertainty about what that need, will ultimately be. But I'd love to just get a little view into how you guys are thinking about, how to return as things become more clear on the CapEx side, so perhaps maybe later this year or early next year? How are you guys thinking about the dividend? and what that means in terms of the significantly improved earnings power for Triton relative to pre-COVID?
Brian Sondey: Yes. So we're always thinking about what do we do with our cash flow. And our cash flow right now is at extraordinary levels. And as you pointed out, the dividend payout ratio is probably pretty close to a, if not all-time low, pretty close to an all-time low for us right now. We've been, as you've noted too, we are focusing our excess cash flow on supporting CapEx. And right now, we're operating at mid to upper 20% ROE, that allows us to grow -- given our current dividend, allows us to grow close to 20% and maintain constant leverage, but we are growing right now a lot faster than that. And as I mentioned earlier, we see these as very high-value investments for the company and for our shareholders. And so, that, for now, remains our focus and supporting the sort of turbo growth in the business. That said, we've always believed a strong dividend and a consistent dividend is a great way for us to highlight our cash flow to our shareholders and share that cash flow with them. So my guess is, when -- at some point here, when the market conditions start to normalize or we gain more visibility about that, we can rethink what's a right level for the normal dividend for us.
Michael Brown: Okay, great. Thanks for the color there, Brian.
Brian Sondey: Yes. Thanks, Michael 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Liam Burke with B. Riley FBR.
Liam Burke: Thank you. Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John.
Brian Sondey: Good morning.
John O'Callaghan: Good morning.
Liam Burke: Brian, you're generating mid-20s ROE. The new business, your market share gains, sort of, testified to the strategic advantages that you do have globally. But is there any danger at these ROE rates that you get a marginal player in there to compete down some of those ROE numbers?
Brian Sondey: Yes. For sure, we see the fact that the kind of performance we're generating now makes others interested in the business. And we've always felt that, we provide a really attractive combination of significant organic growth opportunities, coupled with high secure investment returns. And for sure, when we go through periods like this, a very strong performance, it brings new capital in, whether that's existing players. We typically don't see start-ups, but, yes, it brings interest. The thing we always try to remind our investors about is, it's not that easy to do what we can do in the business that, we've got significant scale advantages and cost advantages from those. And also what our customers really care about, in particular, in markets like this one, is reliable access to high volumes of containers on demand. And we, at any point in time, have something between $300 million and $500 million of containers that we've ordered and keep them available for our customers at a moment's notice. And that's a pretty significant investment to make and especially in a market like this one. And it's -- again, I don't think our big customers will be interested by the opportunity to pick up a few containers here and a few containers there, in a market like this. And then again, where our advantages really shy and as the containers age and you have to go through various remarketing cycles and resale and induce also cost effectively, so while we do see the risk that good performance breeds interest and some competition down the road, we really do feel that, we've got -- that there's reasons why we generate the returns that we do and why the big customers come to us at times like this, where having access to a large amount of container capacity reliably is very important to them right now. 
Liam Burke: Great. And there's been discussion on disruptions the Suez Canal has been beneficial to your container business. But even taking the disruptions aside, the overall health of the container space has been pretty good with consolidation at the liner level and very rational behavior even though the order book is up. If we go back to more normal times, would you expect the duration of the contracts to be longer than we'll call it the historical 5 to 7 years, not 14 -- 13 or 14 but would you expect them to be higher than the traditional normal levels? 
Brian Sondey: It's a good question. Right now container leases are so long for two reasons. One is just the strength of the market. And so, we like long duration leases. It helps us lock in high returns that are available today on our investments and it provides stability to our cash flow and our accounting results. It's also driven by the fact that container prices are extraordinarily high. And in our business because we have to remarket the containers and resell them, we don't always assume that because container prices are high today they will be in the future. And when you have extraordinarily high prices what you see is that the relationship between leasing rates and container price is more than 1:1. So you have to more than recapture the percentage increase in container prices. And so, agreeing to very long duration leases is a way for the shipping lines to mitigate even higher lease rates that we need to charge right now given how high container prices are. In terms of where things go, I think a lot of it depends on where container prices go and where the market goes. We had been seeing for a number of years kind of a steady and gradual increase in the average lease durations for the portfolio and for the new deals. Now from one had been historically typical like a 5-year leasing market way back in 2010 to maybe more typically like 7-ish average durations in 2017 and 2018. My guess would be it settles back into that kind of range, but we'll have to see of course. 
Liam Burke: Great. Thank you, Brian.
Operator:  Seeing no further questions I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brian Sondey for any closing remarks. 
Brian Sondey: Yes, thank you. I'd just like to thank everyone for your continued interest and support for Triton. And I look forward to speaking with you all soon. Thank you. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
