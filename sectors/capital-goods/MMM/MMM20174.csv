"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 25, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.
Bruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President, and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2018 investor events. Please turn to Slide 2. This year's earnings conference calls will be held on April 24, July 24 and October 23. Please take a moment to read our forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please that throughout today's presentation we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures, including measures which exclude the impact of the tax cuts and Jobs Act. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll hand it off to Inge. Inge?
Inge Thulin: Thank you, Bruce and good morning, everyone. I will open with some comments on the fourth quarter and later in the call I will recap our full year performance. 3M had a strong finish to 2017 delivering robust organic growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. We posted record sales and expanded our profitability while continuing to invest in the business. Looking at the numbers, we increased to $2.10 per share, up 12% year-on-year. Note, that this excludes the impact of tax reform recently enacted in the United States which Nick will discuss in detail. Our team delivered total sales of $8 billion, an all-time high for the fourth quarter. Organic growth company-wide was a strong 6% as our fundamental strength are enabling us to capitalize on an improving global economy. This includes very good performance from Electronics & Energy and Safety & Graphics, both of which grew 11% organically. Organic growth in our consumer business accelerated to 5%, its third consecutive quarter of positive growth. Industrial grew 4% organically and healthcare grew 3%. Organic growth was also broad-based across geographic areas led by Asia-Pacific at 12% and Europe, Middle East, Africa at 7%. The United States and Latin America, Canada each grew 3% organically. Turning to margins; our team executed well and expended margins to a healthy 23% with four of our five business groups above 22%. We also continue to invest in the business including research and development in CapEx while returning significant cash to our shareholders. In the quarter we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. That concludes my opening remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick?
Nicholas Gangestad: Thank you, Inge. Let me begin with a topic that is top of mind this earning season; the tax cuts and Jobs Act, and its impact on our fourth quarter results and beyond. Please turn to Slide 5; following the passage of the new tax legislation we recorded a net tax expense in Q4 of $762 million or $1.25 per share resulting in fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share. This net tax expense includes the onetime transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as true-ups of tax deferred assets and liabilities. Excluding this impact fourth quarter earnings were $2.10 per share, an increase of 12% year-on-year. In addition, as a result of tax reform we now expect our 2018 tax rate to be between 20% and 22% versus the prior range of 26% to 27%. Inge will provide more details on our updated 2018 guidance later in the call. Please note, that the balance of my prepared remarks today will exclude the impact of U.S. tax reform on 2017 earnings. Please turn to Slide 6 to review fourth quarter sales. Sales growth remained strong in Q4, up 6% organically as we continue to outperform the markets we serve. Selling prices continue to improve throughout the year with fourth quarter up 20 basis points. Excluding our electronics businesses, selling prices were up 40 basis points; our strongest quarterly pricing performance in 2017. The combination of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 30 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. This impact relates to the fourth quarter acquisition of Scott Safety, net of the divestiture of non-strategic businesses over the last 12 months. In addition, foreign currency translation increased sales by 2.7 percentage points. All in, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 9% versus last year. In the U.S. organic growth increased 3% with all business groups delivering positive growth. Growth was led by high single digit increases in both, Safety & Graphics and Electronics & Energy followed by consumer of mid-single digits. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 12% in Q4. All business groups within Asia-Pacific posted strong growth in the quarter led by double-digit increases in Safety & Graphics, Electronics & Energy and healthcare. Organic growth was 18% in China/Hong Kong, and 7% in Japan. Excluding Electronics, China/Hong Kong grew 19% and Japan was up 5%. Moving to EMEA; organic growth was 7% in Q4 with West Europe up 5%. All business groups grew in the quarter with Safety & Graphics and Consumer leading growth in the area. Finally, Q4 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 3% led by a mid-single digit growth in consumer, industrial and healthcare. At a country level, Canada delivered strong organic growth of 8% while Mexico and Brazil were both up 3%. Please turn to Slide 7 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $8 billion with operating income of $1.8 billion, up 9.4%. On a GAAP basis fourth quarter operating margins were 22.8% or 23.8% adjusting for year-on-year impacts from M&A, strategic investments and divestiture gains. Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Leverage on organic volume growth and productivity contributed 150 basis points to operating margins. Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by a net 60 basis points, this result includes a 90 basis point impact related to the Scott Safety acquisition which closed in early Q4. The combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 40 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 60 basis points and higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 20 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.10 per share, up 12% year-over-year. The benefits from organic growth and productivity were the predominant driver of earnings growth, contributing $0.33 to per share earnings in the quarter. On our October earnings call we described four items that would impact the fourth quarter, each of them came in as expected with per share earnings headwind of $0.07 from the acquisition of Scott Safety, $0.06 from incremental strategic investments and $0.11 from our high coupon debt tender while we recorded a benefit of $0.12 from the divestiture of the electronic monitoring business. In addition, there are two other items that I would like to comment on that impacted fourth quarter earnings. First, we updated our reserves for future potential respirator mask claims that we estimate could occur over the next several decades which resulted in a $0.07 year-on-year earnings headwind. Secondly, our Q4 tax rate was 23% versus 28.2% in the prior year which increased earnings by $0.13 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by increasing benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, geographic profit mix and equity-based compensation. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.4 billion with free cash flow conversion of 268%. Included in these results is the impact of the tax cuts and Jobs Act along with a U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that we made following the signing of tax reform. The net impact of these two items benefited Q4 free cash flow conversion by 112 percentage points. For the full year free cash flow conversion was 100% with a 3 percentage point benefit from tax reform, net of our $600 million pension contribution. Turning to CapEx; fourth quarter capital expenditures were $459 million with the full year totaling $1.4 billion. Also in the fourth quarter we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. For the full year 2017 we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders including cash dividends of $2.8 billion and gross share repurchases of $2.1 billion. Looking ahead to 2018 we remain encouraged by the numerous opportunities to invest in the business to improve both, growth and productivity while continuing to return significant cash to our shareholders. Thus in light of these opportunities coupled with tax reform we are increasing the top end of our 2018 CapEx expectation $100 million to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. In addition, we now expect gross share repurchases in the range of $2 billion to $5 billion versus $2 billion to $4 billion previously. Let's now review our business group performance starting with industrial on Slide 10. The industrial business group posted organic growth of 3.9% in Q4 and 4.9% for the year. Our heartland businesses within industrial had a good finish to the year with abrasives up high single digits. Industrial adhesives and tapes and automotive aftermarket both grew mid-single digits in the quarter. Our automotive OEM business was up 5% continuing its consistent track record of outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds. Finally, the separation and purification business grew low single digits while advanced materials declined year-on-year against last year's strong comp. On a geographic basis industrials organic growth was led by a high single digit increase in Asia-Pacific followed by mid-single digit growth in both, EMEA and Latin America/Canada. Industrial delivered fourth quarter operating income of $527 million with an operating margin of 19.4%. Underlying margins were up 50 basis points year-over-year adjusting for incremental strategic investments and a Q4 2016 gain on divestiture. Please turn to Slide 11; fourth quarter Safety & Graphic sales grew 10.7% organically with double digit increases across both, developed and developing markets. Our personal safety business posted double digit organic growth in Q4 with broad-based growth across all geographies. The roofing granules business had a strong finish to the year as a result of the rebuilding efforts following last fall's hurricanes. Transportation Safety was up mid-single digits with particular strength in reflective sheeting for roadway infrastructure. This business continues to transform its portfolio to focus on the connected roadways of the future. Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically across all areas led by an 18% increase in Asia-Pacific, 12% increase in EMEA and a 9% increase in the U.S. Operating income was $406 million and underlying operating margins were up 370 basis points year-on-year adjusting for the Scott Safety acquisition, divestiture impacts and incremental strategic investments. Please turn to Slide 12; healthcare increased 3.1% organically in the fourth quarter. For the full year healthcare grew nearly 4% with second half organic growth of 5%. In Q4 our medical consumables business which includes advanced wound management and infection prevention solutions posted mid-single digit organic growth. Oral care delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter as we continue to post strong international growth, particularly in developing markets. Fourth quarter organic growth was led by high single digit increases in both Food Safety and Health Information Systems which posted its strongest growth quarter of the year. On a geographic basis healthcare grew across all geographies with continued strength in developing markets which were up 15% in the quarter. Healthcare's fourth quarter operating income was $464 million and operating margins were 31.5%. Next let's cover Electronics & Energy on Slide 13. Electronics & Energy organic sales growth was 11% for the fourth quarter and the full year. The electronic side of the business grew 14% organically as our team continued to increase penetration on many OEM platforms globally including semiconductor manufacturing, electronic assembly, displays, data centers and automotive electrification. Our energy related businesses were up 4% organically with electrical markets up high single digits, partially offset by a decline in telecom. We continue to actively manage our Electronics & Energy portfolio in the quarter with the announced divestiture of the communications markets business. On a geographic basis organic growth was led by a 15% increase in Asia-Pacific although U.S. was up high single digits and EMEA up mid-single digits. Fourth quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $334 million with operating margin of 25.2%. Underlying margins were up 80 basis points year-on-year adjusting for incremental strategic investments and the gain on sale of non-core intellectual property in Q4 2016. Please turn to Slide 14; consumer continued to deliver improved organic growth in the fourth quarter, up 5.4%, its strongest quarterly organic growth since Q4 2014. Consumer posted organic growth across all businesses and geographic areas in the fourth quarter. Our home improvement business grew double digits organically continuing its track record of strong performance throughout 2017. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands such as Command, ScotchBlue, Infiltrate [ph]. We also saw good growth in consumer healthcare with notable strength in our next care branded bandages. Looking at consumer geographically growth was led by high single digit increases in both, EMEA and Asia-Pacific although U.S. and Latin America/Canada increased mid-single digits. Finally, operating income increased 18% to $269 million with an operating margin of 22.9%. That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15 and I'll hand it back over to Inge. Inge?
Inge Thulin: Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2017 we executed a 3M playbook and deliver on each of our four long-term financial metrics which we laid out at our Investor Day in March 2016. We posted earnings of $9.17 per share, a 12% increase year-on-year. Organic growth was a robust 5% with positive growth across all business groups and geographic areas. We posted free cash flow conversion of 100% along with a return on invested capital of 21%, and for the fourth consecutive year we expanded margins companywide coming in at 25% in 2017. Beyond these financial results we continued to make good progress on our three key levers which are significant value creators. The first lever is portfolio management. In October we finalized the acquisition of Scott Safety as we continue to build strings-on-strings in our personal safety portfolio. At the same time we divested four businesses that no longer align with our strategic objectives. Portfolio management is strengthening our competitiveness and making us even more relevant to our customers and the marketplace. I will move onto investing and innovation which is the second lever. 3M's primary growth metric is organic local currency sales growth as we invent unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. That is why research and development is the heartbeat of 3M; and in 2017 we invested $1.9 billion in R&D or 6% of sales. And as you can see in our results, these investments are paying off in terms of organic growth and also our premium margins and return on invested capital. Business transformation is the third lever which starts and ends with our customers. The rollout of ERP system in West Europe is nearly complete and we have started initial deployments in the United States. I'm pleased with how our teams around the world are executing business transformation which is already benefiting our customers and 3M. In summary, 2017 was a strong year for our enterprise and we are positioned to build on our momentum and deliver another successful performance in 2018. Please turn to Slide 16; here you see our updated planning estimates for 2018. We now anticipate earnings of $10.20 to $10.70 per share, up from the previous range of $9.60 to $10. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% to 22% versus the prior range of 26% to 27%. The remainder of our guidance is unchanged. Organic growth is expected in the range of 3% to 5% and we continue to anticipate strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide 17; for more than a century the strings of 3M business model has enabled us to invest in the business while also returning cash to our shareholders; this has included a strong steady and rising dividend which is a hallmark of our enterprise. Over the last five years we have doubled 3M's special dividend and today we are announcing a 16% increase in our first quarter dividend for 2018 to $1.36 per share. This marks 60 consecutive years of dividend increases and reflects confidence in our ability to continue generating premium returns in 2018 and beyond. With that I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Ritchie: My first question is on Electronics & Energy; clearly you guys are exiting especially in the electronics segment, exiting the year very strongly yet a couple of companies in the supply chain reported yesterday very good results, yet the organic growth profile is still expected at 1% to 4% for 2018. Is that just conservatism or are there other puts and takes that we need to be aware of for this year?
Inge Thulin: First of all, we are very pleased with the momentum we see in that business and you see those multiple things that is moving us forward and it's all coming back to the way we have repositioned the portfolio in the past. We are coming off stronger in the end of the year than we went into the year for 2017. As Nick said in his remarks, we continue to be expecting on multiple platforms and that should of course reflect more growth as we go. It's too early for us however as we asked into the third week of January to exchange the guidance that we have for the total enterprise and all that business. But I would say that the momentum is there and we see this as a very positive business for us as we move ahead but it's too early for me and for us to change the guidance but I wouldn't be overly concerned at all about that business.
Joe Ritchie: Maybe shifting gears a little bit; Nick, just focused on capital allocation for a second saw that growth repurchase number went up, it seems like you've got a little bit around $4 billion or so on your balance sheet. Do -- should we be thinking about the pace of capital deployment being a little bit faster now that you have access to your international cash as well?
Nicholas Gangestad: The big longer term picture of our capital allocation plan that's not really changing, the way we're investing first in the business, supplementing that with acquisitions that we think makes sense and fit well with our business and then also returning cash to shareholders, that whole capital allocation strategy is unchanged, tax reform and the ability to access international cash a little easier does give us added flexibility. And in the short-term you're seeing a few things change, slightly raising the high-end of our CapEx range, also on our share buybacks and our 16% dividend increase. Those are the things in the short-term they are immediately changing, I will also point out that late in the year we did add an extra $600 million to our U.S. pension immediately following the U.S. signing of this into law. So in the short-term those are the things we're doing but the long-term, our overall strategy isn't changing.
Joe Ritchie: And if you don't mind me just sneaking in one more; I just wanted to ask you about FX, I saw that you guys didn't change your guidance for FX but the dollar has weekend since you originally gave guidance. So two part question; shouldn't you have a better benefit from FX or is your hedging policy not going to allow you to have an increased benefit? And then secondly, typically you're able to pass-through greater price when the dollar weakens and so if you can comment on that that would be helpful.
Nicholas Gangestad: To the first point even as recent as last week when we look at our exchange rates and the impact on our earnings, $0.10 that we guided in December that's a very good estimate for the total year. If that changes we'll start to modify that but I think that's still a very solid number to go with. To the second part of your question, I think you may have it reversed when the dollar strengthens against developing markets in developing market economies that's where we see some upward price actions that we take; it's usually not in the reverse.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Inge, can you talk about the 11% growth that you saw in Safety & Graphics in Q4? We obviously remember you saying that Safety & Graphics is the next potential big breakout candidate; do you think that the big difference now in Safety & Graphics is commodity based growth within personal safety and really starting to come back and this uplift actually looks sustainable in '18 given the higher commodity prices and maybe it's all the work you've done in portfolio management but how does that make the 4% to 6% organic growth guidance for '18 look? Could it actually end up being conservative?
Inge Thulin: Well, first of all your memory is good. I said that that is our next breakout business and it is the breakout business as we speak, right. And if you think about the portfolio there, we also in that business as we did in EEBG took some very heavy lifting relative to the portfolio, it took us more than three years, one was four years to complete, right; so you think about that portfolio how we have let some businesses get new onus where we didn't see that we could accelerate and develop those businesses to a level that we in 3M expect us to deliver, and then we build out specifically in personal safety to today be a world-class leader in the whole personal safety area. That is continuing, that's a fantastic business for us, [indiscernible] speak when you look upon the portfolio, that is -- in some cases regulated businesses and in some cases is more consumables that we capitalize on. So in my view the other thing that is working as a positive for us is, we have now sought out also our portfolio in traffic safety. Traffic safety today is back to the core, is back to what we know how to do and where strings are; and as you know, we are also linking that business now together with automotive electrification where we now have automotive, we have EEBG and we have Safety & Graphics working on initiatives around that whole space. So I would say that again, it's a little bit early but the momentum is very good in that business, generally speaking, and it's not only personal safety. We saw now for the first time a shift to us in traffic safety that will actually be positive for us as we move ahead. Again, it's too early, I would like to make changes if you can or you're very confident to the growth rate for the year but as you know, I'm also a little bit conservative so I will wait with that, do we have at least one or two quarters behind us so we with confidence can give you different figure. But again, this is a fantastic business and I'm as proud of what they have done a some in EEBG in terms of really direct those businesses to much more relevant place for us where we can grow in a very profitable way?
Nicholas Gangestad: It looks like you're stationary in office business with consumer goods sit first time in several quarter and you mentioned in the presentation itself the e-commerce. Do do you think the channel environment issues that you've facing in that segment are behind you or is it that you've just getting penetration into those feel even three things in math fragmenting out behind you or is it that you're just getting better penetration into the van market three commissariat off the channel inventory issues. I think is both, you know we have talked about that business for some quarter in terms of the inventory position for them right and we have -- I think in every quarter have had better sales out than sales in right; so they have adjusted their position in that space. So I think it's both, you coming to a point where your comparison is easier but also inventory levels is on a better level. So we don't see at this point in time an issue with inventories in that space for the consumer business. So this is in fact the third consecutive quarter that our consumer business group is growing, this time by 5% and in fact also to a price which is very good. On a companywide as you touch on online sales, for us in the quarter our online sales as an enterprise was up 21% and for the year was 13%; so it's moving in the right direction for the consumer business so we're very pleased with that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Davis: The sky assets you bought, it's an interesting business; if there is one reason another title is never really able to grow it -- I think it was kind of 1% grow forever. What can you guys do differently with this thing? Is it more function of -- taking the brand more globally? Is there other things that you can do to get it upto really a 3M average growth type business?
Inge Thulin: I think first of all for us that brings synergy, it brings scale and efficiency into the SCBA priority categories, right. So I think from that perspective we can add it in and become much more relevant to the customers on the market. And so the presence in gas detection is becoming much much more relevant for us and it enhanced our ability to deliver on customer solutions; so if you think about that whole personnel safety space if you like, we have now build that out from initially started to be world leader in respiratory products and then we purchased some years back, maybe 5 to 8 years back we purchased cornels [ph] welding business and then here in the later years we purchased capital safety which is full protection and now Scott Safety that is building us out in that whole space. So by definition we will be able to drive the synergy in scale in that business and be more relevant to big customers around the world, right. They are looking for as few supplier as possible but this is a regulated business, they also would like to work with companies that have a high reputation around quality and safety and that's what we stand for. So there is a lot of leverage there for us and that business is doing very well for us. We met the expectation in the quarter, the team is very energized, both our core team and the Scott Safety group that came into us. And you'll be able to now to manufacture and innovate safe products based on our technology. So we can add more on the technology side and I think we will be very effective into commercialization part of that business.
Scott Davis: Obviously, it's a great brand and anything called Scott has to be pretty good. Getting exciting I asked you a question that's kind of a little bit off the path here and I haven't asked this to any companies yet; I mean this Tax Act thing is really interesting and I haven't heard anybody comment whether this is something that can help you cut your tax -- your corporate G&A tax cost and supply chain. And what I mean by that is, I know that some companies didn't necessarily have the most optimized supply chain set up but inter-company, things moving around essentially just to avoid taxes -- I'm not accusing you guys of avoiding taxes, just saying there is some structures that were created maybe that weren't efficient overtime. Is there anything there and as far as actual costs that come down from this Tax Act is it just the fact you're just paying lower taxes or is this real -- is there something else there too?
Nicholas Gangestad: Scott, there is a couple of things I'll go into on this. One is, we've been on a journey for several years to be really optimizing our supply chain and how to operate that as efficiently and effectively as possible and part of that has been our centers of expertise that we've set up in different parts of the world to drive operationally efficiency; that also has some tax benefits to us and the strategies that we've put in place to optimize our supply chain that were relevant before, continue to be relevant for us and driving benefits for us going forward, in fact we're going to continue that type of effort and expand that. Underlying of the impact of the tax reform; there are different pieces of that, some impacting different companies differently, obviously just lowering the tax rate to -- in the U.S. to 21% is a benefit to a company like 3M. But in addition, the U.S. Tax Code, the new U.S. tax law does give some favorable handling to companies that are net exporters out of the U.S. and part of the benefit that you're seeing 3M as we guide 20% to 22% is that we're a net exporter of approximately $3.5 billion out of the U.S. of what we manufacture, that's also part of that benefit that you're seeing for our company.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
John Inch: Nick, why did U.S. pricing -- I apologize if you said this before; it looks like it got worst sequentially but you had very easy comparisons from last year. I'm surprised the U.S. went from minus 2 to minus 7 but your price in the U.S. goes from minus 2 to minus 3; what -- 0.3 obviously; what's going on?
Nicholas Gangestad: John, throughout all of 2017 -- I'll frame it just a little bit longer where -- if I go back to '15 and '16, less growth in the U.S., part of our focus in 2017 is ensuring that our U.S. operations are growing and productive and that's what we've seen so for instance in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter growing 3% organically. Now throughout the four quarters of 2017 in our U.S. we've been hovering around 20 or 30 basis points of price decline, the single biggest thing driving that John has not changed throughout the entire year and that's that as we now be -- now moving to growth in the U.S. we do have rebate incentive plans with our most loyal customers and our best performing customers that's been part of our business model and part of that model is, they get some price break via rebates and that's by far the single biggest thing impacting price that we're posting in the U.S. in 2017; really unchanged from the other three quarters of 2017.
John Inch: [Indiscernible] is not showing up within your segments because U.S. industrial core growth was up only 1% this quarter and it was up 5% last quarter but -- so I'm assuming that's not an industrially weighted rebate program, is that kind of on the consumer side, is that why consumer did a little better or…
Nicholas Gangestad: John, there are some aspects of that in all of our businesses but the U.S. and Safety & Graphics I would say are more heavily weighted to having those types of pricing plans.
John Inch: So was there something about U.S. industrial as to why it seemed like its core growth slowed considering we're sort of living in what appears to be an accelerating industrial economy, certainly in the fourth quarter. Was there timing issues or mix issues or what was going on there?
Nicholas Gangestad: Yes, if you're looking at our growth in the U.S. in industrial, the one big thing I'll point out is fourth quarter of last year of 2016; we had approximately a $40 million defense contract that we won and sold that -- that quarter -- that is -- that's the single biggest thing, if we pulled that out we have had very nice accelerating growth in our industrial business.
John Inch: Kind of at what level though? So if you were to apples-to-apples, that defense business where is the U.S.? I'm just trying to get a sense of how your U.S. business is cadencing; is that kind of a low single digit, mid-single digit, what's the trend?
Nicholas Gangestad: Pulling that out we would have been in the mid-single digit range, John.
John Inch: Okay, so that makes sense. And then, just -- back to the pricing lastly; it's sort of obvious that there is inflation in the economy, I mean how far the inflation -- I mean U.S. economy, how far it carries is another matter but maybe Inge, what are your thoughts or neck it toward being able to recapture your own input cost pressures whether they'd be healthcare, rising wage pressures, other sort of things and being able to kind of pass that through and you sort of juxtapose that against what you've just described as a price down program to try and stimulate some U.S. volumes. So I guess this is rising in U.S. inflation and possibly a bit of a headwind incrementally for margins or how can you manage it?
Nicholas Gangestad: John, over a period of time we've been able to get 30 to 50 basis points of price growth. Now in 2017 we were approximately flat on price growth, we're highly confident in 2018 that we'll be back into the range of 30 to 50 basis points of price growth over – throughout 2018.
Inge Thulin: John, let me also correct you on one thing. You say the price down [ph] initiative is not the price down initiative; it is what Nick said you know, what is happening -- there is an increase in the incentive program rebates to the loyal customers and channel partners, that's what it is. So it doesn't start with a price down initiative and I'd like to correct you on that, it's not the price down; so what you see on that line with Nick clearly said to you and to us is to say it's about the incentive programs and we have set up now for two quarters in a row.
John Inch: Yes, I'm sorry; the volume rebates, the more you buy…
Nicholas Gangestad: I thought you said price down and that's not correct.
John Inch: No, I think I misspoke. I do know what you mean and taking into -- I'm didn't mean to provide a cutting price, you're giving incentives for people to buy more.
Nicholas Gangestad: Exactly.
John Inch: So my last question that is the 30 to 50 given the pressures in the economy is that going to be enough Nick? Like, I don't have visibility into how much the emerging inflation in The United States is actually going to potentially pressure your operations; I mean historically you've got very strong margins so I don't expect substantial margin pressure, I just want to think -- understand how you're thinking about managing this.
Nicholas Gangestad: Yes, in terms of how we're thinking about and managing 30 to 50 I feel highly confident on. Directionally, I feel there is more upside on that than downside, partially for what -- exactly what you're talking about John that inflationary environment and increasing raw material prices; if there is a bias towards that it's towards the high-end or above and not to the low end or below.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Deane Dray: Couple of questions on the slide deck Page 8 on GAAP adjustments; and for Nick just starting on the tax rate, the benefit this quarter you called out supply chains but it lacks excellence and geographic profit mix. At $0.13 that's not related to tax reform, is that correct? And is this more -- is this a sustainable benefit or how would you characterize it?
Nicholas Gangestad: Deane, you are first of all correct, that has nothing to do with tax reform that we've isolated separately. And the three things I talked about, let me give you a little more depth of that -- of what's driving that. Year-on-year we are seen, our centers of expertise and their efficiency and the profitability in those grow and that's certainly a part of our strategy and sustainable that we expect and also captured in our 20% to 22% guidance for 2018. The geographic profit mix which is the smallest of the three is where do we actually earn that profit, how much is being earned in our highest tax jurisdictions versus the lowest and that will vary from year to year. And then the last is stock-based compensation, and we get a tax benefit as we have more of our employees exercising stock options; that one will be the most variable and as our stock price has gone up and we have employees exercising stock options we're getting a larger benefit from that than we've had a year ago.
Deane Dray: And then just as a follow-up; we're going through the segment color, auto came up a couple of different times, once in the electronic side on auto electrification and then it's always been in industrial. I'm just -- would like to hear from Inge on how you coordinate when a business or an end market crosses segments, the go-to-market strategy and -- are there additional kind of coordination efforts that need to make sure it goes smoothly?
Inge Thulin: Yes, there is. So first of all, we have appointed a Vice President to lead a portion inside of automotive that we call automotive electrification, and it's he that is coordinating the activities going on in the company relative to the face into the automotive business. We also monitor and manage the result out of that enterprise, so we look upon what we have called -- still call automotive business, OEM business and then we have a line out that we call automotive electrification underperformance of that; and we see that we are improving our performance in automotive electrification. So that piece of the business we had 15% growth in Q4 and in total of automotive we have done very, very well as well. So that piece is growing overtime and as we have said earlier, that's a $6 billion addressable market opportunity growing maybe 6% to 8%; and so that's big opportunity for us when we add those two together. But it's working very well for us and -- then I said earlier; I think in addition for us from a competitive perspective is that we are both very engaged with the automotive OEM customer but also with the highway transportation authorities across the world in order to build out something that I think can be remarkable as you look down the road so to speak relative to that opportunity for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Obin: I just wanted to clarify on John's question regarding rebates in North America. Am I correct in thinking that you sort of have a growth rate in view and then you said rebates relative to this growth rate; so if people exceed them they get better rebates. So if you set the growth rate higher next year, rebates would kick in at a higher growth rate; is that a fair way of looking at it?
Nicholas Gangestad: Andrew, I'd say that's a very fair way of looking at it. We started with a growth expectation and 2017 is a year where many of our customers exceeded that growth expectation, getting higher rebates; that becomes part of the base as we reset those targets for the coming year. And in comparison in '15 and '16, we had below average rebate payments; so we're seeing it from '16 to '17 swing from below to above in '17. I think '18 will be more of a normalized year.
Andrew Obin: And just to go back on automotive electrification; I think Inge was quoted in The Wall Street Journal before the New Year sort of saying that you guys could have billions of opportunity from EV and I just can't resist but I ask -- but to ask at the Analyst Day, I think you sort of thought it was a great opportunity; Inge was quoted saying it was billions. If you could just sort of talk a little bit about sort of underlying assumptions about what the market looks like by the time you have those billions from EV and its billions -- $2 billion, $10 billion, anything will be appreciated. Thank you.
Inge Thulin: Well, as I said addressable market is $6 billion. And if you think about the whole area for us where we can make a difference in that whole industry and then put on the electrification to the cause, so we have some of management, we have light weightening, we have sensors were displaced, we have [indiscernible] and vertical signings and payment markings; so that's -- think about that in the whole area. If you look upon automotive electrification at this point in time, for us that's around $200,000 million in size and growing very fast. So the first billion should be in reach rather sooner than later but we'll take a couple of years. But for me and the team here, this is a unique opportunity for 3M to capitalize on our technologies and the connection we have in the industry because the industry here if you think about it, if you think very narrow then you think automotive and automotive electrification, this is bigger than that; this coming into the whole highway transportation area and I thought it's relative to regulations around it and we had been in Traffic Safety for over 80 years, we have the connection, we work with them daily; so when you put this all together we would be in a very, very good position to move forward. So you know, we're very, very encouraged to what we see and the momentum and already early spec ins on the automotive -- on platforms that will not come immediately but is coming maybe 18 to 24 months out as those platforms go into production.
Andrew Obin: And when you say $6 billion of market opportunity, should we expect 3M to capture a 3M like market share within that market?
Inge Thulin: Why not? We don't commit in order to go in and do something less than that. So that is what you should expect and that's what we expect here, we expect that from ourselves, right; so that's -- when we commit to do it we will do it the right way and we will be focused on it. So we will take market share as we move ahead and I believe when we look upon these three to five years from now, I think we will -- maybe done it right, we will all say that was a masterstroke.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Tusa: Just on kind of next year, now that you have a betted [ph] more of a turn of the car drove to December -- how do you see kind of seasonality playing out; anything in the comparisons here in electronics or anything else that we should expect when thinking about quarterly growth progression as it move through the year or is it pretty steady all around the three to five?
Nicholas Gangestad: Steve, our view is it's a pretty steady throughout the year, we're not seen any big outliers one direction or the other, it's as pretty as close to down the middle of the road as we could be.
Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then this -- the CapEx; is that a minor step-up, is that sustainable longer term or is that just hey we're going to invest a little bit here with the new tax regime and it will begin to migrate back down over the long-term?
Nicholas Gangestad: Our longer term guidance Steve of 4.5% to 5% I still see that as the right long-term view but in light of what we see in the economy; in light of tax reform, in light of investment opportunities around disruptive technologies that can help us -- make us more efficient, all that in combination is causing us to up our planned spend slightly this year but 4.5% to 5% is still the right range in the longer term.
Stephen Tusa: And then one more; just when you look at the earnings bridge that you guys gave in December, any tweak to that? I guess strategic investments this year came in a little bit lower but there were some other moving parts like the legal settlement etcetera; so any anything in that bridge that moves around that you wanted to highlight, the earnings bridge?
Nicholas Gangestad: No, it is January; so other than the update in tax we're not changing anything. As things start to play out after a quarter or two, there might be some tweaks like we're clearly watching FX and what that's doing; raw materials that continues to be a moving target for us. And then share repurchase is another one that I say we continue to watch of what it's impact going to be on EPS.
Stephen Tusa: The gain in the safety business; did that run just to profit not the revenue, correct? Just to be clear.
Nicholas Gangestad: Correct, that was all through operating income, no revenue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Winoker: Now that we're seeing Scott Safety be integrated capital; the last big one, before that I guess it was Polly [ph], so something like $5.5 billion been on the transactions and your result so far even if there was criticism about initial price paid on the street resulting to be pretty impressive as far as growth etcetera and I assume you're heading towards your return on capital targets. Are you thinking again in terms of the profile for 3M, the ability to kind of find and digest M&A becoming an even more accelerated part of the growth story at a nearer term or is it still just steady as she goes?
Inge Thulin: Well, as you know primary objective and strategy is organic local currency growth, right, and that's also why we invest in research and development with around 6%, right; last year that's like $1.9 billion, and that is the heartbeat of 3M, that is what is providing us with premium solutions for customers and premium returns for shareholders; I think that's an important element. Now we have shift activities in the portfolio in order to build out relevance with our customers and markets, and we will continue to do that in order to compliment as we move ahead in areas that we are interested to do and our pipeline is good, we have many alternatives to look upon and I think as we go you will see probably the same steady path as we had in the past. So I don't think that has changed on that as we move ahead; as long as we get the growth on the investment we do in research and development and we do as we speak and we have also as you see stepped up to growth where we had complemented with good solid acquisitions that we've integrated to the company and I don't know if you recognize that but we have also worked with -- we buy world-class asset, we don't buy something that we need to fix and try to move in; and the reason for that is there should be good processes in place from the company we buy, there should be world-class management that can come into 3M and with this -- the four fundamental strings we have we can create value as fast as possible for our shareholders.
Steven Winoker: Nick, maybe you could put a fire point on the commodity side; I mean I know when a lot of the factories on that -- heist [ph] is another -- you guys appear certainly more vertically integrated than a lot of other multi-industrial model for a lot of reason but maybe just refresh us in terms of what the commodity exposure is these days and how you're thinking about just that side of the framework?
Nicholas Gangestad: Steven, in total we've spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion a year on raw materials, commodities and some purchase finished goods to go into our cost of goods sold; it's approaching half of our total cost of goods sold. And it is spread out over a lot of different commodity basis but to put a bit of a finer point and this may or may not be what you're asking; we are seeing underlying commodity prices that were paying, we're seeing them go up and yet we are still reporting all in that we're getting some of the benefit. So in the fourth quarter it's a bit of a transition quarter for us that we are seeing slightly higher market prices we're paying for our commodities which currently are being more than offset by our own sourcing initiatives to bring down the cost of the materials and that can be revamping our products to use a lower raw material, can be changing the source of supply, can be some negotiations that we go through; that's still resulting in a net benefit for us year-on-year but the underlying commodity prices we are now seeing a year-on-year increase in those prices.
Steven Winoker: And can you size that all that the increase itself?
Nicholas Gangestad: 1% or slightly less than 1%; it's still a pretty muted number for us.
Steven Winoker: And if you were advising investors to look at a few specific commodities for that 1% which one should we look at?
Nicholas Gangestad: There is about one-eighth of our entire commodity base that is petroleum based and when we first set our guidance we had an expectation of oil prices in the $50 to $60 a barrel, that's gone up; so there is some sensitivity there for oil derivative products that go into some of our tapes and adhesives and films.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line to Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicholas & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Robert McCarthy: On Steve's question about commodities, in particular oil; I mean in the past you have given a little bit more granular sensitivity, particularly in the retrenchment that occurred in 2014 through mid-2016 timeframe. Could you just kind of level set expectations on the upside with respect to that given the fact that oil started to move up pretty materially here and we could see even a potential oil shock if there is a geopolitical hiccup of some sort. And then, just -- if you could talk about maybe the embedded energy exposure of the portfolio overall because we probably learned a lot from the downturn about businesses that were tied into energy and affected the interim [ph] organic growth and how do you think about that sensitivity if we start to move our way up with the whole petrochem complex?
Nicholas Gangestad: Rob I think there's a couple different dimensions; I'll talk to the raw material side and then I'll talk to the market dimension side. What I've said in the past is a $10 move in oil manifest for us in about a $0.02 to $0.03 annual raw material headwind for us or $0.02 to $0.03 whatever direction oil is moving, it's going up, it's a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind for us and that comes from things like -- some of the resins we buy that have a crude oil derivative that goes into that. So that's on the commodity side but I think you also might be talking about the market itself; so when we saw oil prices drop late '14 into '15 our overall market exposure, we still see about 3% of our total revenue that's tied to the oil and gas industry. So if there is -- as we've seen that stabilize that's been a help to us and if there is an uptick that's certainly a positive for us on the revenue perspective.
Robert McCarthy: In the context of these continued progress on these European investments could you just kind of level set what your expectations for asking to be a longer term for SKU rationalization of the company? And what that could mean from benefits not only to operating margin through simplification and then working capital benefits, just risk -- you're carrying probably less inventory and less complex inventory; could you just talk about that?
Nicholas Gangestad: What we've laid out is that by 2020 we expect $500 million and $700 million of operating income benefit through what we're doing through our business transformation, as well as $0.5 billion of working capital coming out of our supply chain as a result of that; that remains unchanged. And in December I think if you were listening to what we are saying, we also are starting to see benefits beyond that that it's not a just a plateau of that and it's a steady state, we see that continuing to grow. Now topics like SKU rationalization, that is one component; we don't have it carved out of this is exactly what SKU rationalization is of that total piece but what we do see is looking at our portfolio, the SKUs we have which ones make sense which ones don't, that is part of what we're doing as we transform our business and our business processes. So it's a component, what I can't tell you is how much of a component that is of that total $500 million to $700 million that we're projecting.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff [ph] of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Nick, I've seen a few multinationals unable to bring down tax rate as much maybe all of us would have thought on some of the simple spreadsheet map, obviously that's about the case here for you. Some company is mentioning this so-called guilty tax as minimum tax issue, does that not apply to you? Does the export situation negate that? Can you give us -- if it's possible to give us a nutshell answer to that.
Nicholas Gangestad: The acronym guilty and the acronym beat those components that I know are negatively impacting some other companies are having a negligible or non-existent impact on 3M.
Unidentified Analyst: And then I was also just wondering back to the discussion around equity compensation on tax rate; any change on how we should think about the flipside of that equation, in other words the differences between gross repo and net repo as you deal with the dilution on the shareholder -- I'm sorry, on the employee side?
Nicholas Gangestad: In the past we've said that we need about $1 billion of share growth -- share repurchase just to offset that dilution; that's come down slightly, I believe it's right now around $800 million. That's not changing materially and we're thinking the $700 million to $800 million is a more longer term steady state of what we need just to offset dilution.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just finally, I heard what was said on the bridge; one that just jumps up for me a little bit though is pension. If I think about all those 2018 bridge items with the contribution here and I think a decent bump on the long. Is that dime [ph] a pension headwind fully baked in the cake or is that possibly moving around a little bit?
Nicholas Gangestad: That is the final number, so as the pension contribution helped it the lowering of interest rates and therefore our discount rates in the last few weeks of December more or less offset that; so it's call those a push and where I still write at the dime that we said.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: How should we think about incremental margins over the year that is -- should wage and input cost pressure increase in the second half?
Nicholas Gangestad: In the second half of 2018?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes.
Nicholas Gangestad: No. As far as wages what we're expecting for wage costs increases in 2018; it remains very similar to what we've seen in the last couple of years, really no change on our ability to generate incremental leverage. So we are not seeing a shift up or down in the pace of wage increases that we've seen historically.
Unidentified Analyst: And the second question; how long can you sustain the current pace of growth in Asia before you need to accelerate investment in new capacity?
Nicholas Gangestad: So we have been consistently investing in our capacity in Asia, working to increase our regional self-sufficiency of more and more that we are selling in the Asia Pacific is being manufactured in Asia Pacific. Right now we still have capacity and we will continue to sustain it, I don't see it a dramatic change in direction of the amount of CapEx going in, it's been at about the right pace and we think it's a pretty sustainable pace we're at; so I don't see a big direction change on that.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.
Inge Thulin: Thank you. To wrap up, the fourth quarter capped a strong year for us here at 3M; and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 3M team for their contributions to a successful 2017 and for moving us closer to our vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life. We are positioned well going into 2018 and we will deliver another successful year. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."
