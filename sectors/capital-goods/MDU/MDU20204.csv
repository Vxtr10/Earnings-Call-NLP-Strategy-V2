This call is being broadcast live to the public over the Internet and slides will accompany our remarks. If you would like to do the slides, please visit our website at www.mdu.com and go to the Events and Presentations page under the Investors tab. Our earnings news release is also available on our website. During the course of this presentation, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although the company believes that its expectations and beliefs are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ materially.

We will also reference EBITDA throughout this conference call, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. For reconciliation of EBITDA to net income please refer to the earnings released filed yesterday. For our call today, I will discuss the key financial highlights and then turn the presentation over to Dave Goodin, President and CEO of MDU Resources Group. After Dave's remarks, we will open the line for questions. In addition to Dave and myself, members of our management team who are available to answer questions today are Dave Barney, President and CEO of Knight River Corporation; Jeff Thiede, President and CEO of MDU Construction Services Group; Nicole Kivisto, President and CEO of Cascade Natural Gas, Great Plains Natural Gas, Innermountain Gas and Montana-Dakota Utilities; Trevor Hastings, President and CEO of WBI Energy; and Stephanie Barth, Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller of MDU Resources. Yesterday after market closed, we announced our 2020 earnings of $390.2 million or $1.95 per share, which is the second best earning results ever in our 97-year history. This compares to 2019 earnings of $335.5 million or $1.69 per share. Earnings in the fourth quarter were $112.3 million or $0.56 per share, compared to $95.1 million or $0.47 per share in 2019. That is an increase of 18%. However, our Construction Materials and Contracting business earned a record $147.3 million in 2020, up 22% from 2019 earnings. This increase was driven by higher gross margins as a result of higher realized materials pricing and margins, specifically margins for our asphalt and asphalt-related products which benefited from lower energy related costs.
Dave Goodin: Well, and thank you, Jason. And good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us here this afternoon. MDU Resources had an outstanding year in 2020, with record results from both our Construction Materials and Construction Service companies, and strong results from our regulated energy delivery businesses.
Operator:  Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ellinghaus from Siebert Williams. Your line is open.
Chris Ellinghaus: Hey, everybody. How are you?
Dave Goodin: Hi, Chris. We're doing well. Hope you're doing the same?
Chris Ellinghaus: Yeah, everything's fine. Margins are really quite exceptional, particularly at construction materials. Last year, you did mention having some asphalt benefit from the low energy prices. Can you just sort of talk about what your thought process is, what you're seeing, what’s making margins so exceptional? And if you did have a benefit from asphalt and oil prices, you know, how do you see that play out this year? And if you see oil prices rising, how might you be offsetting that elsewhere?
Dave Goodin: Sure. Chris, I'll ask Dave Barney to weigh in. But just to clarify, are you - is your question referring to our margins specific to 2020? Or…
Chris Ellinghaus: Yeah.
Dave Goodin: Because of the low energy prices in 2020 and the uncertainty of 2021? How are we thinking about our margins associated with our asphalt oil products in ‘21?
Chris Ellinghaus: Yeah, that's basically the crux of it.
Dave Goodin: Okay, perfect. I'll call on Dave Barney, who was calling in remote, But Dave, can you start with that response for Chris?
Dave Barney: Yeah, I can Dave. Hi, Chris. Yeah, our asphalt-related products because of the oil ups and down in the beginning of the year or the pandemic, this last year, we were able to buy asphalt oil at a better pricing. And we got better margins on that. So that really helped in that industry - in that business and it helps with the hot asphalt. And we continue to move pricing on our ready mix and aggregates and different byproducts. So we can - we think that's going to continue through 2021. Not so much on asphalt oil prices have gone up, but on our other product lines, we expect to continue to get price increases.
Chris Ellinghaus: Okay. So you said you expect flat view to slightly higher margins. You know, given that you did have some sort of tailwinds from the asphalt, what fills in that difference in 2021 view, just the aggregate pricing?
Dave Barney: Aggregate ready mix pricing increasing - will be increasing or – we’re trying to increase or add  products or mix. But we're also pushing pricing on our product lines. And right now, they've been sticking. We've been getting them. We were helped out to last year on some of our margins by low field  pricing.
Chris Ellinghaus: Okay. And should we be expecting, you know, you had a pretty extraordinary fourth quarter earnings wise, and you sort of warned us that you had a lengthened construction season. But should we be expecting that the construction season has been extended? Or was this really truly an unusual fourth quarter?
Dave Barney: Well, you know, we can never predict what the weather is going to do from quarter-to-quarter. And usually that fourth quarter, you can really make a great year for us or, like an average year and we had great weather, where we were able to work longer in that - in November and December in some of our areas, so that definitely helps. We've seen it happen before, we saw somewhat of the same thing in 2019. So yeah, weather definitely helps early and late, Chris. If we can get out early in the weather, you know, crop  rates when we get out early, and we can work a little later and we have the work to work on. And then later month, that helps.
Chris Ellinghaus: Okay. One last question. I'm hearing that there's some pretty significant construction work in California. Are you seeing unusually high levels of state demand for construction work?
Dave Barney: Yeah. California looks strong. Even on in California, we're seeing the private side, warehouses and residential subdivisions. And we're excited about seeing the private side continue big warehouses. And the DOT work, there's quite a bit of DOT work out there. So yeah, California is looking strong.
Chris Ellinghaus: Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Thanks, Dave.
Dave Barney: You’re welcome.
Dave Goodin: Yeah. Thank you, Chris. I'll just follow on Chris. Dave talked about some of the extended season that we saw, that that was helpful, you know, somewhat offsetting that in certain markets, and I think it points to our geographic diversity that Dave runs his business in 15 states and that we saw, you know, the wildfires out west actually had a negative effect on the business for parts of the fall. And then the series of hurricanes that affected the Gulf Coast, we actually had a negative effect to. So - but I think rolling it all together, net-net benefit was the extended fall, so very good. Thanks, Chris.
Chris Ellinghaus: Thanks, Dave.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is open.
Ryan Levine: Hi, everybody.
Dave Goodin: Hi, Ryan.
Ryan Levine: Hi. I guess a couple of start-off on North Bakken. What are the remaining milestones to start construction there? And given some of the stronger growth numbers out of the Bakken recently, are there any active discussions to expand the existing customer contracts? Or add new customers to the expansion project?
Dave Goodin: Sure. Great questions, Ryan. Given it's a major project for WBI this upcoming season. I'll turn it over to Trevor to touch on both parts of that question.
Trevor Hastings: Okay. Hey, Ryan, thanks. Kind of key milestones, the next key milestone would be obtaining our FERC certificate. Which at this point we would anticipate receiving by the end of the first quarter, that would allow us to start construction early in the second quarter, and bring the project in service by November 1 of this year. In addition to the FERC certificate, you know, there is a number of permits that we need to get state  And federally, I think the other probably major key permits would be, we've got a couple of US core permits, the 404 and 408, related to the BOR  and then utilizing Nationwide Permit 12. As it relates to the Bakken rebound, yeah, the last report out of the state of North Dakota, I think production is come back to just north of 80% of its peak on the oil side. And on the gas side, it's actually up a little higher than that it's 92% of its peak flows. You know, we continue to be in front of and in contact with potential customers in the Bakken for expansion. And as we talked about before, with that project, the - you know, it has the opportunity for expansion, as we move forward beyond the 250 million cubic feet a day Dave mentioned. And lastly, it's a - you know, important project, not just for us, but also it helps with the state of North Dakota's gas capture targets or flaring targets, if you will, and helps keep the state below its thresholds that it stated, we're at 9% - or under 9%, at this point and this project would help out with that as well.
Ryan Levine: Thank you. And then, I guess, maybe switching gears. What part of the US and maybe which projects you've seen the largest increase in construction material backlog this past quarter? And have these trends continued so far in January?
Dave Goodin: So Ryan, your question is, what parts of the US are we seeing some of the pickup, if you will, that given that we've closed our backlog on a year-over-year basis, specific to materials? I just want to make sure I capture your question?
Ryan Levine: Correct. Yeah.
Dave Goodin: Okay. Yeah. Dave, you want to touch on that $673 million a backlog and where we've seen the pickup associated with it?
Dave Barney: If you're talking backlog, Ryan, we're seeing pickup in almost all of our regions. So quite a bit of pickup in the south region, doing very well in the northwest region, western parts of our states. We're seeing backlog pick up almost through all of our regions. As far as if you're talking about, where we're seeing aggregate sales, in our Idaho markets, Montana or Oregon, or California all did well. And we expect that to continue through 2021.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then one on, probably more on the utility side. If the Biden administration moves towards net zero generation by 2035, do you expect there will be any opportunities or headwinds for the utility business?
Dave Goodin: Sure. I’ll ask Nicole to touch on that one, Ryan?
Nicole Kivisto: Yeah, thanks for the question, Ryan. We are closely monitoring what's coming out there. I mean, certainly you can see it in two categories, right opportunity to build out on the renewable side, but also trying to make sure that we've got the appropriate reliability and the transmission infrastructure to get there. So as has been said, by the industry in total, I think there's certainly some - I would say, thinking that that might be an aggressive timetable in terms of getting that transition complete. And I would say that we would agree with some of the industry statements that have been made there. So you know, we'll have to wait and see, it's early on in these discussions, with Biden being pretty new here in the administration, but certainly, it's something we're following very closely. And, again, we'll react accordingly.
Ryan Levine: Okay.
Dave Goodin: Along those lines. Sorry, Ryan, I would just add to Nicole's comments that, you know, we have been obviously moving more in the renewable space and it's very - we find it economical. We're fortunate that we live in a part of the country where it's right in our backyard as well. And so it gives us some options there, particularly associated with wind resources. But we're all watching very closely and in stay tuned on this one.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then, are you working on any initiatives around RNG for your LDC business? And also any initiative to support ?
Dave Goodin: Sure. I'll ask Nicole to just comment briefly. I would remind Ryan that we've actually been in the RNG business with our own asset in the Billings area for actually by almost a dozen years now. And so it's not anything brand new to us. But certainly it's getting more headlines here as of late. And so maybe Nicole can comment a little bit beyond that, because we're seeing, you know, interest in that particular MR  Western states from developers and others. But, Nicole, hopefully I didn't steal all your comments.
Nicole Kivisto: Yeah. Thank you, Dave. So yeah, I would echo what Dave's saying in terms of you know, we currently have an RNG production facility at a Landfill in Montana. And he mentioned that already. In addition to that, we are taking RNG from several locations in our Idaho market. And then, as one would expect, we are in several conversations, in particular out in our western states around more opportunities with respect to RNG. We also have been a part of a group looking at some of the R&D related to hydrogen, as you bring that topic up as well. And so very active in conversations, in particular, like I said out in our western states as it relates to both RNG and hydrogen. So we haven't identified anything specifically in our capital program today, but are in active discussions.
Ryan Levine: Thank you. Appreciate the time.
Dave Goodin: Thank you, Ryan. Appreciate the questions.
Operator: This marks the last call for questions.  This call will be available for replay beginning at 5 PM Eastern time today through 11:59 PM Eastern time on February 18. The conference ID number for the replay is 7190434. Again, the conference ID number for the replay is 7190434. At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.
Dave Goodin: Well, thank everyone for taking the time to join us here on our 2020 earnings and 2021 guidance call today. As noted in our comments, 2020 was really just an extremely strong year for our businesses. We were able to post record results, despite all the challenges presented throughout the year. We are committed to our tagline, which is building a strong America, along with being optimistic about the opportunities in front of us here in 2021 as well. And as always, we truly do appreciate your continued interest in MDU Resources. And thank you for participating here today. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator.
Operator: This concludes today's MDU Resources Group conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
