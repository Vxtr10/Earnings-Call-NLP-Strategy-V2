"Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Evercore Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial Results Conference Call.  This conference call is being recorded today, Wednesday, February 3, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Evercore's Head of Investor Relations, Hallie Miller. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Hallie Miller: Thank you, Joelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Evercore's fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results conference call. I'm Hallie Miller, Evercore's Head of Investor Relations. And joining me on today on the call are Ralph Schlosstein, and John Weinberg, our Co-Chairman and Co-CEOs; and Bob Walsh, our CFO. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.
Ralph Schlosstein: Thank you very much, Hallie. And good morning to everyone. It's hard to believe that when we reported our 2019 earnings at this time last year everything was ""normal."" Our team was energized and ready for the New Year. Our expectations were for another strong year and many of the analysts and investors on this call were probably looking forward to wrap up earnings season and attending investor conferences in Miami. The past 12 months however have been anything but normal. So please indulge me a brief review of the year. When faced in mid-March with two simultaneous crises, a global pandemic and the sharpest economic downturn in decades, our entire business and way of life disrupted. Our clients' needs change rapidly and many of their strategic initiatives, particularly their M&A plans were placed on hold.
John Weinberg: Thank you Ralph. Our results demonstrate clearly that we are a leader in virtually every business in, which we participate and our strength in the fourth quarter in particular contributed significantly to the many records we set for the full year as a firm. We sustained our number one league table ranking for volume of announced M&A transactions both globally and in the U.S. among independent firms in 2020 and are advising on four of the 10 largest U.S. M&A transactions in 2020. In the fourth quarter, we realized revenues for many assignments that we started earlier in the year and we participated in a number of announced transactions that will close in the future. This includes advising AstraZeneca on its acquisition of Alexion, which was announced in the fourth quarter and is the largest health care deal and the largest cross-border deals since the onset of the pandemic. Our restructuring team ranked number two in the league tables for number of announced U.S. transactions in 2020. We believe that our restructuring franchise is even stronger than the league table indicates due to our diversified business base of working with both debtor and creditor clients, as well as working on both in-court and out-of-court restructurings. Our restructuring business can deliver service and advice far beyond the traditional Chapter 11 bankruptcy advice and many companies called on us in 2020 for our liability management and financing capabilities. We believe activity levels remain elevated as certain sectors and companies continue the slow and taxing recovery from the pandemic induced downturn. Our equity capital markets business performed exceptionally well in 2020 and we expect to continue to benefit from a sustained strong market for equity issuance. We continue to see strong results from our ongoing investment in this business, which has diversified our capabilities and has led to both fee-paying events and larger transactions.
Bob Walsh: Thank you, John and good morning to all. Let's kick off with our GAAP results. For the fourth quarter of 2020, net revenues, net income, and earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $927 million, $220 million, and $5.02, respectively. For the full year, net revenues, net income, and earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $2.3 billion, $351 million, and $8.22, respectively. As has been the case historically, our adjusted results exclude certain items related to the realignment strategy that began in the fourth quarter of 2019 and which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. In total, we incurred separation and transition benefits and related costs of approximately $45 million, which reflect a modest increase in the costs from our prior estimate of $43 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded approximately $4 million of special charges which are excluded from our adjusted results. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of our broker/dealer business in Mexico to its management team and we completed the transition of our Advisory business in Mexico to a strategic alliance with TACTIV, a newly formed strategic advisory firm founded by the former leaders of our Advisory business. There, there is a loss of approximately $31 million for the year included in other revenue that is related to our transition in Mexico. Our adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 also exclude special charges of $1.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively related to accelerated depreciation expense and $1.7 million related to the impairment of assets resulting from the wind down of our Mexico business. Turning to taxes, our GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.2% compared to 21.7% in the prior year period. Our GAAP tax rate for the full year was 23.7% compared to 21.2% in the prior period. And on a GAAP basis, the share count was 43.9 million for the fourth quarter and 42.6 million for the full year. Our share count for adjusted earnings per share was 48.9 million for the fourth quarter and 47.8 million for the full year. Firm-wide non-compensation costs per employee were approximately $47,000 for the fourth quarter and $172,000 for the full year, each down 9% and 11% on a year-over-year basis respectively. The decrease in non-compensation costs per employee versus last year primarily reflects lower travel and related expenses. As we continue to evolve towards more normal operations, costs associated with travel, recruiting, and other expenses will begin to increase. Finally, focusing on our balance sheet. Our strong balance -- our strong year-end balance sheet reflects the strength and momentum of the recovery in the latter part of the year. As of December 31st, we held approximately $830 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion in investment securities. As is always the case at this time of year, a meaningful portion of our liquidity will be used to fund upcoming cash bonus payments, payments related to prior year deferred compensation awards that are vesting currently, tax obligations relating to compensation awards including relating to the net settlement of restricted stock units that vest in the first quarter. Longer term, we are holding investment securities to fund payment obligations relating to deferred compensation awards that will vest in the future and to meet liquidity and regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31st, we have made commitments to pay more than $450 million related to future cash payment obligations under our long-term deferred compensation programs and these payment obligations exist at various dates through 2024. These payments are of course subject to satisfaction of established vesting requirements. This number will change in the first quarter as prior awards will vest and be paid out and new awards relating to 2020 compensation will be granted. The actions taken in 2020, strengthen our balance sheet significantly, and as Ralph, and John have noted, put us in a position to return free cash earnings generated from operations to investors consistent with past practice. I would now like to open the line for questions operator.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Manan Gosalia: Hi, good morning. Clearly, a very strong quarter here. If I can dig into the M&A environment a little bit. I appreciate all the color on the near-term strength, but can you give us what percentage of deals completed this quarter? Were those that were put on hold pre-COVID? And what percentage of deals went through in an accelerated fashion this quarter that maybe would have taken two to three quarters to complete?
John Weinberg: Sure. Let me start. We think that, it's a significant portion -- and we haven't really studied exactly how many. But a significant portion began. But what I would say and I think this is important is that, we felt the activity level continue to warm up, and as you saw things started to percolate in the third quarter, and things continued with a very positive environment in the fourth quarter. We have found that our activity level is quite strong now, reflecting on the continuing improvement from the fourth quarter. And so what I would say is, there's a significant percentage that started early in the year. But to give you a sense, we feel that the activity level right now is quite strong. And we feel very good about the types of dialogues we're having and really the interest of our clients about thinking strategically.
Manan Gosalia: Got it. Maybe on the pretax margin front. This quarter and this year, it showed that you can go well above the 25% pretax margin in a strong revenue environment. I was wondering, if the environment holds here, and we are at the start of a new M&A cycle, is there any reason why you might not necessarily get back up to the 28%-plus pretax margins that you saw back in 2018? Are there any investments that you're looking to make that are higher than the current run rate or any headwinds that we should be considering?
Ralph Schlosstein: Well, I think, we've always said that, we expect to be able to run our business at 25%-plus margins in normal environments. This year was a little abnormal. We obviously benefited somewhat from lower travel and entertainment activity. But look, we genuinely feel that, we can run our business in -- with high 50s comp ratio 58%, 59%; and non-comp ratios in the 15% to 17% range. And as I said, it's a little lower this year because of the lack of travel and entertainment -- the lower travel and entertainment expense. I don't think, we will ever set a specific target like the one in your question because there's so many variables in any given year. And of course, we always reserve the right and because it's good for our long-term value creation to make significant investments in people, if we get the opportunity to do that. And that of course could cause a temporary bump or blip in the compensation ratio above the target that I articulated earlier in my comments.
Manan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
Devin Ryan: Great. Good morning everyone.
Ralph Schlosstein: Good morning, Devin.
Devin Ryan: Maybe just to follow up a bit on the first question there, and talk a little bit more about the outlook, so I heard the word very in front of strong in the backlog comments, which I know you guys are very thoughtful about how you frame things. And so, I want to talk a little bit more about the handoff between M&A and some of the other advisory businesses. And really just as M&A is accelerating after what just seemed like a fantastic year for restructuring and then some of the other ancillary advisory businesses kind of reaccelerating. Just trying to think about putting that all together and also, what that implies for productivity. Because the M&A piece is kind of historically the biggest individual piece and seems like that's improving the most, but you still feel like you have momentum in some of these other areas, just trying to think about some of the puts and takes there.
John Weinberg: Sure. Let me just start by saying that, what we've seen in the latter half of 2020, is that, there's been a pickup and a constant pickup in the merger business. And so as we have articulated, we feel good about the fact that that activity level is actually in a good place and we're seeing a lot of -- a lot of clients really reaching out and wanting to talk about strategic situations. You also saw and we've articulated that many of our businesses whether that's equity capital markets or whether it's debt advisory or whether it's been private capital advisory have all actually seen strong activity levels into the fourth quarter. And so as a result, we really believe that we've got some momentum to our business. And that I think is what you're trying to get your hands around, which is how does that play? And clearly we're not going to project or give you any forward comments about really where we're going to end up. But I would just say that we feel good about that activity level. One of our very, very strong engines and we talked about this in our comments is our restructuring business. And we were very, very proud of their performance this year. Having said that, given the environment that we're looking at right now where credit is available fund -- there's lots of cash in the market. We would say that it would be very difficult for that business to equal its activity level this year versus last year. So there will be trade-offs in our business. But what we have articulated and I think Ralph said it well in our comments is we have really been able to diversify our capabilities and really the services that we provide clients. And we hope that that breadth of offerings for our clients will allow us to continue to grow into the future. And that's really the concept that we're pursuing right now, which is more capabilities, more applicability to clients' issues and objectives and then also continuing to add people. And hopefully those together will keep us moving forward.
Ralph Schlosstein: Yeah. I would just add one, Devin. I would just add that in the first three calls of 2020, the first three earnings calls, we said that with the pause in M&A, which is our largest business, we expected strength in underwriting and commissions and checks and restructuring. But we weren't sure that they were sufficient to offset the pause in M&A. And it turned out as I said in my opening remarks, for the first nine months of the year we were exactly flat in revenues versus 2019. So those other activities plus the completion of some transactions that had been announced before the pandemic allowed us to remain flat. In the fourth quarter, M&A had started to pick up and the other businesses were still strong. So we had the perfect positive storm in the fourth quarter where all of our businesses performed extremely well. I would urge you not to annualize our fourth quarter revenues in putting together your models for 2021. But I would say as John indicated that having quite positive momentum in our largest revenue advisory business is certainly helpful to continuing the momentum of our business.
Devin Ryan: Okay, terrific. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up here on just trying for the model to think about the trajectory of non-compensation costs, and kind of return to work and travel, obviously, benefits over the course of 2020. Do you guys have a good sense around the acceleration? It seems like maybe the first quarter will remain light. But as we get further into maybe the middle of this year that could step up materially. I'm just trying to think about some of the puts and takes as you had some tailwinds to expenses that were unusual this year that may reverse but then, obviously, continuing to invest in the platform as well. So just any help there would be appreciated.
Ralph Schlosstein: Why don't we let Bob start with that and then John or I will add something.
Bob Walsh: As I -- and I think all of us said in our remarks, we're anxious to get back to the office. And concurrent with that, we do anticipate a pickup in travel. It will be measured during the course of the year in our view. It won't be a lights on everybody back to 2019 levels. So we'll see. Getting back to the important -- getting back to the office, Devin is important for us in terms of our culture and bringing people together. So the cost per head, which is the key statistic for us, we anticipate it will go up perhaps in a more measured way. And you did pick on one cost driver, which net-net is a positive, which is we anticipate back-to-normal recruiting, which will have some upward pressure to professional fees.
Ralph Schlosstein: I would just add to that…
Devin Ryan: Okay.
Ralph Schlosstein: …none of us know with any certainty, what normalized travel will be post-pandemic when we have everybody vaccinated, and people feel safe again. My own view is it's not going to go back to what it was. Because, I think we've all learned that certain things that were done based -- including negotiation of transactions et cetera, et cetera, can be done quite effectively over video call. On the other hand, making a new business call, and developing a relationship with a client is definitely more challenging to do electronically, than it is in person. And I suspect, once it is safe to travel again, our bankers and the bank -- that every other firm on Wall Street will resume those types of activities, in fairly short order. Whether that turns out to the 75% of our pre-COVID numbers or 80% or 70% or 85% I don't think anybody really knows. But it will be the less.
Devin Ryan: Okay. Terrific, I would be there. But, I appreciate the time guys, and I congrats on a great year.
Ralph Schlosstein: Thank you.
John Weinberg: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Brown with KBW. Your line is now open.
Michael Brown: Great. Hi. Good morning.
Ralph Schlosstein: Good morning.
Michael Brown: So, I just wanted to start maybe with the restructuring. Would it be possible for you to, kind of provide the contribution from restructuring-related activities in the fourth quarter and as we think about kind of the full year 2020? Even just an approximate estimate so we can think about that piece of the revenue pie, and how that -- and then, any thoughts on how that could trend out into 2021? Is there really a lot left in the COVID-related pipeline, or is that mostly kind of complete at this point?
Ralph Schlosstein: As you know, we never break out the individual label of our advisory activities. And it's -- by the way, it's not because we don't want to be transparent. It's really because it's not easy to categorize restructuring versus debt advisory versus balance sheet repair. And so, we won't answer that question, not because we're truculent or difficult, just because we really don't know how to break this down, in a way that would be accurate for public reporting. What we will say is that the, amount of revenue that our restructuring partners touched this year was higher than historical levels. And we would expect that in 2021, it will still be very good. But as long as the markets are as strong as they are right now, we would expect that it would not be, as high as it was in 2020. Having said that, as John said earlier, our largest business by far, comes from strategic and M&A advice and that has very strong momentum right now. And I think we'd all be surprised, if our revenues from that area of our Advisory business which is the largest would be stronger in 2021 than it was in 2020.
John Weinbergs: I'd just like to add one thing which is -- and this will not directly answer your question, but maybe it will give you a little bit of a sense for, how we think about our businesses culturally. And that is that our restructuring business has some truly outstanding financiers in it. And what we always do when we're serving clients, and acting to give advice on their objectives, is we bring parts of the firm that can add value in. And so, our activity level with respect to our restructuring business is not just dependent on bankruptcies per se, but there's a tremendous amount of advice and value-add that they bring to really some of the general business that we do giving clients advice. Whether it's in terms of thinking about their balance sheets, or whether it's thinking about how to finance mergers they get very involved with us. And so, one of the things that, we have is real flex because our professionals really work hard to partner together and to really gang-tackle the problems of our clients. And so hopefully what you will see at the firm over time is, this partnership allowing us to get real leverage in our system. 
Michael Brown: Okay. Great. That's helpful color. Wanted to change gears given your equities franchise and ask about a topic that's kind of been all over the news in the past 1.5 years or so which is these the impact of some of these Reddit or meme stocks if you will. Can you speak to the puts and takes of that volatility across your Equities franchise? At this point it seems like the worst of the volatility and the delevering appears to be behind us. But do you I guess one thing that would be interesting to hear about is do you think some of that market-related volatility could impact some of the ECM issuance volumes, or do you think it will just continue as kind of business as usual? 
Ralph Schlosstein: Well first of all I think, we're really not touched in any meaningful way by this volatility because it's driven almost exclusively if not exclusively by individual investors and our Equity business' connectivity is all with institutional clients. So in terms of its effect on our revenues really inconsequential. I do think that as a general matter the kinds of individual stock moves that we've had in recent days are -- they're not the best thing for markets in general because they are indicative of the supply and demand in certain stocks, allowing the trading value of a stock to depart fairly consequentially from the fundamental earnings power and prospects of the stock. And I think we've seen some of that in the last handful of weeks. I think those sorts of things are I think never really good to see in a stock market because they generally end badly and very often badly for individual investors not the large institutions who have the wherewithal to withstand that kind of volatility. So I'm not happy to see it, but I don't have an easy prescription for addressing it. 
Michael Brown: Okay, great. Thanks, appreciate the commentary on the topic. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Ramsden with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Richard Ramsden: Hey good morning guys. So a couple of questions for me. Could we talk a little bit about the underwriting business? I mean that's obviously become a significant business for you. When you think longer term what do you think is a realistic market share within ECM? And maybe you could also talk on the about the debt advisory business, as well and talk a little bit again about what you think is a realistic market share that you could get maybe over a 3 to 5 year period of the global revenue pool in those businesses?
Ralph Schlosstein: Okay. Let me talk about the Underwriting business first. And I look at our underwriting business in -- at the beginning of 2021 in sort of -- the same way that I would have looked at our Advisory business in 2015 or 2016. And what I mean by that is, I think we have pretty consequential market share gains ahead of us. I think last year was clearly a breakout year where we both expanded the number of -- the types of things that we do with clients and adding convertible capability and SPAC capability and CAP capability in addition to IPOs and follow-ons. We benefited from that. We benefited from the fact that a much broader group of our highly entrepreneurial bankers participated much broader industries were involved. And thirdly, we benefited from the fact that our average share of the fee in any -- in the transactions collectively with which we were involved went up. And I think as a general matter, we will continue to benefit from those three things. And they will cause us to continue to gain market share. Now the revenues in any business whether it was advisory in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 or equities -- or equity underwriting going forward are a function of two things: the aggregate level of activity and our market share. I think John and I feel very confident that our market share will continue to grow and that we're not in the seventh, eighth or ninth inning of our success in that business. What we don't know is what will be the aggregate level of activity, although, we certainly know that the beginning of the year started out very strongly. With respect to debt advisory, I wouldn't even know how to answer that question, because there's no publicly available data on that. I will say, it's a business that only the independent firms can be in, because you're basically helping clients interface with capital providers many of whom are the larger firms. And it's a business that I think all of the independent firms would say that they're in, but there's no data at all on market share. So, I really couldn't even begin to answer that question.
Richard Ramsden: Okay. And then -- yes, go ahead.
John Weinberg: I was just going to add something Richard and that is that, as we have continued to add A+ type talent, what we are finding is that clients increasingly want the services with respect to our financing judgments, and how we can help them think through things. On the equity side, obviously, it ends up that we take larger and larger roles as Ralph said in financings, but also in terms of helping them think strategically about how to think about those strategic financings. And on the debt side, it's the same thing, which is that we -- because we have a very respected group of people doing this and are able to give really high quality advice, increasingly we're able to get into positions where we are adding real value-added advice and that ends up translating into higher fees. And so we think there's a lot of white space in front of us, because we don't see an end to the opportunities in terms of giving really high-quality device in a lot of the transactions and to a lot of the companies that we've been associated with.
Richard Ramsden: Okay. That's helpful. So the second thing, I wanted to ask about is post the election corporate tax reform looks like it could be a possibility again. If we do get some sort of corporate tax reform either later on this year or maybe in 2022, do you think that would have a material impact for the business either positively or negatively? I guess, obviously the Advisory business in particular.
Ralph Schlosstein: Not really. In his campaign, President Biden then candidate Biden argued -- or had as part of his plan a return -- an increase in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. It's not clear by the way with a split congress as we have that any of his tax plans will make it through. But even if he did achieve all of that, which I'm quite skeptical about the way, I think about that is that in -- at a 21% tax rate, 79% of every dollar of earnings goes to shareholders. At a 28% tax rate, it's 72%. So that's a -- it's a decline in earnings of less than 10%. If it goes to 25%, which I personally think would be more likely if we get any increase at all, it's a decline in earnings of five percentage points. So that's -- it's not nothing, but it's not that big a deal either in my view.
Richard Ramsden: Okay. That's great. And then my last question is, you talked about a strong pipeline for recruiting advisors. How would you characterize the recruiting environment today? And it's -- obviously, this is a great environment for you, it's obviously a great environment for your peers as well. Would you say that the recruiting environment is rational today in terms of what people are willing to pay for talent?
John Weinberg: I can't really make a judgment on what people are willing to pay for talent. But what I can give a judgment on is how our discussions and negotiations are going. And in general, I think, that we've found success in finding people who really like our model and like -- and are drawn to our firm and our culture. And we think that that has really afforded us the opportunity to talk to some real A+ talent. And as we've said to you, we continue to feel like there is real opportunity to pick up more talent who want to join. In terms of the rational cost of it, I don't think we have found that it is out of bounds of what we've seen in the past. I think what really happens is people look at the opportunity they have at a firm, and they make a judgment as to whether this is a firm they want to be with, whether they like to -- want to join the team and then whether they can realize their financial goals by being there. And our experience is that, in fact, we've had no problem in getting people to come over with reasonable terms. And in fact, I think a lot of people are looking at our platform and really the momentum of the platform and are making the judgment that they love being a part of an organization that has momentum. But also they realize that they can do quite well because the firm continues to have the momentum and has access to client and transaction situations that are quite attractive.
Ralph Schlosstein: Yeah. Richard, I would just add one thing and that is it is reinforced by our performance this year. John and I can consistently sit in front of anyone with whom we're having discussions, whether they're coming from a large firm, a full-service firm or from another independent firm. And without any pushback from the people we're recruiting, we can inarguably say to them that if they come to an independent firm that they can do more business with their clients at Evercore than they can at any other firm in our industry. We're the only independent -- we're the only independent firm that has equity underwriting capability. We're the only independent firm that has a world-class activist defense and shareholder engagement practice. We're the only independent firm who has the leading expert in corporate structure, splits, spins, Morris Trust reverse Morris Trust et cetera. And we're strong in everything else that you would find in an independent firm. So the reality is and one of the big draws of our firm is that bankers can do -- be involved in anything that they would have been involved in at their old firm sometimes as an advisor like debt advisory is an extender of debt, but in many cases exactly as they would have done at a large firm. And that's certainly true for example of the equity underwriting business.
Richard Ramsden: Okay. Thank you very much. That's very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.
Brennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Actually first question is going to be a follow-up on that last line of question on recruiting. We saw this year or in 2020 -- sorry I should say in 2020, the decision by a lot of the bulge bracket competitors to show some comp leverage for the benefit of the shareholders, not maintain the traditional relationship in between revenues and comp. Do you -- have you seen -- or do you expect that to have any kind of impact on the opportunity set for you on the recruiting front this year? Has that made you a little bit more bullish? And has it actually translated into any discussions yet, or would that just be expectation?
Ralph Schlosstein: Yeah. Brennan, I think that the -- what's happened in the large firms is not exactly what you just outlined. I think what happened in the large firms is the return that they've gotten on their capital has been extraordinary last year. And that allowed them to pay their people well and to pay their shareholders well and have compensation ratios that have the appearance of the more disciplined. That -- those results are in my view almost 100% or 100% a result of the extraordinary revenue and return from the capital that they deployed. And therefore, we really have not seen any effect on the compensation of individual bankers with maybe the exception of one or two firms. For the most part, the bankers that we pursue, who I often characterize as the high-ROE bankers, those who can generate revenue without necessarily being dependent on the balance sheet. Those people were compensated well last year as they have been historically.
Brennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for that. And then the momentum in ISI is really impressive. So I'm in search of a new pet project here with you guys at Evercore. So have you guys thought about strategic alternatives for the wealth and asset management business? It seems as though that's just sort of small. And at this point, it's like low single-digit type percentage of operating income for you all. Why not consider strategic alternatives given the popularity of M&A in that space and use the capital to either return to shareholders via buybacks or fund more hiring?
Ralph Schlosstein: Well, first of all Brennan, I really appreciate you taking on a new pet project. Yes. Look, we -- I think of the businesses that we own in wealth manage -- or in asset management. At this point, one of them is consolidated. That's our Wealth Management business. I think we do see some -- and I hate this word, synergy between people -- when we sell a business, wealth comes in and sometimes we're able to turn those people into Wealth Management clients. And sometimes Wealth Management clients have advisory opportunities as well. The deconsolidated businesses that are accounted for in the equity method are essentially investments at this point. And we always look at those from the point of view of, are they more valuable to someone else than they are to us?
John Weinberg: The only -- what I'd like to add is that the Evercore Wealth Management group is performing extremely well and we're really pleased with how they're executing their business and serving their clients and feel very, very good about their performance, their opportunities ahead and remain very committed to them.
Brennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Jeff Harte: Good morning, guys.
Ralph Schlosstein: Good morning.
Jeff Harte: A couple of I guess kind of cleanup questions. Can you give us the SMD and employee counts at year-end? 
Bob Walsh: Jeff, the Senior Managing Directors reflecting a bunch of changes that we've disclosed. So really as of today, as opposed to as of year-end is 107. And the total headcount for the firm is about 1,800 .
Jeff Harte: Okay. And were there any pull-forward of revenues, a meaningful pull-forward of revenues from deals that closed in 1Q back into 4Q?
Bob Walsh: I'll let you decide on meaningful. 4Q of this year was a bit more than $32 million. That compares with 4Q last year of a bit more than $33 million.
Jeff Harte: Okay. Thanks. And thinking about productivity, I'm getting like a per -- a revenue per SMD of something close to $16 million, in what was admittedly an unusual 2020. Is that a reasonable base case going forward? And can you parse out at all the productivity levels, kind of, across some of the different assignment types? I'm thinking M&A versus some of the areas that were stronger in 2021 like restructuring or fund placement.
Ralph Schlosstein: Yes. We would -- the productivity is, we have a slightly different way of measuring it in the sense that we count only SMDs that are in their first full year. So our measure would be a little bit higher than yours. And I think it's -- we have already industry-leading productivity compared to the other independent firms. We're probably close to twice theirs and in some cases closer to three times theirs. So our productivity is already quite good. It's aided, I think, by the fact that we do have a broader array of capabilities for our Senior Managing Directors to deploy. And I wouldn't really want to predict where it can go. In good markets, I think, it can be higher than what it is right now. I think at the beginning  we would have predicted that it might have wound up lower than it turned out to be. And so, I think we have terrific people and we have the broadest array of capabilities of any independent firm. So our productivity, the gap between us and our competitors should be maintained and perhaps even widen.
Jeff Harte: And across kind of different businesses, I mean, should we think of different businesses being more productive than others, or does it all kind of – would net out in the end?
Ralph Schlosstein: I think that, it's awful hard to do because included that 107 that Bob just gave you are people, who are capabilities or product people who aren't necessarily responsible for covering clients. So the mix that we have doesn't – really isn't amenable to the kind of categorization that you're asking about. 
Jeff Harte: Okay. And finally, you mentioned the strong pipeline of senior talent additions as we enter 2021. How should we think about operating leverage and kind of margins as recruitment ramps back up? And I'm kind of thinking that specifically relative to the last couple of years where the comp ratio kind of stepped up and you guys had referenced kind of senior hires as being a driver of that stepped up rate?
Ralph Schlosstein: I think that at this point it's not clear. We have a lot of dialogues underway right now. If all of those turned into new hires, its possible there would be a little bit of pressure on the comp ratio. But we're so – I think what we've always said is if we get that opportunity we'll take advantage of it. And we'll surely share with you that in a very transparent way. I think we're a ways away from having that kind of a discussion at this point.
John Weinberg: And just to state the obvious. We get leverage as our revenues grow. That is clearly, a really important part of how the comp ratio plays out. And so a lot of it depends on what the market gives us and what we're able to apply. We've told you that we really believe that by expanding our – both our people who can address themselves to clients as well as our capabilities, we think we're going to share in more of an uplift in the market. But clearly that is a very important part of how the comp ratio plays.
Jeff Harte: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.
Jim Mitchell: Okay, great. Good morning. Maybe just a question on Europe. It's been an underperformer for 10 years. We might finally have a little clarity on Brexit. You highlighted it as an area of geographic expansion. So how are you feeling about Europe at this point? Do you see the potential for a sustained improvement over there? It seems like we're seeing some green shoots. I just want to hear your thoughts going forward.
Ralph Schlosstein: Okay. I think, we do think that there is some pickup in activity in Europe. Europe is still as you indicated in your question well below its pre-financial crisis role in aggregate M&A activity. I don't think we anticipate getting back to that quite honestly. But there should be some pickup. We have among the independent firms the largest franchise there by far of those firms that were born in Europe -- born in the United States, sorry. So we're not as big as Lazard and Rothschild in Europe. And if Europe does pick-up disproportionately I think we would expect them to benefit more from that than we would. But we would benefit from that more than any of the other independent firms.
John Weinberg: Yes. And what I would offer is that we clearly do look at Europe as an opportunity for us. We have found that our bankers and our brand are playing well there. And so we are looking quite intensively for talent who want to join our team and we really believe that there's real opportunity for us. So you can expect that we will be looking and mining for real talent. And we will be focusing on finding some growth in Europe, especially, as the market improves. 
Jim Mitchell: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the ECM conversation. I know this is really, really long-term, but how do you think about your long-term target? Is it getting to bulge bracket levels, or is there something about being an independent boutique that doesn't have a balance sheet that would sort of keep you from getting to that kind of market share long-term?
Ralph Schlosstein: Well, first of all, there's something that the bulge bracket firms do and it's a not small part of overall equity underwriting activity, which are block trades. We're not going. So I think just as we're never going to get the league table credit that the large firms get, which they uniformly get when they extend credit we only get league table credit when we actually are an advisor. There's a certain part of the market that our market share is going to be zero. So by definition we'll never get to the bulge brackets. On the other hand, I think -- and I know John agrees with this we can be very competitive in the parts of the underwriting business that don't involve massive. 
John Weinberg: Without making a prediction the one thing I would say is that, we are increasingly seeing that we're getting opportunities to move to lead, active lead, lead left. We've continued to get those opportunities and they've built. And so we think there's real space in front of us. To assume that we're going to get to their market share or their profitability level, I think, that's -- that may be a leap certainly for now. All we're really doing right now is looking at what we think is really significant growth in front of us and we think that it's there for us to take and to keep moving. So we feel good about the prospect. But I think getting to the level that you're suggesting I think that remains to be seen. We'll see. 
Jim Mitchell: Okay. Appreciate the thoughts.
Operator: Thank you. There appears to be no questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor to Ralph Schlosstein and John Weinberg for any closing comments. 
John Weinberg: Thank you all for your time today. We really appreciate it.
Operator: This concludes today's Evercore fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.
Ralph Schlosstein: Great. Thank you."
