"Operator: Welcome to the Capital One Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. This conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.
Jeff Norris: Thanks very much, Rob and welcome everyone to Capital One’s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the internet, please log on to Capital One’s website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2019 results.
Scott Blackley: Thanks, Jeff. I will begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $5.5 billion or $11.05 per diluted common share in 2019. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were $12.09 for 2019. In the fourth quarter, net income was $1.2 billion or $2.25 per share. Net of adjusting items, our EPS in the quarter was $2.49 per share. We had three adjusting items in the quarter which are outlined on Slide 14 of our earnings presentation. First, we had a $48 million or $0.08 per share expense of launch and integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership. This brings the full year total expense to $211 million and concludes the one-time expenses related to the Walmart partnership launch. Additionally, we had an allowance reserve build for the acquired Walmart portfolio of $84 million or $0.13 per share. The reserve build as well as the launch and integration costs are recorded in our domestic card business. Lastly, we had $23 million of charges related to the cyber incident that we announced at the end of July. These charges were partially offset by an insurance reimbursement receivable of $7 million resulting in a net impact of $16 million or $0.03 per share. We continue to expect a portion of these charges in insurance recoveries will extend beyond 2019.
Richard Fairbank: Thanks, Scott. I will begin on Slide 9 which summarizes fourth quarter results for our credit card business. The credit card business delivered solid results with stable credit and strong growth in loans, purchase volume and revenue. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on Slide 10. Domestic card ending loan balances increased by $11.3 billion or 10.5% year-over-year driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio and strong growth of branded cards partially offset by our choice to exit several small partnership portfolios in the second quarter. Branded card loans, which exclude all private label and co-branded cards, grew 5.7% from the prior year quarter. Domestic card average loans for the quarter were up 9.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. We posted another strong quarter of purchase volume growth as we continued to grow our heavy spender franchise. Year-over-year, domestic card purchase volume growth was 10.7%. Net interchange revenue for the total company grew 9.2%. Revenue increased 7.2% from the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by the growth in average loans. Revenue margin declined 31 basis points. More than 100% of the decline was driven by the revenue sharing agreement on the acquired Walmart portfolio. Not-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. Domestic card credit remains strong and stable. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.32%, a 32 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio. Because the delinquency rate is not affected by the loss-sharing agreement, the addition of the Walmart portfolio put upward pressure on the fourth quarter 30 plus delinquency rate. Despite this upward pressure, the 30 plus delinquency rate improved 11 basis points from the end of the prior year quarter to 3.93%. Pulling up, our domestic card business continued to deliver strong results with top line growth and strong and stable credit.
Jeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourselves to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any additional follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Matt, please start the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.  Your first question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Ryan Nash: Hey, good evening guys.
Richard Fairbank: Good evening, Ryan.
Ryan Nash: Hey, Rich. Maybe just to start off a question for Scott, so thank you for the moving pieces on CECL across the different products, I guess, now that Day 1 is behind us, any color you can give us regarding the Day 2 impact? And maybe can you just talk about it across each of the different portfolio? And I have one follow-up.
Scott Blackley: Yes. Sure. Well, when I think about Day 2, I am going to start off by just saying we gave segment level multiples and I think they are a good foundation for you to use those multiples and apply them to what you would have been estimating under the prior regime for allowance builds in 2020. So I think that’s in general a good place to start in terms of thinking about Day 2. I think that the multiple that we have talked about could change gradually if performance – the portfolio performance or the portfolio mix really changes in the future, but I think those are going to be changes that happen over time. So the transition multiples are probably a good place to start.
Ryan Nash: Got it. And Rich, maybe just a question on both operating and overall efficiency, so you made nice progress in 2019 despite a handful of headwinds, I guess what are the biggest rate factors that could impact reaching 42 or is it the fact that everything is coming offline in the fourth quarter that you have such a high degree of confidence? And then I guess second just given where we are in the cycle, you talked about marketing being up moderately this year, is there some area where you could see it accelerating or would you expect it to remain in and around these levels plus or minus like you articulated in your outlook? Thanks.
Richard Fairbank: So, Ryan, let’s talk about the operating efficiency ratio. We are, like a year into when we set this guidance and it was certainly a stepping out of character for Capital One to be so specific of so many years out. And as we have talked all along the way, there are several things that have driven our confidence. There are certain things that are, could call the math is a little bit understating the sort of incredible work associated with doing it, but in a sense, getting out of the data centers is something that with the extraordinary achievement of doing it, we have, I think a very good handle on what the cost of what’s straddling those environments have been and what the benefit of just being all in on the cloud is. The math of the Walmart step up that is what it is, that’s contractual. And so I think that’s a very reliable thing. Another thing that aids the continued improvement here and the larger improvement in 2021 is the increased traction that we expect in our businesses that we can in fact see unfolding and that we expect to continue. Obviously, that has uncertainty around it like any estimated future businesses performance and growth, but a lot of that is sort of in the works. It can be affected by changes in the marketplace, changes in the economy, changes in choices that we make, but this is the product of the bunch of work that we have been doing, the success of our marketing and account origination in prior years which we have spent lot of time talking about and some of the technology innovation that has been going on. So, we feel good about that. Obviously, that has uncertainty to it. And the other element in the uncertainty equation is what happens to operating cost of 1 minus the data center exit and all the associated cost of straddling that will be eliminated. And there can always be risk to cost estimates, but we have spent – we have worked very hard and this is not like a new thing, we worked hard for years driving – gradually driving down the efficiency ratio and being very disciplined on operating cost. We do have some growing benefit that comes on the technology side here with respect to technology cost savings and collectively, when we put all that together, well as always there is uncertainty in this. Here we are, we had our bold shingle that we hung out a year ago. Here we are a year into it and we feel as good as we did at the time that we launched it. And I am pretty struck by in a world where so many things change how – what we had in mind is continuing to unfold and that’s because it’s the product of the lot of work for a long period of time. With respect to marketing, the first thing I want to say is we don’t give precise in most years, in many ways, we don’t even give marketing guidance at all. And what I would say about marketing is in the impression I want to leave you with is we continue to feel very good about our marketing investments. We – in card, marketing is strengthening our heavy spender franchise driving strong new account originations, growth in purchase volume, net interchange revenue, loans on the bank side, the increased marketing is fueling deposit growth along with cafe and brand awareness. We are seeing a lot of traction just overall in our brand metrics and brand equities that are critical to building a franchise. And also we are a company that doesn’t have 6,000 branches we are a company that actually isn’t at the top of the lead table in terms of co-brand partnerships and a lot of things. So, we have to build our business the old fashioned way kind of one customer at the time and our marketing machine is a key part of that. So, what I would leave you with is we continue to feel very good about the marketing. We got a new addition here in terms of the full year of the Walmart marketing. And so that’s going to be yet another factor that pulls up the numbers there. There is always – we will always make our final determinations based on the opportunities and necessities that we see in the marketplace, but I wanted to just give you that general window into how we are feeling about the marketing.
Jeff Norris: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the Day 2 CECL impact, Scott. When you look at the Street consensus provisions out there and I am just looking at our own, we are assuming 6%ish loan growth flat charge-offs and we have the provision up 20%. I mean, does that look commensurate to sort of what you are articulating or is this something else?
Scott Blackley: Sanjay, why don’t I just step back and give you little bit of a picture of what’s going to happen with CECL? So, just to go back and ground out how CECL is going to work. Allowance movements under CECL are really driven by the same factors that drove the allowance under the prior regime. So, you start off with loan balances at the end of the period, you have got expected future losses and recoveries on balances and then we have qualitative factors that are not captured in our modeling and we have those on top. Of those three factors, it’s really the second one that changes under CECL and because we are now going to be holding an allowance for the expected lifetime losses. And importantly we are also going to be having the lifetime recoveries and that’s – I will come to that in just a minute as to why that’s such an important factor. So that’s the biggest step change under CECL. So, let me kind of just put this together for you and tell you how we are going to do it. We start with a 12-month loss outlook which we forecast. We then extend that into a lifetime forecast and when we do that we assume a gradual reversion of losses to historical averages after that first year. And then we overlay that with future recoveries and future recoveries are a big offset to our CECL allowance. Prior to CECL we offset our allowance with expected recoveries for only the next 12 months. With CECL, we will be offsetting our allowance with all estimated future recoveries. And relatively speaking, recoveries have a larger offsetting impact under CECL than they did under the prior allowance regime, because we tend to see a longer tail of recoveries on our charge-offs. So, net of all of that, I think you are going to see a 1.42 multiple on our allowance in our domestic card business at the point of transition, 1.49 multiple for our auto business. And as I mentioned in my first answer, I think those are relatively stable. Your question about, well, how might this look in periods of stability and in periods of growth, let me just kind of answer that real quick. In periods of stability, you are really just going to have take that multiple and apply it to whatever allowance build that you are thinking about and that includes moderate growth and a stable economy. There is a couple of things that could cause that implied CECL multiple to vary over time. And let me give you a couple of examples. So the first is that as you know and we have talked about CECL pulls forward the allowance expense associated with new lending. And so all else equal, our implied CECL multiple would probably go up in periods of higher growth. And just to give you a bit of sensitivity there, during our growth surge in 2014 and 2015, the implied multiple during that period if we had lived under CECL would have been higher perhaps in the 1.6 range. So just to give you a sense like there is a lot of things that could move around that if we just kind of took hindsight and applied kind of where we see things we can see the multiple going up into that range. On the flipside of that in periods of high recoveries, you could actually see the multiple go down. So in periods immediately after a downturn where there is higher – we have got this big portfolio of recoveries, those might actually start to be a bigger factor and push the ultimate multiple down. So I know that was a bit of a long answer, but hopefully that gives you a sense of kind of the moving pieces of how CECL is going to work Day 2.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Alright. Thank you. I have one follow-up. Just on the Walmart portfolio, I know it was known to have a lower tender share penetration. I was wondering if that’s a big growth opportunity in 2020 and a contributor to card growth. And then just a clarification on the marketing expense outlook for 2020, would this year’s growth be moderately higher sort of that – was that a good comparison in terms of the growth rate? Thank you.
Richard Fairbank: Could you repeat the second question, Sanjay, your clarification question?
Sanjay Sakhrani: Yes. On the marketing expense growth, you mentioned moderately higher, I was just wondering if 2019’s growth rate would be commensurate with moderately higher in terms of like mid single-digits growth?
Scott Blackley: Okay. So I think what we have this year is a continuation of the momentum that we had last year. And I want to say also to my response to Ryan Nash’s opening question that one of the important drivers of 42% is the continuing traction in the business and marketing is a very important element of that. And in fact – so a way to think about it is we start with an opportunity in a sense a growing opportunity on the marketing side consistent with what we are seeing overlay that with Walmart which is a new thing. And those two things together is what is driving our guidance of a moderate increase in marketing. Rich, do you want to talk about this question on the growth opportunity from – growth opportunity in the Walmart portfolio? Yes, let me say it’s certainly an honor and an opportunity to partner with not only the world’s largest retailer actually the world’s largest company, Fortune 1 company and to launch a digital first card program. So for Capital One, the opportunity divides itself into a back book where we have converted the old Synchrony back book and we have told you a lot about the size and the general parameters associated with that. And then there will over time be a growing front book that will be the originations that we do under this new partnership. We are not going to be specifically guiding to that front book, because in many ways this will have a lot of similarity to many of the front book things that we do at Capital One. Certainly, the size of the Walmart and at this point, relative to other partnerships the penetration levels of the credit card relationships, there is certainly upside there and I think Walmart certainly believes that and so do we. But we are in the very early stages of this, but I think we are very pleased with the way our two companies are partnering here.
Jeff Norris: Thanks. Next question please.
Operator: And your next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
Moshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. You referred to a 5.7% growth in the branded cards that I think was the same number that you referenced in the third quarter, so roughly the same level as growth. Could you just talk a little bit about what the kind of the outlook is? I mean, because that does exclude Walmart, so talk a little bit about whether that branded growth is going to be accelerating or decelerating and the impact maybe on overall growth from Walmart? And I do have a follow-up.
Richard Fairbank: Yes, Moshe, so first of all, the front book of – since it starts at zero the front book by definition will be a growing book. I also want to point out the back book of Walmart with the loss rate that it has is a runoff portfolio that’s running off at a pretty sizable clip relative to portfolios otherwise that we have. So, there are going to be two forces going in opposite directions there and we will have to see how that plays out, but we are certainly very happy to have that partnership. The outlook, look I think we continue to feel good about the growth opportunities in the card business, but I think it’s more a continuation of the story that we have been talking about before in terms of we are benefited by a number of years of strong account origination. We have been over time increasing credit lines as we have validated each successive vintage. It’s coming in as good as it is and in fact if anything, the recent vintages are outperforming in a good way by a bit some of the earlier vintage. So all that is good that gives us the confidence to continue to drive the originations and also the continuing confidence on the credit line side. This is all in the context of an economy that’s already the longest in length in recorded history here between recessions. So with a cautious eye at the environment, the things that we have been talking about for a number of quarters are continuing to find traction and then very important element of that is the success of the marketing. So, that’s why we feel good about the growth opportunity.
Moshe Orenbuch: Got it. And just as a follow-up, little bit of housekeeping, non-interest income outside of interchange revenue and service fees kind of that other line was up very nicely both from the third quarter and a year ago. Was that primarily just the change in the absence of the PPI charge or are there other factors as well?
Scott Blackley: Moshe, can you just – which specific line item are you looking at?
Moshe Orenbuch: What you guys have called kind of other income, it was up like 55%, 60% of Q3 and 90% or so from a year ago, but I believe both of those had the PPI charges in them?
Scott Blackley: Yes. So, a few things that impact that line item, so other non-interest income really is driven by oftentimes marks on, on a variety of different situations. So, the first is we actually have some compensation-related assets that we mark and we take the benefit of those marks runs through this line item in revenue and there is an offsetting expense that runs through and elevates FCNB. So in the period with the run-up in the market, there was a pretty healthy amount of mark on compensation. The other thing that runs through there we do occasionally have partner payments that are coming in under the contracts. Those can run through there and be a bit lumpy. I think that the level that you are seeing in Q4 is a bit elevated to what I would expect on a run-rate basis.
Jeff Norris: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Betsy Graseck: Hi, good evening.
Richard Fairbank: Hi, Betsy.
Betsy Graseck: Just switching gears a little bit talking about NIM, I know that NIM went up nicely in the quarter, which I think you had a comment in your prepared remarks around how lower rates are little bit of a headwind. So I just wanted to square those two things and understand how you are thinking about the outlook for NIM, you had a nice decline in the deposit costs, maybe if you could speak to that a little bit?
Scott Blackley: Betsy, as I mentioned last quarter, we have been talking for a number of quarters about headwinds from deposit mix and deposit pricing and we have started to see those abate a little bit last quarter. When I look at NIM this quarter, I mentioned that there were two primary factors that drove NIM up on a linked quarter basis. One of those was asset mix which was the larger of the two factors that I described. The other factor was seasonal loan growth. So we are seeing a bit of that traction in there. The deposit pricing is embedded in that as well as things like accelerated amortization on the premiums that we have, some of the securities, all of that’s embedded in there. So overall, I think that when it comes to the impact of deposit pricing our betas have been relatively low since the declining rate cycle started that maybe an opportunity. Rich mentioned the types of factors that would drive where deposit pricing goes. So I think we will have to see where that moves to, but at this point, I don’t really see any outsized impactors whether positively or negative on our net interest margin.
Betsy Graseck: Okay. And then so mix really driving the buzz on that, when I think about the CECL outlook here and I know you have already talked about Day 2 quite a bit, I just wanted to see if you could give us some color around the commercial banking increase in your Day 1. I ask just because some of the other folks we look at had declines in commercial. So I want to understand what was driving a little bit of a different outcome for you?
Scott Blackley: It is so hard for me to judge what others are doing on their estimates. It depends on the life, a variety of factors. So, I can’t even hazard a guess when it comes to commercial just because the portfolios are pretty different. So, I really honestly don’t have an answer to you on that one.
Jeff Norris: Next question, please.
Operator: And your next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
Rick Shane: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think we would all agree that a $100 loan balance on January 1 after the holidays would have a different repaying behavior than a $100 loan balance on May 1 after tax refunds are distributed. I realize from a CECL perspective you are supposed to take lifetime loss assumptions on both. But I am trying to understand how does the practical difference in terms of that near-term repayment behavior impact your lifetime loss reserve? And said slightly differently, is 5% growth in December the same as 5% growth in June?
Scott Blackley: Rick, I would just say that seasonal growth and transactors we look at those, we look at the likelihood of revolving we use historical empirical data about how quickly those get paid down. They don’t tend to have large lifetime allowances and in general I would say those aren’t really a factor that’s driving the multiples that we disclosed.
Rick Shane: Got it. So as a follow-up to that, we wouldn’t necessarily expect to see that same seasonality, because you are able to factor in, in the short-term the repayment behaviors?
Scott Blackley: Yes, broadly speaking, all else equal, I think that’s true.
Jeff Norris: Next question please.
Operator: And your next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.
Don Fandetti: Yes, Rich, there has been a lot of talk in the banking and payments industry about B2B and Capital One is a top three small business card issuer. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic there and what your thoughts are in terms of growth and is that growing faster than your consumer business?
Richard Fairbank: So our small business, we don’t break that out separately. As we are in the consumer side, one of the top players in the lead table in that particular space AmEx is way north of the rest of us unlike the shorter distance between competitors on the consumer side, but that business is a business that is a simple extrapolation – a simple transfer of a consumer approach or a lift and shift of a commercial approach ends up being a suboptimal thing. And the traction and success we have gotten in the small business space comes from really working backwards from the customer and the customer needs over a very, very long period of time. And so a lot of the underlying dynamics are the same in that business in terms of the shift in payments, the reduction in cash and checks and so on. But what I would leave you with is like our some of the other investments we have made at Capital One, this is many years kind of in the making and we are continuing to generate successful growth there. The one thing I would say is that on both the consumer side and certainly the small business and the commercial side, the change that is going on in payments is breathtaking. I think it’s really at the vortex of technology change in all of banking and that’s partly because the digitization of transactions is a very natural place to go, but it’s also one of the places that is not regulated or it’s very lightly regulated. And furthermore it is the place where many tech companies who really don’t want to be carrying around bank holding company badges and things like that focused on how they can try to win on the front end of banking and leave a lot of the back end of banking to the banks. So I am excited by the opportunity on the business side as well as the consumer side, but I’m certainly struck by the breathtaking rate of change. And I think for every player in the business, there is a real imperative to come up with a strategy and work backwards from where the world is going instead of forward from where we are.
Jeff Norris: Do you have a follow-up, Don?
Don Fandetti: Nope, I am all set.
Jeff Norris: Next question please.
Operator: Next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies.
John Hecht: Afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just not looking for guidance, but just thinking conceptually long-term, it would seem logical that you could do more digital customer aggregation with the digital bank in place. Was that – is it fair to think that customer acquisition costs, the costs tied to physical mailings and so forth may be more efficient going forward?
Richard Fairbank: Wait, I want to make sure, John, could you explain a little bit more of your question again?
John Hecht: It’s just you guys have invested a lot more to digital banking platform and it’s clear to us that as a user of your website you can do more online. And so the question is given that your consumers can do more online, are there cross-selling opportunities, are there other opportunities to reduce your customer acquisition costs for a specific product?
Richard Fairbank: Yes. So from the – interestingly from the founding notion of this company, one of the founding notions was that marketing is going to be reinvented by the technology and information revolution. And so, way back with old fashion direct mail, we set out to build the business and we also didn’t have – it was by being very small, we didn’t have much of a cross-sell opportunity. So much of the heritage of the company for a long period of time was focused on the origination of business. And one of the great prizes that awaited us over time was to have a scale franchise and there are two parts to that. One is to really be large, but the other is to be a franchise. And if you overlay the whole digital revolution on that, I want to redouble your point that I think the opportunity that awaits the companies who bring three things to the table is extraordinary. One is the table stake is you really need to be large and however important scale was in the past, it is more important everyday and I believe it was very important in the past. The second thing that one needs to bring to the table is great digital capability and that’s not just in terms of nice apps and that kind of thing, but also the information based capabilities which increasingly are very benefited by real-time big data and the use of machine learning. So there is a great opportunity there. That’s the second leg of the stool if you will, but I really, really, what we believe at the outset and what we certainly live every day is there is a third leg of the stool and that is that you have to have a loyal customer franchise. Just having eyeballs lying around just having a large customer base, it’s nice, but the nonlinear things that happen when there is a deep and loyal franchise is a great thing. If you look at the essence of Capital One strategy over all of these years, we started with nothing and have spent years and years in the quest for scale. Secondly, we have started with an information-based strategy many years ago and really – and that was again pre-Internet and all of that, but where we have come over time the whole tech transformation driving toward great digital capability and real-time machine learning big data capability. And then finally and maybe of all of them this is the hardest one to build is really building that loyal customer franchise, which is all about a great customer experience, products that people can rely on, a customer relationship that to tell your friends about and ultimately a brand that stands out. And I appreciate your question because that has been three legs of the strategy for many, many years and I think the growing traction that we are having on a lot of fronts, including on the financial side is a product of that opportunity. And I think there is a lot more upside from here.
Jeff Norris: Next question please.
Operator: And your next question will come from Brian Hogan with William Blair.
Brian Hogan: Good afternoon. Thanks. First question is on the competition and your views on the Applecart and the potential pressure could come from that large competitor in there, growth has been pretty dramatic in the first year or so? And then a follow-up on that is actually potential competition from like the challenger banks like Chime and Varo, N26 and others. Are you seeing any customer losses from those?
Richard Fairbank: Right. So, Brian your question is about competition. Our focus is really more on the sort of the tech side and the new innovation as opposed to just the – let me start with just a comment about competition in general in the card business and then let me pivot to some specific things. The credit card business, I think has – I think back to the founding of Capital One is I would say that Capital One is a very young company to most – compared to most of our bank competitors. They have been around for over 100 years. In Capital One’s case, it’s not an accident that we started with credit cards, because we had a belief way back then that credit cards structurally had a number of advantages that would allow them to have very good earnings power and also be absolutely at the tip of the spear of where the whole tech revolution and information revolution were taking it. It is funny over 25 years into this journey I am finding a lot of the same observations that we had before. And I think the credit card as a business is kind of standing out in these times relative to the earnings power of the business like this as well as some of the growth opportunities that it has. That said that insight is not lost on our competitors and this is a very competitive business. But because of the scale of the requirements in the business, it is – it’s a very consolidated business and I think most of the competition revolves around the top 10 players in the business. And I think the competition is intense, but I think it’s fundamentally rational. But the intent shows up in marketing intensity, rewards, offers, pricing and various things, but if we pull way up and I cross-calibrate to other parts of banking in which we play, this feels like we have the area with the highest opportunity and the most kind of rationale marketplace at the moment. Let me pivot to the tech marketplace. Often we are asked by investors about fin-techs and what about this startup and that startup and of course we keep an eye on that. I think the sort of elephant in the room is the gigantic tech companies and the sort of opportunities that they have. And so we have always had a lot of respect for that and frankly, our tech transformation is motivated in many ways by trying to emulate and learn from some of the best practices of those companies. It certainly has our attention. When Apple launches the Applecart, I think it was a really, really well done marketing campaign, which is universally what we have observed from Apple for many, many years. And we will keep an eye on that, but I would say that, that now adds to the list of impressive competitors and impressive offerings that we are up against. If we pivot to the challenger banks that are out there, so I am going to switch more to the deposit and banking side of the business, there are some really striking numbers that have been posted by companies that are trying to establish themselves in banking. We know from having spent a lot of years doing this and right now having a national banking strategy and you see us on television, it is a really hard thing to dislodge business from the established banks with great scale and local presence and so that all of us are working very hard on that. I have been struck by the numbers of account origination that are coming out of some of the challenger’s banks. The biggest question I have and I don’t know the answer is it’s just the question I have is how much activity level and true sustaining traction do they have. I am not saying they don’t. I think it’s something that is an important place to look, but we are inspired by some of the innovation our competitors are doing and it’s a reminder to all of us that if we really lean into a tech innovation, there is an opportunity to chip away at the extraordinary position that a few of the biggest banks in the U.S. have.
Jeff Norris: Next question please.
Operator: Your final question on the evening will come from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.
Eric Wasserstrom: Perfect. Thank you for fitting me in. Rich, in your commentary, you alluded to the fact that competition in the auto space intensified to some extent, can you just give us a little more insight on what you are referring to in what ways that manifested? And then I have one quick unrelated follow-up.
Richard Fairbank: Yes. So, the auto business has a relatively small number of very large players and I have often said, Eric that competition in auto is even more impactful than in the short-term than competition in card only because on the auto side you have a dealer in the middle of an auction. And when the dealer sees something from a particular lender, like a loser credit policy or a different pricing, the dealer can drive a significant amount of business in a way that just doesn’t happen in the one-to-one marketing that happens on the card side. So, it’s why almost every conversation that we have about auto and every time we celebrate a particular growth that we have, we always caution how big that factor is and how much that factor can create adverse selection if people are loosening their credit policies. So what we do is we invest heavily in technology in this business and we are absolutely every quarter we are out there to get whatever opportunity we can have consistent with our own standards and with a very, very watchful eye on the competition. In the last – over the last few years, there was a pullback of a couple of competitors that we took advantage of. Both of them have certainly returned and are pretty aggressive players in the space. And what we would describe to you is that the competition is increasing in the auto space. It’s nothing to wave red flags about, but it’s generally increasing and it’s a little bit unusual that at the same time we are saying competition is increasing that we are also saying our originations and even our book of business overall actually increasing. That is something that maybe a little bit anomalous. There is also something hard for us to tease out is the growing traction that we are getting by the very heavy investment we have in technology in the auto business that’s in terms of underwriting real time big data driven underwriting the creation of products for customers and dealers in this space that are very sophisticated tech-driven products that actually have real-time mass scoring of any car anywhere across the nation and the continued success that we have had in building deep dealer relationships. So, it’s a particularly kind of good quarter for Capital One, but I think the impression I would leave you is the competitive meter is rising and we will have to keep an eye on that. And the other very important thing that is probably the most important thing that we all should keep in mind in this business is that the auto business has been credit performance in the – I am speaking of the industry now has been benign for a long period of time. And at the top of the list is why that is so is what has happened, what is going on with used car prices, which have been stayed at a relatively high level for a long period of time. This is a collateral driven business. I also think when you have businesses where the collateral values have been high for a long period of time, one have to – we have to ask ourselves what collateral assumptions – collateral value assumptions are underwriters making across the industry. I will tell you what we do and we assume they are going down. I can’t speak for the whole industry, but I just want to put a caution that we have had good times for a long time in that business and collateral values have been an unusually strong ally and one forever.
Eric Wasserstrom: Thank you for that. And my very quick follow-up, Scott, is just on the tax rate it looks like it came in around 19% or so in this quarter. How should – was there anything special in this period, some true-ups or something and how should we think about the appropriate rate going forward?
Scott Blackley: Yes. Let me comment on more of the full year tax rate, because that’s what I would point you to the full year tax rate was about 19.5%. I would say that’s a reasonable baseline. It’s going to be plus or minus from there depending on the income levels evolutions in our credit, the businesses that generate tax credits, but nothing particularly large. We did have some discretes in the quarter which drove down the quarterly rate, but 19.5% is a good starting point for how you should think about the future.
Jeff Norris: Thanks, Scott and thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your interest in Capital One. Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer some follow-up questions that you might have. Have a great evening everybody.
Operator: Once again, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
