Now, this concludes my remarks. Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A section.
Operator: Yes, thank you. We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Jared Cohen with JM Cohen & Co. Please go ahead, Mr. Cohen. Your line is live.
Jared Cohen: I have two questions. One, just an accounting question. Can you tell us what your accounts receivable were the end of the quarter, because I think they always get inflated at this time, because you’ve financed your distributors? And then this is the peak of your season or its start the peak of your season or it’s in the third quarter? I was just confused.
Tao Li: The second quarter for our fiscal year normally is a slow season.
Jared Cohen: Right.
Tao Li: All our business cycle, all our peak quarters normally are the third quarter and the fourth quarter which is from January to June, the second half of our fiscal year.
Jared Cohen: Okay.
Tao Li: From your questions on your receivables, we just want to clarify and….
Jared Cohen: Okay.
Tao Li: So, for example, for instance for this year, for this fiscal year our revenue, our sales is around 6 million-ish for the quarter; and at the next quarter, we expect it will go about 70 million or 75 million-ish.
Jared Cohen: Okay.
Tao Li: Go back to your technical questions on the receivables. As of the quarter end the December 31, 2016, the net of allowance is at 120-ish or 125-ish around that nearly. It from the beginning of this reporting period, which was last year’s ending balance was 117 million, it’s at the same level, almost the same level.
Jared Cohen: Okay. And so what the collection days are about still around what 180 days you give your distributors to pay you or something like that?
Tao Li: There is no policy -- collection policy change or the booking policy change in our allowance or collection policy. And we are comfortable with what we have done and alternatively to better optimize the risk of profile in these collection activities. We integrated this into overall conformational growth strategy. Specifically, we initiate this transformation last year by developing by growing a new segment in addition to our old production segment of fertilizers. You’ve already learned and witnessed what we have done so far the strong last June, we acquired or controlled a first of batches of six companies. They are wholesale and retail, wholesale companies from different regions, and we’ve further penetrates this strategy with the second step on January 1st, we acquired a two additional companies and so far, right now we already have eight new wholesale companies and they start -- they already started to form this new sales strategy and they contributed to our revenue portfolio by adding 8, over 8 million for the -- excuse me for the quarter. And that does not include the newly acquired two companies from January the 1st, I mean you will see their value in a contribution from third quarters from third quarters report and we paid 4 million in cash and 6 million convertible notes with conversion price at a premium, $5 per share due in three years for the first batch of six companies last year and for this January on January the 1st we bought these two new companies we paid each of them 4 million cash and 6 million convertible notes I am sorry RMB. So, the total consideration average for each of them is roughly 2 million, $2 million. And now we have eight entities, eight new companies, they have their original network and we're integrating them together from different provinces and we'll add them, we'll continue to execute this strategy you'll see more and more companies in the wholesale segment will grow very rapidly very quickly and they will catch up with the production and from then on you will see a balance business portfolio with one hand on production, the other hand on wholesale and we're also in addition to the merger and acquisition business combination approach. We're bringing our credit facilities particularly those agricultural farms or countryside based lenders, innovative new internet based lenders and they will provide more credit facilities that will help us to mitigate or reduce the inherent risk in collection and in addition to just the pure numbers in the receivable balances. We believe the best approach, the effective remedy or the method is how you can collect them back while reducing the default risk and in the meantime grow the business and integrate or bond your clients or your customers. I hope this helps.
Jared Cohen: Yes, just more of a macro question. Can you give us an idea of the overall growth in terms of the agriculture business in China, in terms of particularly in terms of the number of provinces you're supplying now, because I think you've always had a limited number? Are you sort of supply more provinces now than you have before?
Tao Li: Let me answer your question this way. This is a macro economy question and the best answer to this question is actually available, is publically available from the central government publications this year. And every spring, the central government of China published, the central government report; and the number one report this year is centering, is focusing on the agriculture industry in China. The government proposed and analyzed the stuck hole of our industry and proposed that. The solution to our industry to optimize the supply and demand of agricultural product and agricultural materials is to optimize the compliment, the structure, the percentage of agriculture products that farmers who raise, that consumers eat and consume. So by solving the starving, starvation crises already for several decade from the past and the government is aiming to raise, to improve the nutrition balance, the nutrition quality of the food available for citizens, for people. And that require manufactures like us, including us who have --overall in a co-industry who have excess of capacities to further recycle some abundant and excessive capacities that can only be used to produce low quality agriculture material, we require them. The manufactures would require them, but in the mean time upgrade the technologies and our capabilities to produce better quality agriculture materials for our farmers to grow. For our farmers to raise better vegetables, better harvest, better grains, non-genetically modified and with better nutrients and with more proteins. So that’s the government's goal and that would lead naturally induce manufacturers and distributors, whole sellers to adjust that there business strategy to anticipate to get more used to the new policies, the new regulations. So that they can better help our, we can better help our farmers, help our customers well avoid a risk, avoid losses. So for example if a manufactures has been sonly producing low quality and low margin, pure chemical fertilizers would have cost historical damages to soil or pollutions et cetera, et cetera. This may not be a good environment to put such low technology companies to continue and to expand and to grow, rather to come as little pushing, the manufactures and also publishers and require in the in quarters. And the overseas companies to what was done to follow their regulations, provide good -- we need good stuff produce and so good stuff well protecting the environment. And if that’s how we interpret look at our industry and we wouldn’t be surprise that the full safety regulations from the tenants FDA will be more rigorous and decided from our fertilizer business. And as a hope group from our affiliates, shareholders and we're also establishing the online, offline the organic and high quality food platform. And overall, we've been in this industry for long time, and we're continuing win this and grow with this and help better, help our customer.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] All right, there are no more questions at the present time. So, I'd like to return the call to management for any closing comments.
Frank Wang: Thank you everyone for attending this earnings conference. And thank you very much for your time and we hope to see you in the future.
Tao Li: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect."
