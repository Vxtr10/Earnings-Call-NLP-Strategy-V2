Operator, we’re now prepared for the questions from our audience. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question will come from Jared Cohen of JM Cohen & Co. Please go ahead.
Jared Cohen: Yes. Just a few questions, first, financial question, I noticed your cash went down sequentially about $9 million. Can you discuss that, whether that’s because you paid down debt or for some other reason?
Ken Ren: Hey, Jared, how are you?
Jared Cohen: Good. Thank you.
Ken Ren: Nice to have you again in the conference.
Jared Cohen: Thank you.
Ken Ren: For your first question regarding true conditions, you specifically asked the changes in the cash balance. And I like to add a few remarks. And you’re pretty accurate on the fundamental reasons why such change occurred in cash. Specifically for the quarter, you may notice that we paid off our short-term loans and the - on operating activities, we generated regular cash and there is no significant investment activities, that means for the long-term of the cash used for the past period is for the purpose to pay off this short-term loans. Specifically paid off, yes, and from time to time on the needs and the interest rate market and we maintain good relationship with our commercial lenders. And this short-term loans historically and will be to reflect the better need for working capital.
Jared Cohen: Okay.
Ken Ren: Hope that’s…
Jared Cohen: Good. Second question is just - have you - you always used put on a press release before [announcing your names] [ph] in terms of adding new distributors quarter to quarter. I was wondering if you added any new distributors this past quarter in particular or so forth.
Ken Ren: As a matter of fact we did, we did add new distributors, and for the quarter and we added roughly 10 to 20 distributors [indiscernible].
Jared Cohen: Okay. And the last question, are you getting the benefit of now on the cost side of lower coal prices, because I think that’s one of the raw materials you use in terms of your products?
Ken Ren: The coal price - the coal is one of the raw materials that we use or procure for manufacturing process. And you may notice that the commodity market has been quite volatile for the past quarter. For instance, all these black commodities price went up and down significantly in the spot market as well as in future market in our nation. And we actively or cautiously had our positions. And in terms of utilizing these market environments or the price advantage, we will rather consider or plan to reduce our hedging cost instead of speculating the pricing trend for future contracts and pricing. And we foresee that or we anticipate, given the macro-economy situation, the commodity price market will be remaining volatile for the rest of the year. And we are closely monitoring this moment. If it stabilize and if we feel it’s comfortable to book for procure we will make that judgment based on our demands and contracts from our customers. And by the way also, I’d like to mention that the new President, who recently joined the firm - joined the company has been working or developing international markets, mostly at the company’s affiliate the 900LH.com platform for the past few years. And one of the reason and the advantage that we could have him with us is to explore or better utilize opportunities in right direction. And I think for this conference call, we have a very good opportunity in this time-window to ask questions to him, the new President, who is also Chairman Li and the CEO’s only son in this opportunity.
Jared Cohen: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And at this time there are no additional questions. I would like - we do have a question from [Rey Zerrie] [ph], a private investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you for taking my call. Could you guys tell me, what your plans are to return some value back to shareholders with the stock price trading in the low ones for a long-time now, and no dividends? Is there any thought of a cash share repurchases or cash dividends? Thank you very much.
Ken Ren: Well, thank you, Rey, for the question. If I remember correctly, three months ago, when we held last quarter’s conference call, similar question were asked and Chairman Li addressed the questions with his comments as, we appreciate these suggestions and your considerations and the board from time to time always put or have these options on the table and may execute such actions or activities timely if conditions permit. And in history we did issue dividend, and at that time we believe issuing that dividend is appropriate, is accurate, is needed. And we will continue to consider these options to better reward our shareholders to increase their values and that could include the dividend issuance that we accessed [ph] before or share buyback repurchase et cetera, et cetera. I just want to let you know, that the board has always been considering these actions and these courses.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And what are the - can I get what are the factors that would make you guys proceed in such a manner?
Ken Ren: I’d like to give an example, so for instance, we all noticed, if not, I’d like to remind or brief. Lately, many U.S. listed China-based companies had been traded with great volatilities for instance particularly those companies had announced going-private transactions or who have been in a process of conducting going-private transactions. And for instance, some companies, is at the final stage of concluding such transactions, however the information from the market or the update from the regulators caused turmoil and on euro are extraordinary trading activities for their company’s shares. And one of the particular reason is that for instance these going-private issuers - I’m sorry, this issuers who received going-private offers may have intention or intend a plan to relist in future in Shanghai Stock Market. And such market is under the regulation of the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission. And such commission indicated that they are studying the passes for the real estate. And yesterday or day before yesterday Bloomberg reported that, foreign currency conversion bodies or offices are examining the requests from the buyers’ group from the investors. And all these developments had added degrees of uncertainties to the sector. And such updates had been reflected or priced in these companies’ stock price, securities, future or vision. And what I’m saying is the factors from the regulators could impact the market perception. And we certainly will consider the impact from the changers of the policies, especially from these regulators. And that factor is one of the most important factors we met. And we always consider secondly, macro-economy, particularly in China. For example, the Chinese macro-economy have been slowing its growth path, growing pace. And the world entered the market adjusting the expectation on the Chinese economy’s growth. And such macro-economies or adjustments and the new norm in China also tend to be indicated or reflected in our company’s performance and financial results, which has been evidenced in our latest or the past reportings. One of the strategies we executed and are developing is to expand our international market to diversify our business by international - by developing our international market. So that for instance, if we have an international segment of business available and is growing, and the earnings we gain from such segment will be waived [ph] from the Chinese foreign currency converter regulation and we could better utilize such earnings resources to assist, to facilitate some actions we couldn’t have exercised, if such foreign earned or internationally earned earnings have not been or would not available. And I just want to give you an example to let you know that there are numerous factors that put the board and the management in a position for us to consider to incorporate their impacts, when we are going to plan for some favorable or some actions or some activities or corporate strategies. You ask or we may plan to, and on the other hand as like Mr. Li commented from the last conference call, Chairman Li commented from last conference call, in the near future, he promised, he assured you that you will hear from us on our activities, our actions. For instance, like in the last quarter earning conference call you didn’t expect that, we’re going to appoint a new president and we did. And he is available at this conference call and he’s very enthusiastic and full of energy, very young, Mark Zuckerberg from ‘80s had founded Facebook when he was only 20-years-old.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. So - okay, that helps. And so what are the prospects for international growth in the next year or so?
Ken Ren: Why don’t I let our President address you these questions. Hold on.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Zhuoyu Li: Hi, Rey?
Unidentified Analyst: Hi.
Zhuoyu Li: Hello, please stay on the line.
Unidentified Analyst: I’m here. Thank you.
Zhuoyu Li: So basically, I just came back from New Zealand where I went to university. And coming to this company of my father’s was really exciting for me, so I’d like to talk to you about our future plan for the international market. So, first of all, we are now negotiating with several different parties with regarding to be exporting of our fertilizers. First, a couple of years ago we entered in - we have become a global partner with - what was the company - we went to - we became the global partner with Nestle in Yunnan province of China. And after years of cooperation, we have been looking at other parts of the world where they grow coffee beans, that’s one. And currently, we have been developing and - we have been researching and developing our connections in the New Zealand agriculture industry. Last couple of years we have been approaching the authorities with regarding to being able to export our fertilizers to New Zealand. And now we are handling the - we are actually in the process of getting the products registered and find distributors over there. And at the same time in South America, we have been negotiating with the government for quite some time regarding - about growing rice over there. So basically they will promote our product, selling to the farmers. And farmers will be subsidized by the government in some way to continue their activity, so basically, that three are major activities or actions that we’re undertaking at this stage about the global market. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: And do you have any projection on what you expect as far as additional revenues in the next year or is it too early?
Ken Ren: Hey, Rey, I can address this question for you. Such information from the international market, we may reflect, we may incorporate that for the next of fiscal year. But for this quarter we won’t comment the projection for that particular segment.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Okay.
Ken Ren: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you very much.
Zhuoyu Li: Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Li for closing remarks.
Zhuoyu Li: Thank you very much, operator. And lastly, I wanted to thank you everyone for attending to this meeting. And thank you very much for your time. See you in the next conference call. Thank you.
