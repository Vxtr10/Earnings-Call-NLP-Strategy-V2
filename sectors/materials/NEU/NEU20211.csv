"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your NewMarket Corporation Conference Call and Webcast to Review First Quarter 2021 Financial Results. All lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Brian Paliotti. Sir, the floor is yours.
Brian Paliotti: Thank you, Melinda, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call may be forward-looking. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are contained in our earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K. During this call, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measure included in our earnings release. The earnings release, which can be found on our website, includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure. We filed our 10-Q this morning. It contain significantly more details on the operations and performance of our company. Please take time to review it.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.
Operator:
