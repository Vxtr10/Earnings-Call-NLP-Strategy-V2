"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NewMarket Corporation Conference Call and Webcast to review Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results.  At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Brian Paliotti. Sir, the floor is yours.
Brian Paliotti: Thank you, Dagma. And thanks to everyone for joining me this afternoon. As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call may be forward-looking. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are contained in our earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K. During this call, I may also discuss the non-GAAP financial measure included in our earnings release. The earnings release, which can be found on our website, includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure. We filed our 10-Q this morning. It contains significantly more details on the operations and performance of our company. Please take time to review it. I will also be referring to the data that was included in last night's earnings release.
