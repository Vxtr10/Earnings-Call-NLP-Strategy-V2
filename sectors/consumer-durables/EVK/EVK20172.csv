During the second quarter, we pivot our focus on developing retail business through our multi-brand strategy and store network optimization initiative while improving our wholesale businesses by upgrading customer portfolio.

Total sales for the second quarter of 2017 were $89.8 million, a decrease of 1.1% from $80.7 million in second quarter of 2016.

Sales for the company’s branded fashion apparel retail division increased by 9.1% to $46.8 million for second quarter of 2017 compared with $42.9 million for second quarter of 2016.

With out steady and strategic steps we are taking now, we are ready to capture the opportunities when the market conditions pick up. This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Thank you. Hi, operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to John Shehe as a private investor.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello, everybody. Thank you for the detailed presentation and thank you for taking my call. First, I would like to ask, can you share some comments on your sell-through rates for 2017 collections and current inventory levels?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: As a retail business, we attach importance to the inventory control. That is the thing we are always doing. Thank you.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: We attach the importance to the inventory control in the three aspects as following. One is that we shortened our development period, that is to say we develop our products in comparatively shorter period. And secondly, we bettered operating activities. And the third one is that -- that is to say we have the quick response activities. If good sales were well, we will do it quickly. And if the sale is not so good, we will abandon it. At last spring -- from last spring, we increased our sales by 2.91 million pieces. Last year, we had [2,206,000] pieces. And consumption rate, we increased 3 percentage points. 2.9 million pieces. Actually, it’s 2.9 million pieces. Last year, it’s 2.2 million. The sell-through rate increased [indiscernible] point. This time we have added 2.2 million pieces again. Last year, the number was 1.58 million pieces. We expect our sell-through rate should be 81% for this year. That is referring to the spring and summer periods. We expect that the rate will be 84% to 85% this year. That is to say, compared with last year, the order increased by 70,000 pieces and the sell-through rate increased by 3 percentage. That is the result of our effort in this last two years, and so far we have established our new model of development. If the environment remains the same, we hope that we can achieve a better result with this new development and operation model.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for that detailed information. Those numbers sounds very promising. And my next question, can you share some details about the performance and growth of your new brands?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: Our three new brands have developed with the development of the number increased of ourselves. That is totally within our expectations. For example, either one of the brand increased its number of shops one time. This will brand our all -- in the relatively shorter history. And the important approach we are taking now is that to investigate about the market preferences and demand with the goal of long-term sustainable development. That is to say we are now adjusting our design, fashion style to meet the market preference and to meet the customers’ final demand. That is the road every new brand should take. I’m now to the preparation works for the developments of these new brands in the next -- and again, next year.
Operator: We will take our next question from Peter Halesworth with Heng Ren.
Peter Halesworth: Hi, thank you. Well done on the margin improvement. It looks like your hard work in management is paying off. My first question, if you could speak about the decline in wholesale, what is the driver of that? And also, what are the gross margins in your wholesale business relative to your retail? That’s my first question.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: The so-called decrease of wholesale sales is mainly referring to the Chinese market, and the main reason is that the credit of some wholesale business in Chinese Mainland is not so good. So we are now in the process of adjusting the portfolio of our business partner. In contrary, the response in Australia and European market is comparatively better than in Chinese Mainland. To answer your second question that is about margin of wholesale and retails business and what is the difference between the two? I can only say to you that calculating calibers of these two are different. Mainly, the calculating methods are different for the two. For example, the payment -- payroll of the employees and some other expenses included in the calculation of retail, but in the wholesale business they are not included. And there are, of course, other elements and reasons. But in regard to the comparativeness of the two, I think both of them have different advantages and disadvantages. Regarding the retail business, I always attach our attention to the same-store sale and inventory control. That is the two important factors I always pay attention to. And if we have very good control over these two points, I believe this retail business will have a very good development. As of the wholesale business, I pay attention to the collectives and margin control and some other things different than the retail business.
Peter Halesworth: Thank you. If I may follow-up regarding the retail business and the selling expenses, it looked considerably higher and I understand that’s driven by the remodeling and the marketing. When we do we expect that to start to stabilize and not to see such high increases in selling expenses.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: As of the remodeling of shops -- in the store, in-store aspect, the period is generally 10 months and all the expenses will be consumed within this period, that is to say 10 months. And in big shops, this period should be much longer, that is to say approximately two years. But I believe, in the next year, that is 2018, all the expenses of remodeling will be -- get to a smooth line, and that is to stabilized.
Peter Halesworth: Okay, thank you. And then just a couple of final questions. On the fashion apparel retail, what percentage of those sales or how much is online? You listed $46.8 million for fashion apparel retail in the quarter, over in the quarter, what -- how much of that was online? And then secondly, what are your key performance indicators for this year relative to sales and margins? And then finally, if you can just remind us what the advance [indiscernible] related party of $6.4 million, what was that for? Thank you.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: E-commerce accounted for 4% to 5% of our retail business. Unit sales amount -- and the through sale, these three are the main indicators of the margin of the retail. Sales amounted to store. These are the main -- and the sales will raise. These are the main indicator of the retail business model. Are you clear with our answer?
Peter Halesworth: Regarding your third quarter of $6.4 million related party transaction, can you provide more details of this question?
Jiansong Wang: It’s in the balance sheet as a related party, maybe alone, or at least as we say for the transaction.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: With regards to your question, that is the guarantee amount resulted from the guarantee business of our related third party. Are you clear with the answer?
Peter Halesworth: Yes, so basically you are backing -- what is the related party?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: [Foreign Language] That is the Chinese pronunciation. Literally Ever-Glory.
Peter Halesworth: And what do they do and what was the purpose of the backing? What do they need backing for?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: So on the contrary, Jiansong already provided backup of us. Because our company is the newly listed companies, so the bank wouldn’t confirm our credibility. So with some backup or guarantee, we can get the loans from the banks. That is the truth. Do you understand?
Peter Halesworth: I do. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take a follow up now from John Shehe.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello, everybody. Thank you for taking my follow-up. I’m sorry, I lost the connection before. I would like to ask, do you have any new e-commerce marketing strategies that you can describe for us?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: We are always effort to increase the categories, kind and accounting in our wholesale. We are doing our effort to better the image of offline and online business. And in order to increase the rate of online sales, we will do our special efforts to increase categories, kind – of the product, which has good sales online. Of course, we will do some strategies to promote our online sales. We have several aspects, such as: video life streaming, Internet celebrity and touching exclusively in online shops, to name just a few.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for those details. And as my final question, Mr. Kang, what do your company’s your company’s strength that give such the opportunity to succeed in what is a very competitive retail market in China?
Yihua Kang: [indiscernible] The Ever-Glory is from originally wholesale business. The Ever-Glory retail from originally in our wholesale [indiscernible] We are doing something the other suppliers or brands are not doing. We have our specialties. [Technical Difficulty]
Wilson Bow: Hey, Debbie, could you please dial back to Mr. Kang?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: As we have grown originally from a wholesale business, we have learned to be able to do the quick response and we have learned a lot from the foreign brand variances, and these are the two main points that we have the advantage and capability to win in the world market at present.
Unidentified Analyst: That’s very helpful. Thank you very much. Thank you for the detailed answers to all of the questions.
Wilson Bow: Thank you for your questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session, and I’ll turn it back to management for closing remarks.
Yihua Kang: Thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you very much. We look forward to talking with you in the next quarter. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact our IR department or TPG IR. Thanks. Good bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect."
