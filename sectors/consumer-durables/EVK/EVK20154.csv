This concludes my prepared remarks for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll move to our first question from [Jon Sheehan], a private investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello, everybody. Thank you for taking my call. Congratulations on the strong results and thank you for the detailed management comments. First, I’d like to ask about the performance of your new brands, how many stores do you have over each brand and are the brands profitable right now? Or do they need to grow more before they make a contribution?
Wilson Bow: Let me translate. So in 2014, we introduced two brands, one is Sea To Sky, another is Velwin. For Sea To Sky, we have now around 70 stores around China and for Velwin, it’s also around 70 stores. For other stores, the single store profit is performing very well but we are still in the stage of initial investments. So if we [indiscernible] the operating expenses, some stores are still now profitable. But we are still working on it, it’s still at the initial investment stage. And in 2015, we introduced our brand, idole. We now have around 28 stores around China and for other new brand we introduced to the market, we still stick to our multi-branded strategy we hope to clear two different customer needs. Hope that answers your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. That’s a good answer. Then can I ask, do you feel that 2016 will also be a difficult year in the market or what are your expectations for general market conditions in 2016?
Wilson Bow: So the translation is, in 2016 I agree that both in China and internationally, the market situation will be still tough. However, it also provides us enough opportunities especially since we have introduced the new brands you can provide us with additional opportunities. Traditionally in China it is all about competition in pricing, but I think by our distinguished brands we are able to bring new values to our customers.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. And can I ask, do you have a VIP loyalty program for your best customers and how is it going?
Yihua Kang: So, yes we do have that. In the second year of last year, we introduced the point system for our brands. So, our customers can use their points to transfer to different products or things.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. And my last question is, I’m impressed with all of the achievements of the company, do you have any expectation to take some action that would share the success of the company with your investors such as payment of the dividends?
Yihua Kang: So, we haven’t raised the money since we go public and for all these years we have been supporting our development through cash flow from operations. So, we will continue to improve our profitability and use that to our operation.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. That’s all my questions. Thank you for the detailed information and detailed answers.
Yihua Kang: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have no further telephone questions at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Yihua Kang: Okay, thank you ladies and gentlemen for attending Ever-Glory’s fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call. We are looking forward to talking with you next quarter. If you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to contact our investor relations department or the [EG] Group. Good bye. Thank you.
