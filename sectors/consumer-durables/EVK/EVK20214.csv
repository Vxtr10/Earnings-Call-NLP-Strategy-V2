As of December 31, 2021, we operated a nationwide network of 880 stores compared with 936 stores as of December 31, 2020. During 2021, we operated -- we celebrated with the spokesperson of La go go. The effect of celebrating will enhance our brand influence. While we still see stronger demand for the products at our retail stores, we continue to see opportunities in the e-commerce area, viable platforms such as our La go go stores on Tmall and Dangdang.com are used as a strategic and effective way for us to drive customer engagement, encourage cross-channel shopping, reduce out-of-season inventory and created a unique and differentiated customer experience to grow our loyal customer base. The company's wholesale business is still affected by COVID-19 and the pressure of the economic downturn. We will actively respond to the changes in the internal economic environment. As for our wholesale business, the company has enhanced its extensive product development and supply chain management enterprise as well as network of high-quality, reliable and cost efficient sourcing channels and manufacturers. In addition, our market research center provides our wholesale customers with evidence research and notice  in the areas, including brand positioning, fashion trends, new material development and new site design.
