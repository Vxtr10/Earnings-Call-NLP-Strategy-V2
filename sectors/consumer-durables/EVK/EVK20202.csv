Jason Wang: Thank you. Good morning to those in the U.S. and good evening to those participants in Asia. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The sales for the second quarter of 2020 decreased both in our retail business and wholesale business. This decrease was mainly due to the pressure of the economic downturn and the outbreak of COVID-19. The outbreak in China has resulted in the reduction of customer traffic and the temporary closures of shopping malls as mandated by the provincial governments in various provinces of China from late January to March, which has adversely affected the company in the retail business, with a decline in sales since February 2020. The company's total business is also significantly affected as the company is facing a sharp decline in its order quality since the spread of COVID-19 around the world. We are actively respond to the changes in the external economic environment. During the second quarter, we maintained our forecast on developing the retail business through our multi-brand strategy and the store network optimization initiative, while improving our wholesale business by upgrading our customer portfolio and enhancing our account receivables.

Our inventory management strategy continually improved the balance between inventory turnover and our diligent cost control measures further strengthening the profitability of our business in order to create more visible and accessible locations. We have remodeled and relocated nine stores during the second quarter of 2020. As of June 30, 2020 we operated a nationwide network of 935 stores compared with 1,235 stores as of June 30, 2019. While we still see strong demand for our products at our retail stores, we continue to see opportunities in the e-commerce areas. Mobile platforms, such as our La go go stores on Tmall and the Dangdang are used as a strategic and effective way for us to drive customer engagement. Encourage cross-channel shopping, reduce out-of-season inventory and create a unique and differentiated customer experience to grow our loyal customer base. As the wholesale business, the company has enhanced our extensive product development and the supply chain management expertise as well as network of high quality, reliable and cost efficient sourcing channels and manufacturing. In addition, our market research center provides our wholesale customers with in-depth research and analysis in the areas, including brand positioning, fashion trends, new material development, and new style design. Going forward, we still continue to focus on enhancing our product development capabilities and optimizing the customer base with our long-term vision of being a leading supply chain solution provider for mid-to-high and apparel brands both in Mainland China and the worldwide. The company’s results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of its control such as the impact of health and safety concerns from the outbreak of COVID-19.
