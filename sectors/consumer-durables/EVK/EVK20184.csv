Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. We are very pleased that we announced the 2018 full year results with a 14.9% year-over-year increase in wholesale business and 2% year-over-year increase in retail sales. Notably, we achieved year-over-year improvement in gross profit of 15.7% for our wholesale business, as well as 6% for our retail business. On retail side, our brand continues to attract new customers and retain existing customers by focusing on design, quality and value. Our inventory management strategy continued to improve the balance between inventory hangover and sales growth. And our segment cost control measures further strengthened the profitability of our business. All of our efforts have contributed to the solid results for the past year. In order to provide more better access to location, we remodeled or relocated 250 stores in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we operated a nationwide network of 1,381 stores compared with 1,400 stores as of December 31, 2017. While we still see strong demand for our product at our retail stores, we continue to see opportunities in the e-commerce area. Mobile platforms such as our La go go stores on Dang mall and JD.com are used as strategy, an effective way for us to drive customer engagement. We encourage broad channel shopping to reduce our facing inventory and create a unique and disciplined customer experience to grow our loyal customer base. Looking at our wholesale business, although revenue remained relatively flat for 2018 compared with 2017, the overall market conditions in many of our key global markets remained challenging. However, weâ€™re excitedly encouraged by sales results from Japan, Mainland China, United Kingdom and United States, which reported a year-over-year increase of 115.7%, [75.6%], 24.5% and 22.5% respectively for 2018. Looking ahead, we are excited with where we invest in the plan and are emerging, and focued on operational excellence and efficiency to further enhance our position in China's ladies apparel market and wholesale industry. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Wang, who will provide details of our financial results for you. Thank you.
