Jiansong Wang: Thank you, Wilson. Good morning to those in the U.S. and good evening to those participants in Asia. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are very pleased to announce the 2021 second quarter results with 20.9% quarter-on-quarter increase in total sales. Notably, we achieved quarter-on-quarter improvement in gross margin of 46.7% for our retail business. But our social business decreased 17.5% in gross effect compared with three-months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was mainly due to raw material price and higher offset production costs. On retail side, our brands continue to attract new customers and retain existing customers by focusing on design, quality, and value. Our inventory management strategy continually improved the balance between inventory turnover and our diligent cost control measures further strengthened the profitability of our business. We operated 52 stores and closed 57 stores in the first half year of 2021. As of June 30, 2021 we operated a nationwide network of 931 stores compared with 935 stores as of June 30, 2020. During 2021, we operated with a separate feasibility as proposal  of La Go Go, the effect of the feasibility will enhance our broadened growth. While we still see strong demand for our products at our retail stores, we continue to see opportunities in the e-commerce areas. Mobile platforms, such as our La Go Go stores on Tmall and Dangdang.com are used as a strategic and effective way for us to drive customer engagement, encourage cross-channel shopping, reduce out-of-season inventory and create a unique and differentiated customer experience to grow our loyal customer base. The company's wholesale business is still affected by COVID-19 and the pressure of the economic downturn, where we actively respond to the changes in the internal economic environment. As for our wholesale business, the company has enhanced it's intensive product development and supply chain management expertise as well as network of high-quality, reliable and cost efficient sourcing channels and manufacturers. In addition, our market research center provides our wholesale customers with in-depth research and analysis in areas including brand positioning, fashion trends, new material development, and new style designs. Going forward we will continue to focus on enhancing our product development capabilities and optimizing the customer base with our long-term vision of being a leading by supply chain solution provider for mid-to-high and apparel brand, both in Mainland China and worldwide.

Sales for the company's wholesale division increased by 19.9% to $26.4 million for the second quarter of 2021, compared with $22 million for the second quarter of 2020.
