Jiansong Wang: Thank you, Wilson. Good morning to those in the U.S. and good evening to those participant in Asia. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. During the second quarter, we maintained our focus on developing retail business through our multi-brand strategy and store network optimization initiative, while improving our wholesale business by upgrading customer portfolio. Notably, we achieved year-over-year improvement in gross margins for both of our retail and wholesale business, as well as a year-over-year revenue increase of 17.6% for our wholesale business. Retail side, our four retail brands have delivered satisfying sales for the 2018 spring/summer collections in La go [ph] which focus on innovative distinctive product designs that tend for exceptional fine [ph] quality and value. Our store network optimization efforts and e-commerce initiatives also helped to improve retail sales n enhance customer business. Going forward we will continue to optimize our operations, so the positive trends can continue. We remodelled or relocated 69 stores during the second quarter and remain on track to relocated or remodel 200 to 300 stores in 2018. As of June 30, 2018 we updated a nationwide network of 1,417, compared with 1,362 stores as of June 30, 2018. We currently had also played an important role in our overall retail changes. I wanted to elaborate a little bit more on this point. For example the number of new customers that come in through our retail store or same-store has constant growth and those platforms have also brought a lot of cross channel spending opportunities at our offline stores. We believe we will have more opportunities in the e-commerce area and we will be able to better understand customers shopping heavier and fashion taste, which in turn will enable us to acquire new customers and retail service our existing customers. Looking at our wholesale business, we maintained focus on upgrading customer portfolio to reduce credit risk and improve margin in the light of weak micro environment. Our wholesale gross margin continued to improve on a year-over-year basis. Going forward, we'll implement a stricter client evaluation system and remain diligent in account receivables collection. We believe the enduring strength of our wholesale business will support its long-term profitability. This concludes Mr. Kang’s comments.
