Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Shaun [indiscernible] Private Investor.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello. I think that's me, congratulations on the great results and thank you for the presentation. Can you share some comments about your experience this year with the 11:11 shopping promotions in China?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language].
Wilson Bow: As you have seen the numbers posted on the website, the increase of Tmall was comparatively very large. Sales of La go go has similar numbers with Tmall platform. Of course, for us 11:11 is a festival that we both hate and love. The reason that we loved is because it can promote our sales and make better our product awareness. What we hate is that without this company we cannot make any sales. So, for such reasons we did not fully participated in the promotions of 11:11 in on the Tmall platform. We withhold our product to other channels. We have done a lot of work in visual and creative work on our computer systems. And that we increased the interaction with our customers. And we did some promotions around the taste of our customer for us for our product. Okay, thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. That's great detail. And can I also ask. Could you share some comments about the sell through rate for your fall collections?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]

Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: And we always do our efforts to have the balance of our sales volume and our inventory volume. We have maintained a delicate balance between the two factors.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: And such balance is very delicate and harder to achieve for our retail business.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: If we have not the enough inventory that will impact our sales volume.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
