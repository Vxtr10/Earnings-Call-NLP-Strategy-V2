Actually we have a good control of the inventory level and our inventory in the first quarter decreased by 38.7 from the same period last year. So far our sales were raised for our spring summer collections improved compared with the same period last year. The inventory level decreased this year compared with last year. The decrease rate was 38.7%. And we improved our sales rate for this yearâ€™s spring summer collection and the increased rate is comparatively very big. And I have always the past importance to the balance between inventory and the sales and it lead to much sales and we must be ensured on our inventory. And if our inventory is comparatively big, so that our sales will be effected in other way. So I have always been controlling the balance between the two factors. And we have this in the year half 2015 and 2016 and so this yearâ€™s effort, we are confident to have increased our ability in control of the balance and Iâ€™m very optimistic on this concern. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Excellent, thatâ€™s very good information. And can you comment on your level of promotions and discounting this year?

Jiansong Wang: Thanks a lot.
Operator: We will go next to [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. I have a question and then some follow up questions. First on the results, I thought they were promising in terms of margin improvement which you highlighted, I would like to know from the Chairman what we can expect in terms of strategy for improved top line growth. What is the strategy for this year and the future to improve that? And then I have a follow-up questions.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign language]
Wilson Bow: Regarding the wholesale and first of all we must up code our [indiscernible] shop sales and at the same time we must delete the shops which has not very good outcomes, that is two methods we are going to case. And we are going through some adjustment in our product development so we can promote our sales.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. And can I get some indication of what number of stores will be added in 2017 net of closing. What the CapEx budget is for 2017 and then I have a follow-up, thank you.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: And by the end of the this year the net increase of number of the shops will 1500. And as investment for one shop, there two factors. One is debt of the shop and another is inventory for new shop. And the total of these two factors will be totally about $100,000 for one shop.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And just to confirm the number. The total number of shops with that net increase at the end of 2017 is how much?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: Now let me clarify. The total number of the shops by the end of this year will be 1500. And net increase will be about 200. But that is to say that currently, we have 1300 shops.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you for clarifying. And also I think what I heard in the earlier discussions that there is a move to develop higher end product. And I'm wondering what is the motivation for that and would this also lead to an increase in need for the investment in real estate in order to get the proper locations for higher end products. I just want to make sure I understand it.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: Currently we have four self hold brands that is [indiscernible] and we attach importance and put emphasis on [indiscernible] is very promising, the second one is idle. And because these two brands are comparatively high-end brands so the decor and location of the shop will be confirming to these two factors. The promotion to do so is that we must make some differences between these two high-end brands and [indiscernible] the common brand and in later in the year we will do something to upgrade these two brands.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you for clarifying the high-end development is under existing brands thatâ€™s important thank you. And then just last two questions, one is on the depreciation of the renminbi over the past year, Iâ€™m wondering is that helping in terms of your sales in particular overseas and have you been focusing marketing efforts more there and also we have been hearing a lot in the U.S. about tightening of credit in China and I see that you receivables have come down which is important. Iâ€™m just wondering are you expecting any issues related to the tightening credit conditions in china. Thank you.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]

What type of percentage should we forecast in our earnings model?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
Wilson Bow: Regarding the mandate increase of the salaries, this is just a truly effect but mainly we have instituted importance to the different brands. So we have recruited some new talents. This is the main factor for us to increase our total investment in salary.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay thank you and going forward what should we forecast in terms of the salary increases if any going forward for rest of this year and also 2018? What would be a range of expectations?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language]
