Now, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Jiansong Wang, to provide the details of our financial results.
Jiansong Wang: Thank you, Mr. Kang, and hello to everyone on the call. In 2015, despite continued price increases due to [indiscernible] we maintained the gross margin for wholesale business at same level compared with the year-ago period, while improving the gross margin for retail business by 110 basis points, due to the decrease of our cost. In the fourth quarter, we are pleased to record notable growth margin expansion of 510 and 320 basis points in our retail and wholesale business respectively. Now, I will walk through our financial results for the fourth quarter as a full year to 2015. Please note that all numbers discussed today are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. First, let me walk you through fourth quarter financial results. Total sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $110.4 million, a decrease of 14.5% from $129.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by a 21.2% decrease in our wholesale sales and 8.3% decrease in retail sales. Sales for the company's branded fashion apparel retail division decreased by 8.3% to $51.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $57 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due a decrease in same-store sales, excluding the impact of recent depreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Sales for the company's branded fashion apparels retail division decreased by 2.4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. The company had 1378 retail stores as of December 31, 2015 compared with 1159 retail stores as of December 31, 2015. Sales for the company's wholesale division decreased by 21.2% to $49 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $62.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Sheehy [ph] with Private Investor.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello everybody. Thank you for the detailed presentation, and thank you for taking my call. First, could you tell us the change in your revenues for the year in Chinese Yen before conversion to U.S. dollars?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language] Total sales for the full year of 2016 decreased 6.8% compared with the year of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a 9.1% decrease in retail sales, and a 4.3% decrease in wholesale sales. Excluding the impact of the depreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar, total sales for 2016 decreased 0.7% compared with 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a 3.1% decrease in retail sales, and a 2.0% decrease in wholesale sales.
Unidentified Analyst: That was very helpful. Thank you. And also you describe your wholesale results by country. Can you give us some background about how investors should interpret these numbers?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language] The company's sales in different countries are influenced by the macro economic condition of each country and foreign exchange factors, but influence is not absolute. Currently the company has nine export sales teams, and each is responsible for different regions and different clients. Each team is allowed clients in its responsible regions after the completion of client valuation to meet the company's growth margin requirements. Therefore, the sales growth in different regions are also subject to each team's business development ability, investment services, team performances, costs, seasonality, and the ability to optimize client base.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you, that's helpful. And can you tell us about your experience with brand extension in like home goods, lingerie, and anything else that you have tried?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language] The company has made efforts to upgrade the image of traditional apparel stores, and have introduced [indiscernible] lingerie, hired and home supplies consignment sales to some of our stores which increased the diversification of our store space. We have received positive feedbacks on these changes. Currently, the company does not have plans -- that's all. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. And then my last question, can you share some expectations for 2017 as far as the number of stores for each brand and your total retail gross margins?
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language] We expect to operate over 1,450 stores at the end of 2017. We don't currently provide detailed breakdown of the store members for each of our brands, but we will continue to optimize our store network in 2017.
Yihua Kang: [Foreign Language] The gross margin rate of our retail sales in 2016 was 43.1% and increase of 110 basis points compared with 2016. In the last two years, the company has maintained disciplined cost control and met our internal expectations. In 2017, we will focus on boosting sales and increasing same store sales while at the same time continue our cost control efforts. We're aimed to keep the gross margin at similar levels in 2017.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks again for your detailed management comments, and thanks for answering all my questions.
