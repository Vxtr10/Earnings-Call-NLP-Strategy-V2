As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without permission from the company.

Efraim Grinberg: Thank you, Rachel. Good morning, and welcome to Movado Group's first quarter conference call. This morning, I will review the highlights of the quarter and our strategic initiatives and then Sallie DeMarsili, will cover our financial results in greater detail. We will then be glad to answer any questions you might have. We had a very strong start to the year and are pleased with our financial and operational results. During the first quarter, we anniversary at the height of the pandemic closures. And although we still saw a significant closures during the quarter in Europe and Latin America, we delivered a 93.5% increase in sales to $134.8 million. Our adjusted gross margin percentage expanded 420 basis points to 55% versus 50.8% last year. And we delivered $14.1 million in adjusted operating profit versus an adjusted operating loss of $17.6 million last year. Our operating income represented a record for the first quarter of a year. Our balance sheet continued to strengthen with net cash of $177 million versus net cash of $105 million last year. Our US sales exceeded our plan, driven by strengthened Movado e-commerce and wholesale business, our Coach brand and our Movado company stores, with all three areas exceeding our pre-pandemics sales levels. Our US business increased to 131% versus last year and 10.8% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2020 or calendar 2019. Our international business grew 67.5% despite significant continued closures in Europe and Latin America. We are hopeful that these markets will continue to reopen during the second quarter as vaccinations begin to accelerate and case counts and hospitalizations drop. As a company we continue to focus on our strategy of expanding our digital footprint on our Web site, our customers’ Web site and our marketing initiatives, and driving product innovation while keeping a stringent focus on our expenses. As we look at our brands, we are very pleased with the performance of Movado. Over the last 18 months, we focused on delivering an increasingly aspirational message to our consumers, driving innovation in our products and drawing new customers to the brand. This strategy is proven to be effective with the success of our new Movado SE introduced last fall and our most recent introduction in our BOLD collection, Verso. During the quarter, we also introduce a collaboration with the world renowned photographer, Alexi Lubomirski, a limited edition highlighting Alexi's doorways to veganism, featuring our first vegan straps that received an excellent reception from consumers. We also saw a strong and growing demand from Movado Jewelry, which is only available on movado.com. During the first half of this year, we're supporting the Movado brand with cable television advertising, as well as social and digital marketing efforts.
Sallie DeMarsilis: Thank you, Efraim, and good morning, everyone. For today's call, I will review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and then I will provide an update on our outlook for the year. My comments today will focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the description of all of the special items included in our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 in our press release issued earlier today, which also includes a table for GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Our performance for the first quarter of this fiscal year exceeded our expectations and resulted in record operating profit. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, sales were $134.8 million as compared to $69.7 million last year, an increase of 93.5%. Strong consumer response to our brands and offerings, coupled with the beginning of the easings of restrictions that brick-and-mortar retail in certain geographies led to net sales increases across our segments of owned brands, licensed brands and company stores, as well as across certain geographies, most notably the United States. US net sales increased 130.9% and international net sales increased 67.5% as compared to the first quarter of last year. Total net sales decreased 8% as compared to the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2020 with 10.8% increase in the United States, offset by 20.8% decrease in international net sales. This reflects continued closure of retail stores in Europe and Latin America.
Operator:  Our first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Co.
Oliver Chen: The US performance was really impressive, particularly US wholesale. What are the factors that contributed to upside and do you see the momentum continuing? And how do you view the consumer environment and backdrop right now?
Efraim Grinberg: So you have a number of factors. One, I think, pretty much from the second quarter of last year, we began to see increased demand for watches as a category overall within the US wholesale channel, especially the department store channel, and we're now starting to see a resurgence in the chain jewelry channel as well. And that combined with I think the innovation and product that we've delivered across our brands and also you have a US consumer that is now pretty flushed in terms of their resources for discretionary spending, and I think all of those factors have contributed. We're optimistic that with the things that we're doing within our brands, we're going to continue to create the innovation and excitement for consumers to keep purchasing our products.
Oliver Chen: Efraim, what's the nature of product that's popular in terms of the reopening, whether that’d be price points or styles as people go out now?
Efraim Grinberg: We're actually seeing less price resistance and more interest in innovation and new designs. And that's why I've called out our Movado SE, which is an iconic watch that the company redesigned and reintroduced last year. In the second half that's doing extremely well. We're introducing a new Movado SE that starts at about $1,500 and goes up to $2,000 that we're very excited about. And then we introduced the new BOLD Verso that's done extremely well. So we continue to see that innovation and newness is really creating demand.
Oliver Chen: And Sallie, inventory versus sales, how should we think about that going forward? And also as we think about different inflation factors, labor and transport and others. Do you see that impacting your pricing, how might you manage that?
Sallie DeMarsilis: So we'll take it separately. So on the inventory level, we are going to be monitoring our purchases, but we do have, obviously, a nice top line sales number that we're forecasting. So we will be adjusting our purchases in line with those sales numbers, but obviously, purchasing as tightly as possible for the demand. So we're very happy with where we are right now in our inventory. Everything is current core product and we'll continue to manage that going forward. And as Efraim said, we're seeing high demand for our product. And so as far as -- what we're seeing is cost coming in, we are managing that as well with our supply chain, not seeing any major increases in what it's costing us to get our product or deliver it to where it needs to be.
Efraim Grinberg: And we had elevated our internal workforce in our warehouses about two years ago to a minimum of $15 an hour at that time. And so while there is demand for labor, we think we're in a pretty good position in terms of that but there's definitely some inflationary pressures in the marketplace. And I think there's also pricing opportunities in the marketplace as well. So we're in the process -- we have implemented some and we will be implementing others as well.
Oliver Chen: Congrats on your ESG report. Cowen believes many new customers are much more attuned to environmental and social issues. How do you think about your ESG priorities in the context of demand creation?
Efraim Grinberg: Well, I think across our brands, we have different initiatives on the ESG front, and from Tommy Hilfiger, where we put an emphasis on accessibility and product for people who have issues with being able to popular watch or put on a regular strap or bracelet. So we've enabled accessibility options on some of those products. In other areas, like movement we’re involved in the environment and in the ocean, because that's very close to to their home in California. And they'll be introducing actually a watch of recycled ocean plastics in the next month or two, and we participate also with 1% for the planet. And then in Movado, we were really excited by the reception we got to our pathways to veganism collection and in vegan straps in our most current introduction with Alexi on our Web site. So I think we're taking a number of initiatives and using social media and digital marketing to be able to communicate those initiatives with consumers and we're excited about those.
Oliver Chen: Our last question, as your digital innovation has been very strong, as stores reopen, what do you think happens to that growth rate and the interplay between the channels?
Efraim Grinberg: I think you'll see some balancing out of the growth of the e-commerce channel -- and especially, people are really welcoming the opportunity now as the weather gets better, masking requirements and -- vaccinations become more prevalent. Masking requirements become more acceptable. I think you're seeing a shift of a desire for people to go into stores. I think you're still going to see e-commerce as a growing area in the business and from our perspective, because people have become much more comfortable shopping that way as well. So you'll see really a true omni-channel performance. We continue to invest in areas for omnichannel development. So we'll be putting in a new point-of-sale system into our Movado company stores that's much more advanced than where we were in the past. So I think there are going to be continued opportunities to grow the omnichannel environment.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Mr. Efraim Grinberg for closing remarks.
Efraim Grinberg: Okay. I would like to thank -- first of all, I'd like to thank all of our employees for the great job that they have been doing throughout this pandemic. I'm hopeful that we are beginning to see a return to normalcy. And I would like to wish everybody in the United States a really happy holiday weekend. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day."
