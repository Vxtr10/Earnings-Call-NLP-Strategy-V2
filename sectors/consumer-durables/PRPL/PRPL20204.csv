"Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Purple Innovation Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. . It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brendon Frey from ICR. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin.
Brendon Frey: Thank you for joining Purple Innovation's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. A copy of our earnings press release is available on the Investor Relations section of Purple's website at www.purple.com. I would like to remind you that certain statements we will make in this presentation are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Purple's innovation judgment and analysis only as of today, and actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting the company's business.
Joseph Megibow: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call today is John Legg, our Chief Operating Officer; and Craig Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. We entered 2020 with a lot of momentum resulting from the many operational initiatives in manufacturing, distribution, marketing and omnichannel retailing that our amazing team successfully executed in 2019. We had a sound plan in place to build on our success and accelerate growth, which we outlined on our fourth quarter earnings call this time a year ago. Soon thereafter, our plan was interrupted by the outbreak of COVID-19 in the U.S. and the measures to help slow the spread of the virus, which significantly altered everyday life for most Americans and disrupted commerce across the country for many companies. 2020 proved to be a year like no other, as the global health pandemic created challenges for most businesses. I'm incredibly proud of how the Purple organization skillfully navigated volatile market conditions throughout the year and quickly adapted to a changing consumer behavior. Early in the outbreak, we leaned heavily into our digital expertise to capitalize on the accelerated shift to online buying, while nonessential brick-and-mortar retail, including a large portion of our wholesale channel, was shut down. Our business also received a boost from the increased spending on categories tied to the home during the pandemic. This was true for not only our mattresses, but created significant opportunity for our differentiated pillows and seat cushions as well.
Craig Phillips: Thanks, Joe. As Joe outlined, it was another strong quarter from both a revenue and adjusted profitability standpoint, even with some late December wholesale sales appearing to shift into January. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, net revenue was $173.9 million, up 39.9% compared to $124.3 million in the prior year period. The revenue increase was driven primarily by strong growth in mattresses in our DTC channel, along with higher demand for pillows, sheets and seat cushions.
Joseph Megibow: Thanks so much, Craig. We are very excited for 2021. Coming out of the incredible share gains we achieved last year, significant momentum and with the strongest balance sheet we've ever had, we are now able to appropriately invest in capacity, R&D and maturing our operations. The 2020 distorted profitability from pandemic-fueled mix shift to online sales, along with catch-up and new investment in 2021 does create gross margin and EBITDA pressure year-over-year, though that misses the point. We have continued to drive intrinsic improvements across the board as compared to our multiyear trends. And more importantly, this comes from the incredible hard work and diligence of our team in 2018 and 2019 as we've stabilized and built a foundation for scale. This proven execution ability allowed us to lean in and disproportionately capture opportunity last year and is now allowing us to invest in significant long-term growth. Having worked alongside the amazing Purple team for the last 2.5 years, I am confident in what they can accomplish and look forward to continuing to share our progress and success with customers and investors alike. We are just getting started. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: . The first question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.
Seth Basham: Congrats on a great year. My question is first thinking about the near term here, Joe. It seems like things slowed in the wholesale channel in December, but have since picked up. But it seems like your revenue growth guidance for the first quarter is still a little bit lighter to expectations. Are you seeing an overall deceleration in demand that's causing that?
Joseph Megibow: Seth, great to connect again. Yes, we're actually very pleased with our performance right now. I would say, as you indicated, that wholesale hasn't rebounded quite as quickly as we had anticipated many months ago, late Q4, a lot of the industry reporting on this. Wholesale, definitely it's converted, call it. Brick-and-mortar is definitely coming back, again, with the later waves of the pandemic not quite as quickly as some of us had hoped. That said, our wholesale demand has never been stronger against traffic patterns. Our partnerships remain very strong, and our DTC business continues to grow quite at healthy rates. So no, we are not seeing any indication of deceleration in demand. I just - we're just maturing the overall scale of the business.
Seth Basham: That's helpful. And just a follow-up on the wholesale channel and the outlook there. Do you still have many accounts that are on allocation? And when do you expect to have that supply to meet all the wholesale demand with your current partners?
Joseph Megibow: Yes. Right now, we are meeting all orders coming in, so we have no partners on allocation at this point. Again, we've been diligently building out our capacity, as you heard in the prepared remarks. We're in our strongest capacity position right now. And the pace that John Legg and his team are building out new Max Machines, new injection molding machines for our pillows and cushions. And with the addition of Atlanta, we have significantly better labor pool - better but larger labor pool to pull from where - this is the year we grow capacity faster than our demand is growing. And that's, again, given the prepared remarks that we just said, that's exactly what we've been trying to do.
Seth Basham: Got it. If I may, just to make sure I understand the wholesale outlook. When you think about your existing partners versus new partners you plan on signing up and the number of doors you plan on expanding into, I presume that the majority of the new doors that you're expanding into are with existing partners in 2021.
Joseph Megibow: Yes. Well, our preference is to support the partners we have, for sure, and we're in early days with some of our larger partners on building out our penetration. That said, there's a large market out there, and there are many ways for us to get the share we need. So we have the luxury of a few paths forward right now, but we continue to have very healthy relationship with our existing partners and anticipate meaningful expansion there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Bradley Thomas: And let me add my congratulations on a great on 2020. Joe, it seems like you have a lot of really exciting initiatives in the pipeline here to drive organic growth and market share gains. If I piece apart the guidance, I think you are implying that you all would be doing about 30% revenue growth, give or take, after 1Q through the balance of the year. As we think about piecing that apart, how are you thinking about the D2C growth versus the wholesale growth in those quarters?
Joseph Megibow: So our DTC business is certainly at the scale we're operating and maturing, but we still anticipate very healthy growth there. Part of this is supported by some very strong growth engines we have in DTC, one of which is the showrooms that we largely paused for 2020 given the general slowdown or outright shutdown in brick-and-mortar. We finally turned it back on in Q4 with 4 additional showrooms and, as we said in the prepared remarks, are anticipating 5 or more per quarter on average, which is the pace we've been signaling for quite some time. The other is our contact center, which we've spoken several times on. Our contact center continues to execute extremely well. It's driving double-digit percentages of our online business with higher conversion rate, higher average order value, higher units per transaction. I mean, in nearly every measure, putting associates on the phone with customers who are very focused on helping our customers out is a magical combination and is helping to fuel significant growth as well. And then we - finally, we have the new e-commerce platform that we did not launch last year as we deferred into early this year given all the short-term opportunity we found ourselves facing last year. But we've got an entirely new platform, a complete rebuild top to bottom, all new design and an entirely homegrown promotions engine. We looked at the market and didn't find any third-party options that could meet the approach and complexity that are needed to service our customer, and those become significant assets driving our growth as well.
Bradley Thomas: Got you. That's helpful. And if I could ask a question about - thinking about bridging the EBITDA guidance. When we think about '20 to '21, how should we think about the level of maybe onetime investments or step-up in investment and how much that's impacting EBITDA?
Joseph Megibow: Yes. Certainly, this is an investment year, although I would say a good portion of that is - it could really even be characterized as catch-up. We were able to capture organic growth and lean into arbitrage on marketing efficiencies and so forth last year that we were able to do a lot with a little. But our business has continued to grow dramatically, and there's a lot of investment into the core that I wouldn't call in advance of revenue, but really just catching up. If you look at some of our key metrics, the number of field salespeople we have per door that we support, for example, we are substantially under invested as compared to nearly any of our competitors. So some of it is just outright rightsizing the business. That said, we clearly - as I talk about things like the e-commerce initiatives, continuing to build out Atlanta, our showroom expansion and so forth, we are investing. Craig, if you want to jump in, I don't know if you can provide a little more specific guidance there.
Craig Phillips: Yes. I would say it's going to be across basically all the lines. So in cost of goods sold, it's going to be a combination of channel shift. It's going to include, as we still build out Atlanta and continue to add machines in marketing and selling, they're investments that we're making in content and building the brand. And then in G&A, as Joe talked about building the infrastructure and rightsizing. So there's going to be pressure on all the lines, and it's going to be a mixture, but there's tailwinds as well. So there's not one specific thing to point to. It's an investment year for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James Financial.
Bobby Griffin: I just want to dive into the fourth quarter a little bit and then ask a couple of questions about 2021 and beyond. But for the fourth quarter, when we spoke in November, what was the biggest delta versus the kind of revenue, I don't want to call it guidance, but soft guidance that was given in 3Q of having that growth rate compared to the growth rate in 4Q comparable to 3Q? Was it on the wholesale side? Was it on DTC? Like what slowed versus your expectations in November?
Joseph Megibow: Yes. Certainly, it was a little softer than we had hoped. It was largely led by wholesale. As we said in the prepared remarks, later in the quarter in terms of our sell in, we saw lighter buys than we had anticipated, which, later, as we looked at sell-through data and market data indicated a little more malaise in brick-and-mortar in the back half of December. Again, we have seen a catch-up on that in early Q1, which is what you would certainly hope to see, but wholesale was the biggest delta there. DTC performed well, as you see in our overall Q4 results. I think we were hoping - again, it really was driven in the back half of December. We were hoping for a little more, came in a little lighter than we had anticipated. But the other challenge, and we're clearly correcting that for this year, I mean, we did not give formal guidance for Q4. We gave sort of some directional hints, and I think some of the gap was just a lack of specificity in Q4. We were a lot closer to what we thought we would do internally. So this year, we definitely, as you're saying, are going to try to be much more transparent and communicative with what we see going on and anticipate keeping a much more open dialogue moving forward.
Bobby Griffin: Okay. That's helpful. And then for the wholesale aspect, I mean, is it more just customers had a little too much inventory or there was just moving parts around your retailers, other products? Because I'm just asking the context that while, of course, COVID obviously had an impact on the retail market, some of your peers that are majority wholesale did have pretty strong quarters in their wholesale business. So was there just some timing shifts there? Or are you getting enough visibility to see that there's not changes happening on the floor for the Purple products?
Joseph Megibow: Yes. So certainly, as compared to balance of year, Q4 was opening back up. So for those who leaned heavily into brick-and-mortar, Q4 was a very optimistic quarter. We just saw some very healthy buys early in the quarter that - and consider we were coming out of allocation, so I think we also had some of our wholesale partners trying to build their stores on our product when they could. So some very healthy inventory positions early in the quarter and, as a result of, I think, just burning that down. And the sell-through data shows pretty consistent sales volume. I just - I think they bought heavy early in the quarter, sold that down and then held back their rebuys until early this year.
Bobby Griffin: Okay. Two final questions. One is the removal of Max's Machine, does that put you for at least temporary until you get the other machines built up in more of a capacity constrained situation again? And then secondly, with you guys growing the company owned stores, the Purple showrooms, can you share any target economics or anything around those from an average box revenue standpoint or four wall profitability that you're aiming for since those are going to become a bigger part of the puzzle now?
Joseph Megibow: Yes. So certainly - so as to Max 1, I mean, the Max 1, which was built as a prototype, it's for - sorry, it was designed and built as we were sort of figuring it out. So I mean, it looks and performed differently than any of our other Max Machines. It's been at reduced capacity for a while anyway as we've continued to try to maintain it given that we now have Max 8 online and our Atlanta facility is operational. And what's hard to tease out with so many moving pieces is we continue to find leverage and operational efficiencies across all of our Max Machines. This has come up in commentary over the prior quarters. We have many, many initiatives in play that fundamentally improve the economics and yield of our Max Machines. We're still in early innings in our maturing of our operational capabilities. John Legg and his team has an amazing team of engineers that, as we learn month on month on how we could do these things better, are continuing to retrofit all of these machines with significant improvements. So we continue to get more yield and better economics out of the whole fleet of Max Machines. So combining that with improved labor, as we were labor challenged throughout of last year as well and the Atlanta facility being operational now, we are not seeing any pressure on our capacity. And again, as I said before, we are going to be growing capacity. Max 9 is nearly there. We'll have it up early next quarter, and 10 and 11 are right on track. We will be growing capacity faster than our organic demand is growing.
Bobby Griffin: Okay. And then the last one was just on the economics of the store units. Anything you can share as these are going to become a bigger part of the model now for the business?
Joseph Megibow: Yes. Sorry, I missed the second question there. Thank you. Yes. So we haven't disclosed specific targets yet, other than I think there are good benchmarks out there and our early read that we're at 9 showrooms, only 5 of which have been out there for about a year. So - and last year wasn't exactly a strong reference year on brick-and-mortar. But all of our early signals in our last 4 doors, which are an entirely new design and, just really, the team has done an incredible bringing our brand to life, the progress we've made on testing and maturing these is impressive, we anticipate that we will get similar economics to other benchmarks out there, which are very healthy. And the cost, these don't carry a lot of inventory, and the cost to build these out are fairly reasonable. And frankly, leases right now are very attractive. So we continue to see very strong economics and, call it, give or take, around 12-month ROIC on these things, some a little more, some of them are less, but really, really strong economics.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
Brian Nagel: So I want to ask a couple of quick ones to start, and I think these are follow-ups to some of the questions my colleagues asked. But - so first off, with regard to Q4, when you take into consideration kind of - it wasn't guidance, but some of the parameters you had given us when you report your third quarter results. If you look at - so really, what you reported today, revenue growth slowed - the rate of revenue growth slowed in Q4 from Q3. Can you help - so how much of that was just the mix shift to wholesale from DTC, recognizing basically the lower sales dollars you get from wholesale sale? In other words, I mean, maybe isolate it back down to like a unit sales type number.
Joseph Megibow: Yes, so certainly, mix shift, and we'll continue to see that as wholesale comes back. That distortion we saw of revenue through much of Q2 and a good chunk of Q3, as we were capturing more net revenue per unit with a much more DTC weighted mix, that did start to come back more toward, call it, normal or more forward-looking levels. So that does pull it down. On a unit level, we're still on track with expectations. I mean, we're at a point that we probably could have sold a little more, meaning we weren't inventory constrained. We didn't have our partners on allocation. And again, we were prepared to sell a little more into wholesale than actually were realized. But overall, in the unit level, it still remains, give or take, in line with where we thought we would be. It really is driven much more by the mix shift, which is more of what you're going to see as compared to Q2, Q3 throughout 2021.
Brian Nagel: Okay. That's helpful. Then with regard to Q1, so you mentioned in the prepared comments that on the wholesale side, the trends had improved in January, but the guidance you - the revenue growth guidance you outlined for Q1 still represents somewhat of a downshift from what we saw in Q4. So I guess the question I'm asking is - and you're 2/3 of way through the quarter now. Are you tracking in line better than that guidance right now given the improving demand trends in January?
Joseph Megibow: Better than the guidance we just gave.
Brian Nagel: Yes.
Joseph Megibow: No, I think our guidance is our guidance. We're more than 2/3 of the way through the quarter, so I think our guidance is likely fairly true. There's a lot that can happen over the next month and continues to be uncertainty. It appears the world may be opening up a little more optimism, and whatever stimulus comes out and the retail spending that may come from that could all be upside for us. That said, I - again, we're pretty far through the quarter, so I think our guidance is fair.
Brian Nagel: Okay. And then the final question, I guess, stepping back a bit. So clearly, we saw in 2020 against a very unique - if you will, a unique backdrop, the DTC business of Purple has always flexed significantly stronger. So as you look forward, I mean - and the question I'm asking or thinking about here is recognizing that there's still capacity constraints within the Purple model, you've said often that you're selling everything you make, but you're refocusing on the wholesale side. Is that refocusing to a certain extent now limiting growth on the DTC side?
Joseph Megibow: No, not at all. And in fact, we continue to push our DTC and as we open up our showrooms. I mean, those are the most favorable economics, and we have no intention of starving our most favorable economic channels for wholesale growth. Really, it just comes down to - it's a big market out there. We still are in early days on taking share, and we're finally able to grow capacity at the levels we wanted to. As you quoted, I've said before, we sell every mattress we make. That's a double-edged sword. And this is the year you won't hear us saying that anymore. Again, we are, this year, building excess capacity, which is exactly where we want to be. We want to have the ability to flex into inventory. We want to be able to have better maintenance schedules. We want to be able to sustain any unplanned downtime. We've been fortunate, as we haven't seen much of that. But we want to have excess capacity, but with the capacity growth, the fastest path forward to take share and service a predominantly offline customer, I mean, the majority of the category is still driven through brick-and-mortar sales. We need to get out there, and our partners have been terrific on the wholesale side. We continue to hear demand, both from existing partners and partners we aren't doing business with. So we are going to use the capacity we have to lean into the lowest friction channel we have for growth, while continuing to support our DTC channel. We're not going to get the 100%-plus growth we saw in Q2 last year in DTC. That was more driven macro. I mean, even in Q4, DTC was still up 57%. So we're continuing to get very healthy growth in DTC. We just expect that to get back to more normal growth levels as we continue to see lots of upside there, and then with the excess capacity we push into our other channels.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.
Curtis Nagle: So I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I know you're not giving a 2022 guidance. But just kind of thinking about taking a step back and thinking about the margin profile longer term, do you guys still envision something potentially sort of in the 15% range in terms of EBITDA? I think it's kind of all else equal, 2022, I think, should be higher than '21 just given the lower proportion of investments and more capacity added at that point and all those sort of things. How should we sort of all kind of think that out in terms of the market profile for the next, I don't know, call it, 2 to 3 years?
Joseph Megibow: We're doing a lot of work internally right now on building out our multiyear road map, and we anticipate being able to share some of that in the near future. But we see - we are going to continue to invest in scale and growth. There is a lot of opportunity in front of us, and we believe we are heading down the path of being a very major player in this category as well as in other categories. That said, there are absolutely opportunities for leverage as we continue to build out our Atlanta facility and get that complete. Even as we open new facilities as a percentage of total expenditures, the new investment becomes smaller, and we're absorbing that overhead. Marketing, which this year, we're continuing around our traditional path of about 30% of net revenue in advertising and selling, we don't anticipate as our total net revenue continues to grow that it will continue to be at that rate. So there's absolutely going to be opportunity for leverage as we move forward in G&A as well and other areas of the business. So yes, I think in 2022, it's reasonable that we could start to see some leverage and beyond. And I mentioned earlier, the manufacturing improvements and the other intrinsic margin improvements with new products built with better margin profiles as well as our ability to continue to raise prices, so, yes, there's a lot to be optimistic about in our ability to bring up both gross margins and EBITDA margins. And there are very specific and describable initiatives to get there. It's just, right now, our focus is obviously a little more near term on taking this foundation we've built and demonstrating how much scale and share we can get from it.
Curtis Nagle: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe just kind of segueing to thinking about non-bedding sales. So it grew nicely. I think you said 140%. I think that implies - but that's 6% percentage of sales, correct me if I'm wrong, so still a fairly small category. It sounds like you guys have a lot in the works going forward. Where do you think you envision that, again, maybe over the next 2 to 3 years in terms of percentage of sales?
Joseph Megibow: Yes. Well, as we report, our non-bedding is a relatively small piece. Pillows is part of our bedding category, so we mixed some segments there just to talk about a couple of specific products. Pillows and seat cushions are great growth engines. And pillows, higher price points, very good attach rate with our mattress. But even more interesting, we're selling far more to customers who haven't yet bought a mattress. So again, we're following industry standards here on how we report, but these are very healthy growth engines. And as you think about CRM and as you think about lifetime value, these open up some really, really interesting opportunities for the company. Historically, we've been one and done. We've been transactionally profitable on a durable good and an infrequent purchase centered around the mattress. And we have relatively amazing growth right now in categories other than the mattress that both have proven attach rates within their category. And those who buy pillows buy more pillows. Those who buy seat cushions buy more seat cushions. But we're also indication that it's driving future opportunity to have a mattress attached down the road. So this is new for us, but it's very exciting and an enormous opportunity that we're tapping into.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley.
Susan Anderson: Nice job on a great 2020. I guess, just to follow up on the revenue for fourth quarter and then in the first quarter. It sounds like you've seen improvement in wholesale. So I guess just based on the guidance, I'm assuming that DTC growth has come down a bit from fourth quarter. And then also just on the cadence of revenue for 2021, given the tough comparison second and third quarter and the guide for first, are you expecting fourth quarter to kind of be the highest growth quarter?
Joseph Megibow: Yes. Well, I mean, back half of the year is - just starting with your - the end of your question, back half of the year, and if you unpack our guidance, you'll see this. We are expecting bigger growth rates than the front half of the year, and that's driven by the initiatives that we are executing over the first half of the year. This is wholesale expansion. This is the showroom we're building out. It's new products launching mid and later in the year. It's the new e-commerce platform that we'll be rolling out throughout the first half of the year and so forth. So there is - there are many, many initiatives that we are investing in, in the first half of the year that will bear fruit in the back half of the year and into 2022. So I think you are reading that correctly, yes. Yes, DTC, the - in DTC, we saw some pretty impressive growth rates last year driven, in large part, by just consumer preference shift on mix that is now getting back to a more normal, if you can call it that, a more normal or healthier mix, which does create some pressure. So yes, we expect that DTC will probably not be in the 80% or 100% growth rates that we saw through much of last year. And frankly, as the base of DTC gets bigger, the growth rates tend to decelerate a little bit. It's just true in any business at certain scale. This is a predominantly offline industry. But we still see very, very healthy growth rates in front of us. We - again, with the changes we're making in product and the website, we see opportunity for significant growth. So we remain optimistic.
Susan Anderson: Okay. Great. And then just on Canada, I'm curious there how that rollout has gone. And what are the plans for this year?
Joseph Megibow: So it's primarily with our partner up there, Sleep Country Canada. They've just reported some healthy results themselves, just indicating they're the right partner for us and a terrific business up in our Northern neighbors. In terms of our launch, we launched very late in 2020. And in part, some of that late launch was some of the supply challenges that everyone in the industry has had, some of the components into those mattresses, which we ultimately resolved and we're able to get the launch done. Our timing wasn't terrific as just - I mean, it felt like days after we launched. With the later wave in Canada, there were mandatory shutdown of approximately 65% of the doors up there. So the performance, obviously, wasn't what any of us had hoped given the store closures. That said, in the stores that are open and on the online side, I think both sides have been extremely pleased with what we're seeing so far. So we remain very optimistic once some of these macro or external factors get lifted.
Susan Anderson: Okay. Great. That sounds good. And then not sure if I missed this, but did you say what the average mattress selling price was in the quarter? And did you see people moving into more premium categories at all?
Joseph Megibow: I don't believe we reported the specific there, but I will say that we continue to see ASP, average order value, both continue to climb quarter-on-quarter. That's been a trend we've had for quite some time, and more exciting is we see that in DTC. In brick-and-mortar, that's always been an easier path forward to get that more premium buyer, but we continue to see DTC climb on the strength of our brand and on the strength of our product.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Hamblin with Craig-Hallum.
Jeremy Hamblin: I want to start with Q1 mix assumptions that you're baking in here in terms of thinking about your wholesale versus your DTC embedded within that guidance since we're 2/3 of the way through the quarter.
Joseph Megibow: Again, for the quarter and largely for much of the year, we anticipate getting back to more of the 70-30 split that we, for many years, have been gotten to what is our preferred mix. We were weighted much more DTC last year at times into the 80s on DTC. But our anticipated mix, Q1, and really ultimately through the year, is along the lines. So 70% DTC, 30% wholesale. I mean, DTC will be weighted a little heavier in Q1 as wholesale continues to come back and as we begin our wholesale expansion. But ultimately, I think we'll be about 70-30 split for the year.
Jeremy Hamblin: Okay. And then as a follow-up to that. Wholesale was 28% of your business in Q4, roughly. And in terms of thinking about the margin profile moving forward, we know you've made some investments in Purple South. There is - I don't know if you've quantified the potential drag, Craig, associated with that, but you did deliver above a 47% gross margin just slightly, with your mix of business, wholesale, 28%. And so in terms of thinking about gross margins as we look at '21, again, understanding there's some investments being made and potentially some higher input costs from suppliers, can you give a sense for - it seems as though that 47% gross margin that you delivered, maybe you can get pretty close to that again in '21.
Craig Phillips: Yes. I mean, I think we will be able to stay close to that 47%. There was headwind early in the year from having the Atlanta facility not be at full operating capacity and then some of the investments we're making, but there's also some tailwinds that are positive that we're going to look forward to, that we will start seeing more of later in the year in efficiencies, not just in getting the Atlanta facility at a higher capacity, but also in the facility we already have in Grantsville, John and his team finding efficiencies and where they can add automation to improve the margin. So we do expect it throughout the year to improve. But like you said, it is going to have some headwinds early just because Atlanta is not at full capacity.
Jeremy Hamblin: Got it. And then in terms of - you have a high percentage of your competitors that have either recently raised price, signal that they're going to raise price, and we know suppliers are also raising price. We know you just did that over the summer, but any comment on whether or not that's something that's been discussed? And if so, timing on when that might happen.
Joseph Megibow: Yes. So we do intend to, call it, raise our ASP this year. There will be mix of some products that we believe there is opportunity to, as they exist today, raise price, but we anticipate some assortment improvements this year as well, where we can tie some of the price increases and improve margin structure to new product launches as well, whether those are modest improvements, but still have a good customer story on the price changes or outright new product. So we do anticipate that. It likely wouldn't realize until probably, call it, late Q2 or mid-year, though we continue to look at the market and the competitive set. And we have successfully raised prices now twice with a remarkably stable elasticity, so that continues to be an option on the table.
Jeremy Hamblin: Great. Last one for me, real quick here. Your G&A took a pretty decent step forward here in the back half of '20. And in terms - if you kind of had a longer-term target around 6% of sales, but it was a little over 7% in Q4, any color that you could share on whether or not you're still kind of planning around that 6%? I know you've mentioned this as an investment year. Is that part of the investment on your G&A side of things that maybe that's going to be a little higher than where your longer-term targets are?
Joseph Megibow: No. I mean, we have always viewed this as an asset of our company on just how operationally sound and our focus on running a rightsized clean business. So yes, Q4 was really more timing than anything, some deferred cost from Q3 that got pushed into Q4 and some cost that were in advance of Q1. So for full year, I believe we were at about 6.2% for 2020, and we anticipate continuing to hold G&A relatively flat.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Mr. Joe Megibow for closing remarks.
Joseph Megibow: Thank you so much. The foundation we built in 2019 was tested last year, and I could not be more pleased with how well our mission-driven team performed. Most importantly, we added record numbers of customers to the Purple family, and customer satisfaction continues to be extremely high, and our ever-growing base of customers remain our most effective marketing channel. Looking forward, we find ourselves in our strongest position ever to invest in product development and scaling our business. We remain very optimistic in the opportunity for growth, both near term and long term, supported by our proven execution ability and our very healthy balance sheet. I want to personally thank our more than 1,600 employees for their relentless fortitude over the last year, an unwavering belief in our mission and our goals. To all of our customers, employees and partners, stay healthy, be safe, and sleep well.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and enjoy the rest of your day."
