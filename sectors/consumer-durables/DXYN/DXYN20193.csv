Gross profit for the quarter was 22.1% of net sales, as compared to 21.5% in 2018. For the third quarter of 2019, our sales and costs were negatively impacted by lower sales in our residential business. We also had $82,000 inventory write-downs related to our restructuring. In addition, we had higher medical expenses relative to the same period a year ago. Selling and administrative expense for the quarter was 22% as compared to 22.7% in 2018. Expenses were down largely due to the cost-cutting efforts under our profit improvement plan.Other items in the quarter included $1 million facility consolidation and severance expenses.

Our total expense reduction from the profit improvement plan as compared to our 2017 cost structure is $18.7 million on an annualized basis.

Dan Frierson: Thank you, Jon. Our residential carpet product sales were down 10.9% for the quarter as compared to the prior year. Our residential carpet sales without our mass merchant channel were lower for the third quarter year-over-year period by 5.1% thus significantly stronger than our mass merchant channel. Our EnVision 6,6 program continues to gaining traction in the market. We continue to expand this program which brings exceptional value to the customer. We have seen growth in our West Coast offering through both our Masland California classics and the Dixie Helm Pacific Living Quick ship collection. Both of these programs are serviced out of our Santa Ana California facility, providing shorter delivery times for our West Coast marketplace.Sales of our new energy collection of Main Street commercial products sold by our Masland Residential sales force continue to increase as more displays are activated in the marketplace. We are also developing additional wool products manufactured on new technology which will be introduced next year and should expand our wool carpet offering. Our residential luxury vinyl flooring and wood sales experienced a greater than 40% increase in sales in the third quarter of the fiscal year as compared to the same period in the prior year. During the third quarter of 2019, we had great traction with our new TruCor SPC offering, including placement of over 2,000 displays in the retail community. And by the end of the quarter, TruCor represented a significant percentage of our luxury vinyl sales.During the fourth quarter of 2019, we are expanding our TruCor line with the addition of TruCor Prime a WPC construction offered by our Dixie Helm and Masland sales forces. By the end of 2019, we anticipate having over 4,800 TruCor and TruCor Prime displays in the market. During the first quarter of 2020, we're expanding our TruCor rigid core offering with 47 new and innovative products in the SPC and WPC constructions. To further drive growth in this segment during the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2020, we're making investments in talent by adding hard surface salespeople in key markets. These investments in product and talent will accelerate our hard surface growth going forward.Our commercial carpet product sales in the third quarter were down less than 1% while the industry we believe was down in the low single digits as compared to the same period in the prior year. Our commercial luxury vinyl flooring sales were up over 40% comparing to the third quarter of 2019 -- comparing the third quarter of 2019 with the same quarter of 2018. Our commercial division has launched a number of new offerings for 2019 with particular emphasis on modular carpet tile. We are especially excited about the launch of our Sustaina modular tile backing system. This system is a PVC and polyurethane free cushion modular carpet tile backing with very high recycled content. The product is breathable and able to be installed in environments up to 99% relative humidity and up to a pH of 12 when utilizing our custom-formulated, Sustaina 99 adhesive.The product provides the cushion backing benefits of increased underfoot comfort, apparent retention and sound absorption. We have just launched Crafted with our Sustaina backing system. This product has 81.5% total recycled content, the highest available in the market today. These unique products differentiating us in the marketplace and fulfilling the needs of our discerning environmentally conscious customers will accelerate our growth.In summary, during this year we've consolidated our two commercial brands and Atlas Masland contract under one management, sharing operations and marketing, product development, manufacturing and with a consolidated sales force. We launched Sustaina with over 80% post-consumer recycled material, PVC and polyurethane free. We launched TruCor and TruCor prime. We saw great traction with our TruCor SPC offering. By the end of 2019, as I stated earlier, we will have over 4,800 displays in the market and we're adding hard surface salespeople in certain territories to enhance the growth of the sales we are already experiencing. We began shipment of our new EnVision 6,6 soft floor covering collection. This production line consists of beautifully styled products at moderate price points to reach a wider range of customers.We're progressing with our profit improvement plan as Jon pointed out. We have now reduced costs -- annualized costs by over $18 million. Operationally, we continue to improve. Our service levels have improved significantly in the commercial business and we've made changes in the residential operations to shorten delivery times. Our plant operations have shown improvement as our turnover has improved in most of our operations. The cost of quality has continued to decline and is at levels that are near our long term goal. We have continued to experience higher than anticipated medical costs but we have recently replaced both of our traditional preferred provider network plans and are beginning to see the impact -- the positive impact.We anticipate capital expenditures will be in the $4 million range this year and appreciates in amortization in excess of $11 million. The gain in sale of our Susan Street plant represents a major improvement of our balance sheet with a significant reduction of that and over 50% increase in equity. Since the end of the third quarter last year to now we have reduced debt by approximately $55 million.At this time, we would like to open up the call to any of your questions.
Dan Frierson: Victor, thank you very much. And we thank all of you for joining us today. We look forward to investing with you at the end of next quarter. We continue to work at improving our operations and investing in the areas of the marketplace that are growing. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation."
