For today's call, Rich will highlight a few big picture themes, Gerald will provide a sense of what is happening in our businesses and Rick will emphasize some of the financial aspects of our results. I will now turn the call over to Rich.
Richard A. Noll: Thank you, T.C. Let me start off by saying how pleased we are to report strong second quarter results that include record operating margins and earnings. When you consider the current soft retail environment, this is a significant accomplishment and one that underscores a very simple message. Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is working very well. We had a record 15% operating margin in the quarter and our success is broad-based. We saw all 4 segments improve versus last year and our 3 largest segments: Innerwear, Activewear and International produced double-digit operating margins. The core tenant of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is straightforward, expand our margins by leveraging our strong brands, innovation platforms and our global supply chain. And we are seeing it work across all of our innovation platforms: Smart Sizes; TAGLESS; ComfortBlend and now, X-TEMP. And these platforms are not only benefiting our financial performance, they are also helping our retail partners, as our innovative products drive higher consumer demand, higher average unit selling prices and higher productivity levels. The momentum we are seeing from Innovate-to-Elevate, along with our strong first half results, gives us confidence to raise our 2013 guidance. We're taking up our EPS range $0.25 and our free cash flow range, $100 million. This updated guidance places us firmly within our target operating margin range of 12% to 14%, a year earlier than anticipated. And we are just getting started. The true earnings power of our business is only beginning to shine through. Significant earnings potential remains as we push to the higher end of our operating margin goal. When you combine the current momentum in our business, coupled with a $0.10 to $0.15 contribution from Maidenform, a reasonable goal for 2014 EPS is in the low $4 range. So to wrap up, our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is working, our margins are expanding, our cash flow is increasing and when you couple all that with Maidenform, we see significant earnings potential that could drive performance for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald.
Gerald W. Evans: Thanks, Rich. We're very excited about the improvement we've seen in the second quarter across all of our businesses, as our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy continues to demonstrate the power of combining our great brands, meaningful innovation and global supply chain. Before we look at the highlights in the quarter, I'd like to share our perspective on the retail environment. If you remember, sell-through at retail was particularly weak in Q1 due to traffic disruptions and weather. It improved somewhat in Q2, but is still choppy overall. This retail softness negatively impacted our shipments in Innerwear basics in Q1 and in intimate apparel mainly in Q2. Retail inventories are now on the right levels and have normalized to where we feel good about retailers' weeks of supply heading into the back-to-school selling period. Now I'd like to give you an update on our innovation platforms and their growing success as we push these platforms across Innerwear and Activewear. First, our Smart Sizes platform, which represents nearly 1/3 of our bras, continued to build momentum across our Bra and Sportswear business with sales at retail increasing by 30% in the quarter. Our TAGLESS platform also continue to expand in the quarter. Shipments of our new TAGLESS bottoms are strong and we continue to leverage this platform across many different categories. Our third platform, ComfortBlend, continues to expand as well. It now encompasses socks, male and women's underwear and is rolling out in our Activewear business. I'd also like to update you on a new innovation we previewed at Investor Day, it's called X-TEMP and it leverages temperature-regulating technology to keep you comfortable all day. X-TEMP carries a meaningful price premium at retail of over 50% compared to our core cotton products and nearly 20% over our ComfortBlend products. It has gained a tremendous amount of traction right out of the gate and we are very excited about the results. While X-TEMP started as a product innovation, it has now been elevated to become our fourth innovation platform, which we will use to gain incremental shelf space, as we expand it into other categories. Turning to our segments. I'd like to start today with Activewear where our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy has lifted operating margins to over 12% in the quarter, driving innovation in Champion and deemphasizing the commodity product and branded printwear were the key components for the profit improvement. For the first half, Activewear margins were just over 10%, a first for this segment. And I believe we should see margins continue in the low double digits on a consistent basis. In Innerwear, we saw very strong profitability, driven by improvements across both Basics and Intimates. Men's Underwear and Socks led the way with double-digit sales increases and strong margin expansion. In Intimates, despite the inventory adjustment at retail in the quarter, our full figure bra business, which includes Bali, Playtex and Just My Size, was up about 4%. Media continued to run ahead of last year in the quarter, as our ComfortBlend and TAGLESS ads featuring Michael Jordan were aired around Father's Day. While our media spending has increased approximately $10 million year-to-date, we are on track to spend the full incremental $30 million to $40 million for the year. In Q3, we will begin to substantially increase our media spending as we launch new campaigns featuring Hanes panties and Playtex bras. We will also continue to support our Basics categories through the balance of the year. Finally, in our International segment, sales for the quarter declined 1%, but were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit increased 7% and our operating margin was back in the low double digits. We continue to execute our regionalization strategy, where we are aligning our international businesses into 4 key regions in order to leverage both our regional expertise and global supply chain and to more quickly introduce our innovation platforms across geographies. However, currency is shaping up to be a bigger headwind in the second half and is expected to knock 10 full percentage points off sales growth in our International segment, because approximately half of our business is weighted to countries that have rapidly depreciating currencies such as Brazil, Argentina, Japan and Australia. On a constant currency basis, we actually expect sales to continue to increase in the low to mid single digits. So to wrap up, I am very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. As Rich said, we are seeing the results of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. It's great to see Activewear with a year-to-date operating margin above 10% and focused on delivering profitable growth. As we turn our attention to executing back-to-school with our retail partners, we are cautiously optimistic about the consumer, but feel our strong brands are well positioned going into this key selling period. I will now turn the call over to Rick to discuss our financial performance.
Richard D. Moss: Thanks, Gerald. Let me start by discussing our record earnings, as this illustrates the success of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and our ability to execute our plans and highlights just how much the recession and the hyperinflation in cotton mask the true earnings power of our business model. EPS for the quarter was $1.19, an increase of 78% from last year. Let me talk to you about how we were able to achieve those record earnings for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion, up about 2% versus prior year. Adjusting for the planned decline in branded printwear of $5 million and a currency headwind of $7 million, sales were up closer to 3% in the quarter. Operating profit increased 51% from last year to $181 million, representing a record margin of 15.1%. The key driver of this improvement was our gross profit margin, which was 36.3%, an increase of 520 basis points from last year's rate, with about 100 to 150 basis points coming from Innovate-to-Elevate. While you haven't seen it for a few years because of cotton, this year, we expect a more normal seasonal pattern for gross margins with Q2 being the high watermark for the year. SG&A in the quarter increased $7 million from last year, of which $6 million was from planned increases in media spending. And interest expense declined $11 million from last year, as a result of paying down long-term debt. Moving to the balance sheet where we continue to drive improvements, inventories declined $99 million from the same period last year with about half of the decline coming from lower units in inventory. I'd now like to spend some time on our updated 2013 guidance. With respect to sales, we slightly lowered our full year guidance to approximately $4.55 billion from our prior level of approximately $4.6 billion, due to the sales softness in the first half and the currency headwinds Gerald highlighted in his earlier remarks. To help with the currency impact in the context of total company sales, it's expected to lower the second half growth rate by a full percentage point. We raised our operating profit guidance to $550 million to $575 million from our prior range of $500 million to $550 million, implying an operating margin between 12% and 13%. Looking at the second half, we continue to expect an additional $20 million to $30 million in incremental media spend when compared with the second half of last year. Interest and other related expense is expected to be $120 million, which includes $15 million in prepayment expense to retire the remaining $250 million of 8% senior notes. This expense is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. The full year tax rate is expected to be in the teens. We increased our EPS guidance to $3.50 to $3.65, from our previous range of $3.25 to $3.40. The increase is driven by our year-to-date performance, which was ahead of our expectations, as well as the slightly improved outlook for the second half. With respect to our cash flow guidance, we now expect to generate $450 million to $550 million in free cash flow, up from our prior range of $350 million to $450 million. This includes expected pension contributions of approximately $38 million and net capital expenditures of approximately $50 million. Now turning to our debt. Assuming the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance of $500 million, we plan to use $250 million to pay off the remainder of our 8% senior notes and $60 million to pay dividends, leaving us around $200 million to help pay for the Maidenform acquisition. So we should exit the year with long-term debt of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, implying a long-term debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2 1/4 times, excluding any earnings impact from Maidenform. Going forward, we'll no longer talk about specific debt targets, rather we'll focus on where we are in relation to our targeted long-term debt-to-EBITDA range of 1.5x to 2.5x. In closing, a strong first half results could put us in a great position to be able to raise guidance midway through the year, and we're thrilled to be tracking ahead of schedule in achieving our target margin goal of 12% to 14%. As the financial impact from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and acquisition synergies drive higher levels of sustainable free cash flow, we see a significant amount of opportunity to create further shareholder value for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.
T.C. Robillard: Thanks, Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the second quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.
Omar Saad: I wanted to focus on the top line, though, obviously. It know it sounds like there's some currency going on in there and the Innovate-to-Elevate strategy's really working. Can you help us bridge the gap, when you've got all these great new products and platforms coming to the marketplace and how we should kind of bridge that gap to where the sales trends are and think about an algorithm on the sales line longer-term, maybe there's a little bit more low- to mid-single digits, as opposed to what looks like from the pretty low single digits this year?
Richard A. Noll: Sure. So I'll just take you back to our long-term organic growth trend is 2% to 4%, my personal goal is 3% or 4%. We're sort of right in and around there with one sort of -- from an overall standpoint, with the exception that currency, obviously, is weighing in on our business, which I think is a little bit of a surprise given how small International is as a part of our mix. It's unfortunate that a lot of our International business is focused on areas that have rapidly depreciating currencies. And so that's not going to, I think, knock a full point of growth off of our top line. And I think the other anomaly is what we saw in the first quarter, right, which is just sort of overall soft retail environment that's sort of working its way through our shipments first in Q1 in Basics and then in Q2. So when you correct that out, we feel pretty good about our overall trend given that it's a relatively choppy retail environment. So you're talking about a couple of points of growth, excluding currency, back half's probably about 2.5% and that's in our long-term organic growth range.
Omar Saad: Are there any specific brands, Rich, or lines or categories that may be are a little bit more disappointing than others, where you think you can internally drive some improvement?
Gerald W. Evans: This is Gerald, just to follow up on that. No, I would say in general, we saw a good -- we're seeing good performance. Our innovations are all performing very well. Certainly, the adjustment in Intimates came this quarter while we felt the adjustment in inventory last quarter in Basics. It came early in the quarter and we certainly saw the inventories rationalize. And we think we're well positioned now moving forward.
Richard A. Noll: And I think it's also important to say, inherent in our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, which is to drive innovation, to leverage our strong brands and help us and our retailers drive average unit ring up, I think it's critical to understand, that's not all about driving units at any price, it is about quality of earnings and going after segments of the market or subsegments of the market that are willing to pay more for innovation where you can ultimately make more money. So we're as much focused, if not more focused, on that operating profit increase as we are in just raw units on driving the top line.
Operator: And your next question comes from Eric Tracy with G&A Capital Market.
Eric B. Tracy: I guess, if I could follow-up on that, Rich and/or Gerald, just in terms of the units moving higher with these new platforms, I mean, talk us through how we should think about the mixing up from a pricing perspective on a go-forward basis. You've got X-TEMP getting layered in. Obviously, scaling of ComfortBlend and Smart Size, just how should we start to think about kind of the unit versus pricing algorithm? Obviously, now relatively stabilized cotton environment right now, but how should we think about that going forward?
Richard A. Noll: I think what's really important is for us to sort of just pull back and make sure that you understand how we focus and it's on driving the top line in dollars within our range, as well as then driving our margins to get to the levels that we think is critical. And while units is obviously on top of our mind, it's not the first and foremost thing on our mind. In our category, these are relatively stable, especially in Innerwear. We've talked about how the pairs purchased per person per year has been relevant -- relatively stable for well over a decade. But the secret is if you've got a great product like X-TEMP, where somebody's willing to pay 30%, or in that case 50% more than the regular stuff, you're going to drive -- you're going to make that consumer happy. You're going to drive improvements for our retailer and you'll ultimately been allow us to make a little bit more money. And that's sort of the overall business model. The bits and pieces of it, I don't want to try and get into, it's really an integrated strategy, to drive those -- Innovate-to-Elevate is drive our big brands with innovation and leverage our global supply chain. And all 3 of those things work synergistically to help us improve our margins. When you look at our inherent guidance for the year, I think that's really the story to take away, which this we came into this year thinking of operating margins in that 11% to 12%. We're now sitting here saying they're going to be between 12% and 13% because those 3 components of Innovate-to-Elevate are working synergistically and we feel really good about our results and that's why we're taking our full year guidance up.
Operator: Your next question comes from Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs.
Taposh Bari: I wanted to ask just -- you operate in different tiers or price strategy, just curious to see if you saw any kind the difference between mass or department stores or other channels during the quarter?
Richard A. Noll: No, I wouldn't say that we saw a significant difference between channels in the quarter. They generally behave the same and we saw the adjustments in Basics, predominantly in Q1 and Intimates in Q2 and across the channels.
Taposh Bari: Okay. And then, Rich, on the capital allocation theme that I think you've laid out and executed pretty well on, I guess, the next potential piece of the puzzle could be share buybacks. How do we think about that? When can that potentially start to materialize?
Richard A. Noll: I've always talked about uses of free cash flow now in 3 buckets: Dividends, bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases. And I think if -- as I said, if we zoom ahead 5 or 7 years and look back, I think you're going to see a balance between those 3 things. But in any given year, you're not going to see a balance, it's always going to be weighted more heavily one towards the other. On a go-forward basis, we don't really have a strong predisposition between those 3 things, but we have had a clear near-term priority. With the first priority being to institute a dividend. The second opportunity obviously as we talked about last week of being able to take advantage of the Maidenform acquisition. At some point, share buybacks will come in to that mix, I'm firmly convinced of that. Exactly when, it remains to be seen. But I do think over time, you'll see sort of more of a balanced mixture of all of those things.
Taposh Bari: Okay. Just last one, if I may. Just looking at your implied guidance, looks lack back -- kind of back of the envelope math, EBIT, you're modeling down about 2% in the back half, but there's an increase in ad spend or marketing spend so I think it's up about mid singles on a 1% type of sales growth gain in the back half of the year adjusted for marketing spend. Does that sound right, Rick?
Richard D. Moss: Yes. The SG&A spend in the back half of the year will be up about $20 million to $30 million, and that's pretty much the marketing spend for the -- the increased marketing spend year-over-year.
Taposh Bari: So as you anniversary these -- the cotton inflationary benefits from the past year, is that a fair relationship to think about low single digit, rev growth and mid single-digit EBIT growth and then the rest gets made up for vis-a-vis capital allocation. Is that the right way to think about the earnings algorithm here?
Richard A. Noll: I don't think so. I think what's really important is to go back to a slide that Rick talked about on Investor Day. And that was where he showed how our business is relatively when stable on an annualized basis, but is highly volatile within on a quarterly basis. And that's going to be true for a quarter and for 2 quarters. And so we never think of our business on terms of what are those macro trends just driven by what happened in a quarter. For example, we're not taking up the full year guidance because we had a good quarter, nor will we take down the full year guidance if we ever just had 1 bad quarter. We're going to react to what are those major trend changes in our business, what's showing through and what's going to happen on an annualized basis. We have that volatility in the short term, but it all tends to, pun intended, sort of come out in the wash on an annualized basis. So I'd be very cautious to try and extrapolate by a calculation for 1 or 2 quarters to, okay, that's the exact trend that's happening in this business. You need to always look at us on more of an annualized basis.
Operator: And your next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays.
Matthew McClintock: I was just wondering, Rich, if you could maybe remind us, I think when you did Gear For Sports, it was accretive in the first year by roughly $0.20. And while it's not specific guidance, you did mention that you think it's reasonable that Maidenform could do, I think $0.10 to $0.15. I was just wondering if you can maybe, just up from a high-level, talk about the differences between the 2 integrations and why you wouldn't think Maidenform could potentially be more accretive given that it's a substantially larger business?
Richard A. Noll: Yes. We feel really good about our long-term guidance that we talked about that Maidenform could add $0.60 to EPS within 3 years when synergies are fully realized. And it is something where you sit there and go, ""Okay, well why don't we expect $0.20 in the first year, grow on to $0.40 and then to $0.60. But at this time, remember, I don't think that would be actually very prudent. Remember, they're going through a trend change with some of their business. We've got to get in there. They're already repositioning some of it. We'll need to reposition a little bit. And given that we haven't fully gotten in and fully developed our integration plans, I think it makes a lot of sense to keep our eye on making sure we deliver that $0.60 as quickly as possible, but let's be mindful of what we don't know in the near term and not get overly bullish and then disappoint ourselves based on what we are absolutely convinced is a great long-term deal. Over the next couple of quarters, we'll have more and more information, as we talked about, we'll have more information on third quarter call. And then finally, on our fourth quarter call, when we give full-blown 2014 guidance, we'll be able to bridge all that for you.
Matthew McClintock: Okay. And then if I -- you kind of highlighted it, you hit up on, on it a little bit, but they do, Maidenform, if I recall correctly, had a lot of innovation that they were launching in the back half of this year. I think they were making entry into full figure bras with the Maidenform brand and there was further innovation going on next year, which I think bodes very well with your Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. I was just wondering if you could talk about that potentially? Is that still on track? Are you still going to launch those products? And within that specifically dialing in on the intimate category, I know there was a little bit of weakness this quarter. Could we potentially see an acceleration from what you say are now more stabilized trends for intimate apparel, bras, panties, given this innovation?
Richard A. Noll: That's pretty easy to answer because it's only been a week since we announced the acquisition so -- and we only have a deal. So right now, we are still competitors. We have to operate at such. We're 2 independent companies. And until close, that will be the case, so we're not involved or will we be involved in any part of what their launch plans are or what their plans are with retail until after the close of the business. So that's all yet to come and be developed and so we've got to take it a step at a time. Pretty soon, we'll be taking the next step, which is filing the antitrust thing. They'll be filing the proxy after that. Once we have closure, we'll be able to give you a lot more line of sight to exactly what those plans are. In terms of the other question, which is sort of macro what's going on with intimate apparel, I think at the end of the day, we've talked, since the great recession, that, that category has never fully recovered, as we've seen some of the men's and other categories in even women's apparel. Intimate apparel's sort of been gone through its ebbs and flows since the recession. We don't anticipate that changing. What I do think we'll be able to do is we'll have a broader platform to drive our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and that will be a good thing for both consumers and retailers, and obviously, our strong financial perspective.
Operator: And your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.
Jim Duffy: Another great quarter from the Innerwear margins. Within the Innerwear margins, can you speak to the variance you're seeing between the socks and underwear versus the intimates? And then in the context of the long-term 12% to 14% EBIT margin objective, where do you expect the underwear margins to settle?
Richard D. Moss: Well, I don't want to get into the specifics on any of those individual lines other than to say that we're doing very well in all of them. We're making money in all of those lines and feel very good about the margin improvement in those lines.
Richard A. Noll: In terms of where it would settle out long term, I think that, that business is always going to be inherently -- have higher profit characteristics than Activewear, as we've talked about over time just because of the replenishment nature. What I'm really thrilled about is, as we've now started to graft Innovate-to-Elevate onto Activewear, we've made huge strides in getting that segment into double digits. And I think that a lot of credit goes to Gerald and that team in getting us there, so we feel really good about how we're able to translate that strategy into a broader set of our segments. And that's where you're seeing a lot of improvement as well.
Jim Duffy: So, Rich, if we look at these Innerwear margins in the low-20s as being a femoral or is that something you see as sustainable over the long term and some of the other categories, just closed the gap with that?
Richard A. Noll: And this is where -- I'm going to go back to my comment about -- given the fact that our business, our total business can be fairly volatile in a given quarter, clearly within a segment, you can see things sort of fluctuate up-and-down and I'd be cautious to not extrapolate what you see in a quarter or 2, especially within a segment, as okay, that's the new long-term trend. You want to look at our business always on an annualized basis, rolling 4 quarter basis and that will give you a little bit more insight into sort of what those trends are. So that's -- I think that's enough to say about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.
Eric B. Tracy: Rick, I was actually just going to follow-up on our discussion, again, about the Innovate-to-Elevate, how it's mixing up with the price. Just in the broader scheme of the long-term operating margin target of that 12% to 14%, clearly going to be in that range this year. Between the Activewear business improving profitability, the scaling up and supply chain of the core and then ultimately layering in and integrating Maidenform, it seems like that number might prove to be conservative. I know you want to set an appropriate bar, but, again, how do we just think about that longer term?
Richard D. Moss: Yes. Well, Eric, I've always said that -- because I've been asked this question multiple times and I've always said, hey, I'll address whether or not 12% to 14% is the right goals for us once we hit it. And I guess we just said that we've hit it, so you're asking, right? So that's fair. I think that, one, we're thrilled that we're hitting it this quickly and it's a little bit earlier than we anticipated. I would have expected it, I think originally, we would’ve projected it at being next year. And so that speaks to the strength of our brands, our innovations are working and I don't want us to forget the great global supply chain that helps us keep our cost low. In terms of where we can go from there, I think we do need to step back and think about it from a long-term perspective, start to think through what integration of Maidenform means and then probably reset that bar. I don't want to do it today, the good thing is we're sort of on the lower end of that range and so we've got a lot of potential to move up towards the higher end of the range and clearly that should be a goal. Whether -- where we can go from there, give us a little bit of time to think it through and try and reset that goal appropriately and thoughtfully.
Eric B. Tracy: Okay. And then if I could, just one more, in terms of free cash getting bumped up here another $100 million, is that fair to sort of think about on a go-forward basis annually in that $450 million to $550 million, maybe for you, Rick. And secondly for Rich, just in terms of allocation beyond sort of the buyback dividend and/or acquisitions. And thinking about maybe the CapEx investments that need to be made at International in developing that organic growth because, again, I think it...
Richard D. Moss: First of all, on the growth for this year, it's driven by, a, the increased profitability that we now expect versus our original guidance. And, b, an improved outlook on our part on where our working capital management is going to go for this year. In terms of longer term, we've always said that as time goes on and profitability increases, that ""normalized"" $400 million would increase. We've said that we expect to generate by year 3, $65 million of free cash flow via Maidenform. So, yes, it will continue to go up over time.
Richard A. Noll: In terms of CapEx, both internationally or if Maidenform's going to have any additional CapEx, we've always talked about -- we've just gone through a few years ago recapitalizing the supply chain so we could actually cut capital a little bit. But then over a couple of years by starting in '14 and '15, that's going to start to move back towards depreciation and amortization. I think that's the right level for us long term to stay competitive and invest in our business and invest for growth. So I don't see any major change from that perspective.
Operator: And your next question comes from Scott Krasik with BB&T.
Scott D. Krasik: Rich, it seems like you turned the corner on International and for a while, you were focusing on domestic because there were just headwinds and macro issues. So is this now more of a sustainably growing business x currency? And now what's the outlook towards both organic growth internationally longer term and potential acquisitions?
Gerald W. Evans: Scott, this is Gerald. Let me address the first part of your question first. Certainly, International had a very solid quarter on a constant currency basis, up 5%. And we are making good progress in executing our regionalization strategy that we laid out. I think the best indication of that is we first focused in Canada. We had very strong results in Canada in the double-digit range. So we feel good about the progress there. As we look forward, yes, we do think we're seeing that on a constant currency basis will be through the back half of this year and the mid- to -- or the low- to mid-single-digit rate and we feel like we have some momentum back in that. Of course we've got to overcome the headwind of currency, but that will pass in time and we think we've got some momentum there.
Richard A. Noll: In terms of long term from an acquisitions standpoint, I've always said that acquisitions that fit in our criteria: Core category, cost synergies, complementary growth synergies and great returns for shareholders. We've never said that geography is off limits. In fact, one of the complementary growth opportunities would be a geographic expansion, somewhere in our core categories. I've used examples of how we may have a strong Men's Underwear business in 1 market and doing a small Intimate apparel acquisition to build critical mass could make sense. So clearly, that can be part of our long-term strategy and it's something that's clearly in our minds.
Scott D. Krasik: Okay. And then just on Maidenform, it's been 5 more days. Maybe you can touch on the selling side. I mean, you're constantly sort of talking down what you're going to have to rationalize, but what are the opportunities to innovate and elevate Maidenform?
Richard A. Noll: I think they've got -- it's only been 5 days, so we really haven't made much progress. And to be honest, we went from that to actually focusing on getting ready for this call. And so we haven't really made any progress. I'll just reiterate what I said last week, which is they've got great brands. It's why it's an attractive acquisition for us. We think they've got a lot of great things that as we grafted on to our overall, more disciplined Innovate-to-Elevate program, leveraging our supply chain, innovation they do and innovation we do and our collective strong brands, we can have complementary growth opportunities and I think more than that would be premature. We'll talk more about it over time, as we develop more specifics.
Operator: And your next question comes from Andrew Burns with D.A. Davidson.
Andrew Burns: My question is on the Activewear margins. You had phenomenal improvement in the first half with cotton being the largest driver. Can you provide some color on the non-cotton drivers, such as innovation, mix, in-sourcing of non-cotton programs? What are you benefiting from right now in those terms and where is the bulk of the margin opportunity going forward?
Gerald W. Evans: Sure, Andrew. As you've laid out or asked the question, there's certainly 2 elements to that. One, first was deemphasizing the commodity portions of our printwear business, which we have certainly done. But a large part of the growth in this quarter and as we go forward is coming from really executing our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy against that branded Activewear business that we're focused on. It's leveraging our strong brands both the Champion brand, the C9 brand and the Hanes brand bringing in innovations. We introduced our Vapor products, as well as some new sports bras in the quarter and then, of course, internalizing production into our supply chain. All of which we're doing, all of which is driving that margin improvement. And we expect to continue to hold that sort of double-digit operating margin on an ongoing basis now. So it really is that model coming together. And I should add into that the acquisition of gear gave us a nice platform as well to further enhance margins and build our brand and position in the business. So we feel real good about where that business is going. We've got nice momentum and we think we can certainly continue to see that going forward.
Andrew Burns: And one quick question, just in terms of Maidenform. In your initial guidance, there was the expectation of for more than $500 million in revenue, that those are year 3 numbers. As we think about our 2014 in building out that initial EPS relative to, I think consensus is for '13 for Maidenform is $580 million, should we be thinking that there'll be the quick exit of some programs so that we should be thinking about a number closer to $500 million in 2014? Or is it going to take perhaps a couple of years to get there, if it indeed ever gets there?
Richard A. Noll: So since we don't have the exact plans yet, I can't answer you specifically, but I can tell you philosophically how we'd want to approach things. And that is -- and remember, they've already started some of their trend change and sort of retrenching and pulling back on some of their areas. But if you're going to do something, you want to do it fast. You want to get it behind you as quickly as possible rather than trying to spill it out over a large number of years. I don't think it's going to be a huge amount of change. We've talked about probably about 10% of the revenue as a good way of thinking of what we use to sort of the long-term model. But it's not something we're going to peel out over slowly over many, many years. It's something you'll more than likely would go in and do and try and do pretty quickly. But it's stuff on the margin. That said, we don't have any plans yet. We've got to get in there, we're going to understand exactly what we need to do and then as time goes on, we'll give you more line of sight, as we know our specific plans.
Operator: And your next question comes from Eric Beder with Brean Capital.
Eric M. Beder: Could you talk about the rollout of Platinum in Macy's and how that's doing? And how should we think about next year in terms of paying down the debt from the Maidenform deal? A, what interest rates should we think about? And how quickly can you do it? Given all that you have, it might feel that it sounds like you can build maybe a little bit quicker than the 1.5 years that you talked about originally?
Gerald W. Evans: This is Gerald. Let me address the Macy's part of the question first and then I'll turn it over for the second half. The Hanes program at Macy's really didn't place at retail until late June, so it's a little early to read the results there. What I can tell you though is that they began selling the product online earlier and it's performed quite well there. And I think, certainly, we see positive results. Macy's is very excited about the launch and we have every reason to believe this program is going to be a big success. And I think it does show once again the ability of Hanes brand to span all those classes at trade. It's truly unique and a testament to the brand's strength.
Richard A. Noll: In terms of the overall cash flow, debt paydown and then the interest expense for debt, I just want to remind you, first, I'll turn it over to Rick, but remind you that remember, our cash flow generation is somewhat lumpy. We're usually using cash in the first quarter first half and generating cash in the back half. So when you think about it, we've sort of think of it almost as sort of year chunks or 6 months chunks and so -- but with that, Rick, you want to answer that specifically?
Richard D. Moss: No, Richard, you're exactly right. Keep in mind that we did increase the size of our revolver last week to $1.1 billion and got a pricing decrease as a result of that. So we'll be funding the Maidenform transaction from free cash flow, as we talked about a little earlier and from revolver outstandings, which will be 2% or slightly less in terms of the effective interest rate on that.
Operator: And your next question comes from Carla Casella with JPMorgan.
Paul Simenauer: This is Paul Simenauer on the line for Carla Casella. I just have a few questions. First, what was the cotton benefit in this quarter? And what does the gross margin comparison versus last year look like in the back half?
Richard A. Noll: In terms of cotton, last year, in the second quarter, our average cotton cost was $1.84. This year, it's $0.93 a pound. In terms of comparisons to the back -- in terms of the back half, as we talked about, we believe that the second quarter will be our highest quarter in terms of gross profit margin, primarily because this is Innerwear's -- really their strongest sales quarter and they obviously have the highest margins in the business. As we move through Q3 and 4, you'll see Activewear as a percentage of sales go up and that will have -- that will average the gross margin rate down albeit higher than last year. So we will continue to see year-over-year improvement in our gross profit margins through the balance of this year.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to Mr. Robillard for closing remarks.
T.C. Robillard: Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for attending our call today and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great night.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
