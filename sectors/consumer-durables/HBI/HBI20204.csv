"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Hanesbrands' Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in listen-only mode.  After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Mr. T.C. Robillard, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.
T.C. Robillard: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Hanesbrands' quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the fourth quarter of 2020. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. The news release, updated FAQ document, and a replay of this call can be found in the Investors section of our hanes.com Web site. On the call today, we may make forward-looking statements, either in our prepared remarks, or in the associated question-and-answer session. These statements are based on current expectations or beliefs, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These risks include those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by governmental or regulatory authorities to combat the pandemic on our business and operations, as well as the business and operations of the consumer, our customers, suppliers, business partners, and labor force. These risks also include those detailed in our various filings with the SEC, which may be found on our Web site, as well as in our news releases. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, which speak only to the time at which they are made. Unless otherwise noted, today's references to our consolidated financial results and guidance exclude all restructuring and other action-related charges. The use of the term PPE relates to our Personal Protection Garment business including face masks, face coverings and gowns. Also please note that unless otherwise stated, all prior year comparisons are to 2019 results that have been rebased to reflect the exited C9 Champion program at Target and the DKNY intimate license. Additional information, including a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP performance measures to GAAP, can be found in today's press release. With me on the call today are Steve Bratspies, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Lewis, our Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. For today' call, Steve and Scott will provide some brief remarks and then we'll open it up to your questions. I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Bratspies: Thank you, T.C. Good morning everyone, and welcome. It's hard to believe it has been a year since the pandemic began, and I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. To that end, I want to begin by thanking the entire Hanesbrands team around the world for its ongoing dedication, the hard work and focus on safety and service. I'm extremely proud of how much the team has accomplished over the past year, especially under such challenging circumstances.
Scott Lewis: Thanks, Steve. Overall, Hanesbrands delivered solid fourth quarter results. On an adjusted basis, we exceeded the high end of our expectations across all of our key metrics, driven by continued top line momentum. Looking at the details of our fourth quarter results, sales increased 8% over prior year to $1.8 billion. Excluding PPE, sales increased nearly 7% as we experienced continued sequential improvement in our Innerwear, Activewear, and International segments. For the quarter, FX in the 53rd week contributed 190 and 290 basis points of growth, respectively. Adjusted gross margin, of 41%, was above our expectations for the quarter due to higher sales and product mix. As compared to last year, gross margin declined 80 basis points due to the expected negative manufacturing variances, which were partially offset by higher sales and favorable product mix. Adjusted operating margin declined 250 basis points over prior year, to 12% as the gross margin declined along with the expected higher cost tied to COVID and our full potential plan more than offset benefits from higher sales and mix. Pretax restructuring and related charges were $661 million in the quarter, of which 96% were non-cash. The vast majority of these costs, approximately $611 million, were inventory-related charges tied with the business simplification actions Steve mentioned as we began implementing our full potential plan.
Steve Bratspies: Thank you, Scott. We are excited about our future. And we are confident in our ability to build on our business momentum in 2021 while also positioning the company for long-term success. I would now like to spend a few minutes providing some additional details on our full potential plan. For the plan, we have defined our four pillars of growth and identified the initiatives to unlock this growth and create a more efficient and productive business model. My confidence in the strengths of HanesBrands that I outlined on last quarter's call has only been reinforced as we have developed our growth strategy. We have iconic brands. We have global breath and supply chain scale. We have a solid balance sheet. We have a longstanding commitment to sustainability. And, we have a dedicated passionate team with a genuine appetite and readiness for change. This is a strong foundation to leverage in capturing opportunities for growth and driving shareholder value. With respect to our four growth pillars of our full potential plan; they are grow Champion globally. Drive innerwear growth with products and brands that appeal to younger consumers. Build ecomm excellence channels. And, streamline our global portfolio. Touching briefly on each of these, first, with Champion we are making rapid progress developing our global brand strategy that defines our consumer segments, geographies, product offering, and channels of distribution. We have solid momentum in this business. And we are being thoughtful on how we position the brand going forward. We see significant opportunity to grow Champion over the next three-four years. We're engaging directly with the consumers through digital platforms. We are leveraging our global design centers to deliver innovative products. We're category expansion including greater focus on women's and kids as well as layered outerwear and casual athletic footwear. And we are expanding in China with our partners through an integrated front-end strategy, standalone stores and online. Our second growth pillar is to get younger in innerwear. In Australia, we have built our momentum by fueling the growth of our Bonds and Bras N Things brands, particularly through our D2C channels. In the U.S., our plan is to build on our recent innerwear growth by shifting our portfolio younger while defending quarter. We must maintain our strength with our current consumers while adding the growing base of younger U.S. consumers. We are well-positioned to capture this growth opportunity by targeting our incredible brand portfolio of Hanes, Maidenform, Bali and more to reach unique consumer groups. We plan to invest to meet changing lifestyles with targeted and innovative products. Third, we're building e-comm excellence across all online channels. Consumers are rapidly adapting digital tools as a way to connect with our brands and buy our great products. To be successful over time, we must build our e-comm capabilities to serve consumers however they shop. We're leveraging data analytics to get to know our consumers better and build long-term loyalty. We're improving performance marketing, so consumers can find our products online, and we're developing a frictionless shopping experience to help consumers easily buy and receive our products, whether it's on our own sites or our retail partner sites. Finally, we're streamlining our portfolio and positioning for global growth. This will allow us to focus our resources and efforts on higher growth, higher margin businesses. As I mentioned earlier, we're moving on from PPE and we're exploring strategic alternatives for European Innerwear. With that overview of our growth opportunities, let me turn to the other key components of our plan. Setting the strategic initiatives and making the investments to unlock growth and create a more efficient and productive business model. We've already begun executing on a number of these, including a multi-year cost savings program intended to substantially self-fund our investments. We've identified 20 strategic initiatives each with its own leader, tactical team, KPIs and deliverable schedule. Well, I'm not going to run through all these initiatives today. Let me provide some high level thoughts. We'll be coming more consumer and product focus. We will lead with product design and innovation will elevate the discipline of brand and channel management, and we'll extend our sustainability heritage beyond our supply chain and into our brands and consumer marketing. We're optimizing data and modernizing our technology. Data and technology are key enablers for a number of our initiatives in our full potential plan. We're making data at tools through standardization and accessibility across the global organization. And we're investing in technology to make us more efficient both in terms of revenue optimization and cost management. We're segmenting our supply chain, so we can better serve our customers. Our supply chain is competitive advantage, and it's been a long standing strength of the company. Given our broad diversified portfolio of products, we're enhancing our capabilities to adapt to the changing environment and needs of the digital consumer. Segmenting our supply chain allows us to efficiently meet growth opportunities, deliver innovation, and be quicker to market for our respective innerwear and activewear businesses. And overtime, this should provide greater revenue opportunities while also lowering costs. And we're transforming our organization to speed up decision-making, align ourselves to deliver future growth and to build a winning culture. We're designing a flatter and more responsive organization around a global innerwear and global activewear structure. This will help us to leverage innovation, improve supply chain service and efficiency, and build powerhouse brands that meet the changing demands of our consumers and customers around the world. We're bringing in new capabilities and leadership. We've added outstanding new leaders, including our CHRO, our Chief Consumer Officer, and most recently our President of Global Innerwear. We've also restructured and reorganized a number of existing goals to drive alignment and to focus expertise on critical components of our full potential plant, particularly within supply chain and IT functions, all of which are designed to leverage and unleash the knowledge and expertise of our long tenured talent base. So to sum up, we're excited about the progress we made in the quarter. Revenue momentum continues to build across our business, which was evident in our strong fourth quarter performance. And we've begun implementing our full potential plan to drive growth and higher long-term profitability. This gives us confidence that we can build our business momentum in 2021 while also positioning the company for long-term success. We're looking forward to a more in-depth discussion about our growth strategy at our May Investor Day. And in closing, I'd like to once again thank the entire Hanesbrands team around the world for all your efforts in these challenging times. And with that, I'll turn the call over to T.C.
T.C. Robillard: Thanks, Steve. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?
Operator:  Our first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.
Omar Saad: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Nice quarter. I guess, Steven, my number one question would be, as you think about the full potential plan, and thanks for laying out some of the initial details and thoughts around that, maybe you could share some of the findings behind -- during the comprehensive review, the findings behind -- some of the key findings that are behind the plan, especially around the Champion brand? Thanks.
Steve Bratspies: Sure. Thanks for the question and appreciate you being on the call. When we started, really my first day, back in August to look at the business and really assess it, we did a real comprehensive review, and we looked at everything. We looked at how our brands are positioned, how we go to market, how the supply chain is performing, who are our key customers, what's our channel mix on a global basis. So, we took a very comprehensive look and really got to what we call kind of the unvarnished truth underneath our business. And every time you do that, of course, you learn things about your business, some things you're better at than you initially thought, things that you have big opportunities to improve upon. So, we looked at all that and the strategy that we built came right out of that. So, if think you about growing Champion, what we learned is - or what I learned is how strong the brand really is and how much potential it really has. And as I said in the last call, it's one of the reasons I joined the company because I think there's so much opportunity there when you think about the brand from its heritage. And this is a 100-year-old brand, it's got an incredible track record of innovation, it's got a really strong global footprint that's -- and continuing to grow. We're seeing a lot of excitement behind the brand. So, it's an area we need to lean into, and we need to continue to build upon. And I think the foundation is really strong, and the upside in the future is really good. The other really key growth area is the U.S. Innerwear business, and it's a business that's been inconsistent in terms of its growth, I would say, over the last couple years. And obviously it's a large part of our business, a very profitable part of the business. And as we look at our brands, really understanding where we are, what we learned is that our brands are tending to SKU a little old . And a lot of the growth in the category is coming younger, younger consumers shopping differently, looking for different products. So, we’re looking at our brand portfolio, and I love the brands that we have. I think in particular the Hanes brand is a bit underleveraged right now, and has massive opportunity to grow as we expand that. And we're going to spend a lot of time thinking about how do we segment each brand, have to have a very clear reason for being a very clear consumer segment that it's targeting, and capture a larger consumer base as we go forward. Just one example I'll give you, a thing that we learned, getting very granular. Look at the Hanes men's underwear business in the U.S., we have the number one share position in the over 35 age group, and we also have the number one share position in the under 35 age group, but the actual share is very different. We have a lot more share, absolute share in the over 35, and the growth is coming in the under 35. So we saw that as a big opportunity for us to understand that consumer a little bit better, how they're shopping, what products that they want. And we're going to be very focused and targeted on going after that consumer, and have had some products in the pipeline that are coming very soon that will enable us to capture that opportunity. One of the other key learnings I would say that we had was that I didn't think we were doing a good enough job leveraging our global learnings behind our brands and our consumers. So tie it back to that men's underwear example that I've just given you, our Australian business, particularly the Bonds brand, had gone through a very similar exercise just a couple years ago. They found themselves aging a little bit, and then pivoted, and now are doing extremely well capturing younger consumers with a bit of a different positioning, different brand -- different product offering over time, so there's a lot of learning inside this global company that we can build upon and improve upon, so that's one of the connection points that we're trying to make as we go forward. So, just a couple of the learnings that tie directly into key actions that we're taking going forward.
Omar Saad: Got it, that's super helpful. And then for a quick follow-up, did you guys provide the e-commerce and digital metrics this quarter? I know it's one of the strategic priorities building e-commerce excellence across channels. Thanks.
Steve Bratspies: Sure. We didn't in our release, but let me just talk a little bit about where we are from our, we call it, consumer-directed business. So from an online basis, it's about 21% of our sales and the quarter grew 46%. So, we're pretty pleased with the performance of that business over the year, and that was both with our third-party suppliers and with our sales in our own personal site. So, we continue to see momentum in the online business. Work to be done there, it's one of our strategic priorities. I think we can get a lot better. We're good, not great, and we need to improve upon that, but the consumer continues to find us, and we keep seeing momentum there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.
Paul Lejuez: Hey, thanks. I was just curious if you could, on the e-com business, if you could give those metrics on the company-owned piece of it excluding the third-party sites, just to follow-up on Omar's question there. And I wanted to understand a little bit more about the SKU reduction. I think you said 20% of SKUs, 12% of inventory. What percent of sales does that represent, and what won't we see from the brand, and is that happening more on the Champion side, more on the Innerwear side, if you could provide any help there? Thanks.
Steve Bratspies: Sure. Let me take them in reverse order, and let Scott talk a little bit about the online. From a SKU activity perspective, I think one of the things that's important is to understand kind of the context around why we did what we did. And it's really part of the initial full potential plan in the fourth quarter kickoff, is we took a number of actions to simplify our business. And simplify is a theme that you're going to hear from me a lot. I think it's really critical for us to be able to increase speed, lower costs, and create focus in our resources. And also, ultimately, that means provide our consumers with a better experience, whether that's in-stock, whether that's better products, whether that's better costs at the shelf. So, we're going to focus on simplification. And the SKU rationalization initiative is a key step in that. And it is about 20% of their SKUs that is -- that we took action on. It was about 12% of our inventory at the end of the year as we went forward. From a what-are-going-to-see, I don't -- I actually hope you don't see anything, in that you don't necessarily notice this. And I think that's kind of the intent, that you're not going to be a consumer who is now disappointed that they can't get Product X or they can't get Brand Y. When you think about SKU rationalization, it's this pruning. One, it's to reduce, but it's also to create room for other things, for newer areas so that we can drive growth. So, while we take 20% of our SKU out, we're still adding SKUs where it makes sense to our business for us to grow. But we took a very disciplined approach to the SKU reduction. I would bucket it into three areas for you. Some of it is just no regrets, there's some routine cleanup that needed to be done, small amount -- SKUs that have a small amount of inventory could be broken inventory, irregular, so you shouldn't see that at all. Others is some, what I would call, some unnecessary downstream complexity in packaging configurations or maybe some sub-brands or labels that are relatively small and are kind of declining businesses, legacy businesses that we wanted to clean up. And the third area is really kind of past season merchandise that we're continuing to replenish over time for certain customers, where we are really confident that we can move them into a more recent version of the product. So, we took a very disciplined approach. This was a global activity. All of our businesses were involved. We followed it in a very rigorous manner that got us to the 20%. But I don't see you looking at it and go, ""Oh, and now I'm missing this."" We intend this actually to accelerate growth in our system, to maybe allow us to move faster, and for us to improve margins over time. So, it should be seamless from a consumer perspective.
Scott Lewis: To your other question, and thanks for your question on this. So the online, to make sure I'm clearing your question of, well, adjusting online, as far as the growth there. It was about 21% of sales versus 16% last year, so we are seeing an incredible amount of growth as we -- as the consumer behaviors, shopping behaviors change and adapt. And so this is another area that as far as the full potential plan, we know there's a lot of opportunity with e-commerce and online. And so we have more capabilities that we're going to invest into as we really look for this as an opportunity to grow even more as we move forward.
Steve Bratspies: Yes. And I would just add that our owned Web sites are about 27% of our total online sales, so you can kind of get a feel for how important they are to us and the opportunity that they present for us going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Buckley with Bank of America.
David Buckley: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. I know we will hear more details in May, but just given the first quarter guide, do you believe you can return to fiscal '19 earnings level in 2021? And then can you share any details on the size and margin profile of the European Innerwear business? Thank you.
Scott Lewis: So, let me start off, and I appreciate your question. As far as the 2021, and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're not giving full 2021 guidance or an outlook at this time. We are still working through and developing our full potential plan, and we look forward to addressing that fully in the May Investor Day. And so, as we think about the first quarter, again we're really encouraged about the momentum that we're spending within the business across all of our segments. And we're seeing that -- we saw that momentum continue into January and we feel really good about the first quarter based on what we've seen so far. And as we think about going down the P&L from a margin perspective, looking for pretty substantial margin accretion there both from a gross profit and a SG&A standpoint, as we continue to have top-line growth we're really able to leverage the fixed costs in the SG&A.
Steve Bratspies: And I agree with that, Scott. I think we're seeing good momentum in the business and we feel good about heading into 2021. In terms of our European Innerwear business, I'll give you just a little bit of color. We're at the very early stages, so we don't have a lot to share in terms of process, but we wanted to just to let you know that we're started to process and our commitment to being transparent with you, but just a few details overview of the business. In 2020 it's a $500 million to $600 million in sales, the corporate operating -- the average operating margin is a bit below than the corporate average. It's largely a wholesale business, but it does have some online retail with it. The biggest countries we operate in are France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the business has some great brands. And if you're familiar with that market, the DIM brand in France, Nur Die in Germany, Abanderado in Spain, Lovable in Italy are really good brands. We've got a very strong team over there, but for us this is just we have finite resources and we are focusing on where we think we can generate the best long-term return. So it's a good business, but we're just questioning that is it a right business for us right now? So we started this process and we'll keep you in the loop as more developed.
David Buckley: Thank you. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.
Adrienne Yih: Good morning. Yes, let me add my congratulations. Steve thanks for all the color. My first question is actually, how are you viewing some of the opportunities sort of the -- some of these digitally native brands have sort of offered up. It seems like they are making a pretty good connection with the Millennial, whether it's ThirdLove or something really small and nascent like a Tommy John. So that's my first question is somatically. And then my second question is for Scott on the manufacturing variants aspect does this SKU reduction in any way, the SKU reduction combined with the non-go-forward PPE. Will that have any impact on the manufacturing variants and kind of along with that, are you replacing sort of the non-go-forward SKUs with more innovation? Thank you very much.
Steve Bratspies: Let me talk about the digitally native brands first. Yes, there's a lot of them out there and they are some interesting. Obviously, we watch them very closely and learn from them and understand how they're attracting consumers and what they can do. I look at it versus our brand portfolio where we have really strong brands in the business, whether that's Hanes, whether that's Bally, whether that's Maidenform. The challenge for us going forward in the work that we're doing right now is to make sure that we do a very clear segmentation and positioning of each one of these brands. One of the challenges that we have is I think in many times, our brands overlap a little bit too much and are too close to each other, and we need to push them apart, segment them and position them to capture the younger consumer. And I think we have the capability to do that. And we're seeing the momentum with our broad business being up double-digits in the last quarter. We're already starting to implement a few things that have been underway, but there's more to be done, but I think we're -- we have the brands that we need right now to position it. We need to improve our e-commerce presence and performance that we talked about earlier. We need to make sure we have the right innovation, but we look forward to growing that business. And I think we're well positioned to do it. We have work to do, but I think we have the assets in place that we need.
Scott Lewis: Good morning. Thanks for your question. In regard to the SKU reduction and manufacturing capacity, we do not anticipate any manufacturing kind of variance a drag as we go into next year, or just recall back when COVID emerged and we did supply chain down. And the PPE business was able to absorb and kind of take on that capacity in the interim. And if things ramped backup we were back to full capacity as we kind of work through the rest of the year. So we did have some manufacturing variances in the second-half of the year with an international and active way or, and we talked about that in the last quarter's call and we saw that play out in the fourth quarter. But again that was a short-term drag, and as we go into 2021 that'll be behind us.
Steve Bratspies: And I would just add to that, the idea we're going to be adding new SKUs. The answer is yes. We're looking at adding, we're trying to not - you know, we're obviously not going to raise our SKU count back to where we were in the past. So we're going to be constantly be adding and pruning and managing as we go forward. But we're looking to add SKUs to drive growth and more newness in our assortment, whether and there's different ways of doing that, some is just new products that we event, some of it is back to being a global company, how do we lift in land global styles and share on a more global basis, I think we have an opportunity to be more seasonally relevant with color and print rotations, different silhouettes and fabrications we're looking at for the younger consumers. So the 20% reduction gives us room in our operating model to do more, it simplifies our manufacturing process, it simplifies our distribution process, and allows us to be focused on where the true growth opportunities are. So we're looking to grow. And we'll definitely add SKUs as we need to.
Scott Lewis: And just one more point on the SKU reduction, and Steve was just pointing out the efficiencies again, efficiencies will help drive down costs, actually with some of the SKUs that we identified with lower performing and shorter runtimes. And so we're able to kind of offset that with core higher volume SKUs. So I would expect anything will be more efficient over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Exane BNP Paribas.
Laurent Vasilescu: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Steve, Scott, could you possibly give us some direction on where Champion should grow for first quarter? And then I think last quarter, you talked about Spring Summer bookings to be higher than 2019 levels for Champion. Is that still the case and then second question, just how did we think about the U.S. Activewear EBIT margin since it was down 700 bps for the fourth quarter? How do we think about it for the first quarter? Thank you very much.
Steve Bratspies: Sure, Scott you start with the margin first.
Scott Lewis: Sure, definitely and Laurent, thanks for your question. So from an Activewear margin standpoint, and actually overall for the for the quarter, we're actually pleased with Activewear's results and from a margin perspective, we talked about this on the last call, we expected margins to be down in the fourth quarter with, we had some manufacturing variances that were unfavorable, that were incurred early in the year. And now we're flowing through in the second-half. And so that was negatively impacting our margins for the Activewear business. Now, those are short-term headwinds that we had. And as we move into 2021, that's going to be behind us. And so that's going to be a good rebounding from a margin perspective, from Activewear as we go into 2021. And then it can just weighing on top of that as volumes and top line increases in growth there, we're going to be able to spread cost even more so simply get a margin expanding back to where it was before.
Steve Bratspies: Good morning, Laurent. In terms of Champion, we're feeling really good about the business and where it's going. And yes, bookings continue to be up and strong as we go forward and we're expecting good performance from Champion in the first quarter. The big headwind that we had that we talked about in the third quarter was around our sports and college licensing business. And as activities are muted, and people aren't attending events and college bookstores are closed, that obviously remains a headwind for us. But when you look at the quarter, and you look at Global Champion being 11%, and then up 18%, when you back out the challenge, sports and college licensing business, you can see the impact there, but we feel good about Champion in the quarter, we think we're going to continue to have momentum, and consumers really reacting, innovation is working. And the channels are working for us as well. So we're very bullish on Champion going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.
Michael Binetti: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for all the details today. I guess jump all, could you speak to the guidance for the first quarter started focused on the near-term for a minute, but it points to an operating margin that's above the first quarter of 2019. Steve, lot of us are trying to model to pre-COVID levels. So I'm trying to think, maybe you can help us with gross margin versus SG&A in the first quarter, just so we can think about how those businesses or how those lines compared to the first quarter of '19 as well. And is that being above those margins, is that the sustainable dynamic as we try to roll through the next few quarters after 1Q understanding that you don't want to guide us yet for the full-year. I'm just trying to get a better picture of what this business looks like. On the other side, and then Steve, when you look at the potential options early on in the strategy to exit the Europe business, is the comment that you can self-fund these transformation initiatives. Does that assume that you have these savings initiatives that you're looking at have enough savings to offset any potential dilution from the Europe business? I'm assuming there're some stranded costs or even though it's got you said it's got margins below the corporate average?
Steve Bratspies: Sure, let me go first and then Scott can go back. So yes, we're kicking-off a very substantial cost savings initiative that we think can help transform our cost structure over time and substantially self fund our investments separate from any changes we made to our portfolio, I want you to think about the investments or the self funding of the investments, real cost savings initiative, kind of our ongoing base business. And I think you should include that in 2021, as you think about your modeling, those cost savings to start today and our investments start today. So I think you can connect those in 2021 as we go forward, HEI and depending upon, sorry, when I refer to HEI, our European Innerwear business, that's our internal word. Sorry about that. Our European innerwear business, we'll see where that goes. And as I said, it's early, but that would be separate from our cost savings initiative. It's not, that's not how we're tending to fund investments going forward.
Scott Lewis: Excellent. And good morning, thanks for your question on our Q1 guidance and let me kind of first step back, I know you're asking about the margins, so I think it's important to understand kind of a broader view of kind of what we're looking at from a top perspective, that's actually drive margin performance as well. Again, like I said earlier, we off to a strong start to 2021, we have some really good momentum across the business, and you can see that in our actually in our segment top line guidance with double-digit growth expected for U.S. Innerwear both in U.S. Activewear and International, we're expecting mid to high single-digit growth in the first quarter, that can really continue on the underlying momentum that we saw in the second-half. Now with that being said, we're still facing the unknown. So we have continuing headwinds from COVID and some operational challenges, but again, we're very overall very optimistic as we go into 2021 on a margin perspective, I think we're anticipating a big bump as far as profit improvement of 550 basis points over the first quarter of last year. And I think it's important to understand when you're comparing the 2020, of course it's lightened always, in 2020 in the first quarter of last year, I guess some COVID charges that we incurred. The first part was in gross margin when we had a $12 million negative manufacturing variance from sending our supply chain down back in March timeframe, and that started for a couple of months. And we also had a bankruptcy charge, which were to a retail customer of $11 million. So those two things were in the margin last year that would not repeat for the first quarter of this year not anticipating, the balance of the improvement is in mix between gross profit and SG&A and going back to the SKU reduction initiatives, we're actually seeing the benefits already in the first quarter of that, we're expecting lower excess and obsolete inventory charges. And we're also anticipating the savings from the supply chain restructuring acts as we've done recently, as well. So we're seeing savings closer to the P&L now, we're going to have some incremental costs, as you think about the first quarter. Like I mentioned, we have some operational challenges and things are widespread, supply chain logistics constraints that that the industry-wide are saying the port congestion and product availability issues and an impact of this a little bit in Q4, but also is going to continue through the first quarter. And that includes incremental costs like higher freight, and some repackaging costs where we're trying to leverage existing inventory, repackaging that to meet customer demand, to kind of work through that and meet deadlines there. From an SG&A perspective, it's really mostly about just leveraging the top line growth and leveraging those fixed costs and getting the higher kind of spreading that cost over a larger sales volume.
Steve Bratspies: So and I would just add on top of all that. So Scott, that's really good kind of where we're today. But, as we kick-off the full potential plan, and we work towards this, and when we get together in May, our Investor Day, we'll share a much longer-term view of it. But our goal and our intent is to be a higher growth, more consistent growth company that delivers higher levels of profitability over time. So we're building a long-term plan that enables that, and we feel like we're going to have a good story to tell you when we get together in May, and we'll be able to put all the pieces together to show you how we get there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Susan Anderson with B. Riley.
Susan Anderson: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the performance of C9 and Amazon into the quarter, I guess, how is the consumer resonating with the brand and how is it performing versus your expectations?
Steve Bratspies: Sure. Good morning, Susan. C9, our full-year sales were in line with our expectations. We're focused on Amazon right now. We're looking at business in total as part of our Global Champion brand strategy and it's really trying to understand where we can drive Champion and how C9 fits into that strategy as we go forward. We do know that there's still good consumer equity and loyalty in the brand and we're looking to see how we manage that in the long-term, but to answer your question directly, it's performing to our expectations on Amazon and what they expect and what we expect going forward, and both are pleased with the business.
Susan Anderson: Great. And then just like to add a follow-up, I'm curious how you're thinking about the long-term growth of the segments particularly innerwear, which is just inherently a lower growth business, I guess after we get past the restocking, how are you thinking about kind of the more normalized growth levels for that segment of the business? Thanks.
Steve Bratspies: Yes, I'm not going to give you what the long-term number is for our growth right now. What I would tell you is yes, traditional innerwear in total has been modest growth business, but there are segments of the business that are growing much faster than others. And one of the things that we've done in our assessment of the business is really go back in and understand what product categories, what consumer groups, ages, channels, demographics are growing. And we have much more granular understanding of that today than we've had in the past. And I think what we need to do, and what we will do is we will target those opportunities specifically so that there is growth underneath. And when you pull back the covers and the key is to be able to have the right brands, the right products, the right pricing structure, the right channel approach to go after those opportunities. So, our plan is to have consistent growth into our business particularly our U.S. innerwear business going forward, which will be an inflection point for the company as we move forward, and in May, we'll talk a little bit more about that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.
Paul Trussell: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the color. I guess wanted to maybe just see if there is any additional information you can provide around what you've seen year-to-date. You spoke about momentum across the business. In 4Q, maybe just more specifically on what you're seeing from the different divisions and the different geographies particularly Europe quarter-to-date?
Steve Bratspies: Sure. Good morning, Paul. Yes, in total, we feel good about the business and the performance you saw it in Q4, consistent performance across the business, whether that was innerwear, activewear and strengthen our international business in total that was driven by champion, and our Australia, our business is really performing and we're very pleased with that business. And we appointed a new leader there, Tanya Deans is going to take that business to the next level for us. We feel really good about that. Europe and Asia are headwinds, and we're headwinds in the fourth quarter particularly Europe with a lot of - there is closings, there is openings, it's moving back and forth, but that's been a bit of a headwind for us. In the innerwear business, the champion business in Europe has held up, it's held up well, and we're pleased with that performance. And we continue to see that performing over time, but European the challenge and Asia is a challenge in total, there is different parts. Japan was a very big headwind last year. We are starting to see a little potentially some good news coming out of Japan of some opening, but that certainly was a headwind. But the other side of Asia, in China, we like where overheaded with Champion business and our partnerships there to build both online and physical retail in China with a Champion Business, so the portfolio it's mixed around the globe and it's really a week-to-week type environment to understand, government closings where the spikes and cases and things like that. The good news for us is, I feel like we're managing through it very well. The supply chain has held up very well through this and our ability that one - we have manufacturing different places around the world, controlling a lot of our own supply chain has helped and allowed us probably to provide better service maybe then some of our competition, which certainly helped us and for some longer-term space gains as we go forward. So I think the organization is managing through it. I'd be remiss if I don't take a second and thank our entire organization for the really hard work that they put in the last year and continued to put in to position us to be successful in a difficult environment. So I feel good about where we are and we continue to manage it very closely and we have all the processes and controls in place to make sure that we can drive in a very challenged difficult environment.
Paul Trussell: Appreciate it. And then on PPE, I certainly understand the strategic thought process. Maybe could you just remind us or give us some numbers to kind of think about as you cycle that business year-over-year, what was the impact to the P&L from a top line and EBIT contribution standpoint over the last 12 months?
Steve Bratspies: Sure, appreciate you following up on that. Paul, if the PPE one, this is challenging one for us, obviously. We have finite resources accompany and it's, we really want to focus and we see the best growth opportunity and the market's changed. Back in the third quarter, we did just under $180 million of sales in Q4 it was $28 million. So it's declined pretty significantly. Sales trends have changed. As I mentioned, competitions difference, consumers changing what they're looking for and the type of product is a lot more novelty and different things like that. And it's not where we want to go. In terms of the impact, in sales it was roughly a billion dollars for the total year, which is obviously a big number, but I would tell you, while we're writing it down and it was a big sales contributor in 2020, we don't see it as a headwind in 2021 from a sales perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.
Jay Sole: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So Steve, I just want to clarify something from one of your earlier questions. When you say that the multi-year cost savings program is intended to substantially self-fund the investments necessary, what exactly do you mean by substantial? Does that mean like entirely, do you'll cover the cost of investments with the cost savings or there'll be some incremental investments on top of the cost savings? And then secondly, when you think about R&D in advertising, traditionally R&D is maybe 50 bids of total sales, advertising a little bit less than 3% of total sales. With the cost savings program, do you intend to take those percentages higher? Can you just tell us where you see those two line items within the P&L moving? Thank you.
Steve Bratspies: Sure. Let me take the questions in reverse order. So in terms of R&D and advertising, I think we have an opportunity to invest there. And I think we have an opportunity to spend more particularly in advertising. If you look back historically back to 2013 to 2015, we spent in the 3.2%, 3.5% range, 17% to 19% that was down in the low twos. And then this last year we were at about two. Now, 2020 is a different year. So there's a lot going on there, but I think we're under spending in corporate advertising as percent of sales. And it varies by brand. It varies by part of the world that we're in. But fundamentally, I think we have an opportunity to have our brands work harder for us and do more and expect for us to invest in that. And a lot of that comes along with R&D. Product development is a big opportunity for us as we go forward. So you should look for us to invest in those areas as we go forward. In terms of substantially self-fund our investments. I don't know the exact number at this point to be perfectly and honest with you, I know we're going to be making investments. I know we have line of sight to some significant cost reduction opportunities over time, and this is going to be a journey, it's going to be a couple of years to get there. Will we get -- will we be able to self-fund a 100% of it. I don't know. At this point, our goal is to self-fund as much of it as we possibly can. And we think we will be able to self-fund a substantial portion of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.
Ike Boruchow: Hey, everyone. Just two quick ones for me, one in the first quarter, basically got the share count is guided to come up by a couple of million. Just kind of curious, what's going on there. And then Steve, maybe I'm not understanding. Can you clarify when you're saying the PPE was a billion dollars and you're wrapping it without that revenue recurring, but you don't view that as a headwind. I'm just not sure -- I'm understanding how you describe the end?
Steve Bratspies: Sure. Let me start with the PPE. It was about a bit of billion dollars, when I say it wasn't headwind. I think we'll be able to lap it with our base business and our current business as we go forward. So it's obviously a big number, but we see the opportunity as markets open up to cover that billion dollars of sales that we had from that category.
Scott Lewis: And from a of our account standpoint, we're not anticipating any, any large fluctuations in our share price or the stock outstanding shares. Really the function of a share count can be a mix of stock price. We also have our long-term incentive plan is share base. So as you have grants and best things that tends to conduct the share price and the outstanding shares kind of fluctuate over the year, but nothing significant to call out.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen.
John Kernan: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Steve, maybe just on U.S. Innerwear in the back-half even the ex PPA sales organic growth a much better than trend in the first-half and certainly on a multi-year basis, so maybe talk to the specific drivers of what is producing the better organic growth in Innerwear. And then just on the competitive dynamics within the category. What are your views? What's your view on private label? You didn't talk earlier a little bit about some of the D2C brands. What's your view on the overall competitive environment with private label?
Steve Bratspies: Sure. In terms of innerwear and the momentum that we have there, there's a couple of things going on. Obviously there was particularly in Q3 lot of restocking going on and the momentum behind, we got some benefit out of that. In Q4, there will be probably a little bit going forward. But, obviously that starts to wane over time as everyone catches up. We see good POS performance; consumers pulling the products. And some of that's from space gains that the team has had. Some of it's through I think we simplified our assortment in certain accounts that has really helped us improve the points. And our inventory in stock has been pretty good from a relative perspective. So, executing the fundamentals of the business in the innerwear has helped us. And I think it's an opportunity for us going forward. I still think we can get a lot better at it. And as we add new products and as we execute the fundamentals and the basics for business well, we should see momentum and growth there. In terms of private label, it's a competitive category. And we are looking at all the different brands. But being the top brand and the top share brand, it's a good position to be in. And, I have mentioned this before but for me private label is something we need to think about, but we need to our jobs as brands and as brand leaders. And we do the right thing for our brand, we are producing high quality products that consumers want, when we manage price gaps and we have a reasonable price and good value which we should be able to do from our low cost manufacturing, we continue to invest in our brand the way we need to, I think we'll hold up extremely well versus the private label environment. Retailers want brands like Hanes like BALI, like Maidenform to drive traffic to their stores. That's why they have brand so that people come into the stores. So, our part of that equation is to make sure that we are innovating, that we are messaging back to the advertising discussion we just had a minute ago. We are getting our message out that we are making our brands incredibly relevant and brands that we in desire, and if do that, we drive traffic to retailers and retailers are happy with the business over time. So, we need to act like the leading brands that we are and put the foundation behind that. And if we do that, I think we will compete very well with private label along with the all the other brands that are out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.
Jim Duffy: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to start by congratulating HanesBrands organization on A List recognition for sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint. Great work there guys.
Steve Bratspies: Thank you.
Jim Duffy: Steven, I think that HanesBrands has having being the process of tightening the belt over a number of year period, what are the further areas where you find savings to fund the investment that you are talking about? Can you highlight some of the opportunities? And then, Scott, I know you are not giving guidance for '21, but can you share thoughts on tax rate given the changing business mix going forward? And then Scott, what's behind the increase in accrued liabilities in the fourth quarter?
Steve Bratspies: Let me start. Jim, first of all thank you for the recognition and the callout. And sustainability is something that is very important to us. Something that we are very proud off and something that's yearly ingrained in the DNA of the company, and we're going to continue to do and strive and continue to improve in that place. And I think you are going to see us start to talk about it more and ingrained into our brand. It's ingrained in the company. We're going to ingrain it in our brands going forward which is an opportunity for us to be increasingly relevant to younger consumers over time. In terms of cost program that you talked about, Hanes has had a lot of programs over time in the past. And I have learnt a lot about those and the approach we have taken. Here's what I say is the difference to you is in the past, a lot of the cost reduction programs have just being about reducing cost. And they are kind of isolated programs. This cost reduction program is going to be tied into the full potential plan. And it's integrated into strategies and all the initiatives -- the 20 initiatives that we talked about have helped find savings over time. So, it's not just -- it works horizontally across the organization finding lots of different opportunities from how we are going to work differently. This is about changing the work and that enables us to reduce cost over time. But we are looking at all the big buckets. I mean look at P&L, the big buckets are around SG&A. And we are looking at all the non-labor activities around SG&A and obviously part of COVID changes how we think about operating our business going forward. There will be some opportunities there. Our labor model, as we think about segmenting the supply chain and going to market differently and serving consumers differently. And then, the other big line is obviously cost of goods. So, we are doing a really in-depth look at sourcing and procurement optimization, how do we get more efficient. But, we're doing it through the lens of full potential plan. It's not a standalone cost initiative. And, I think that's what really makes it different, and that's what's going to unlock a lot of cost for us going forward.
Scott Lewis: Thanks for your question. So, on the tax rate, and we are expecting a 16% tax rate in the first quarter, not at this time, I can give you anything on the full-year, but we're always working with our advisors to really try to optimize our tax rates just under the rules and regulations that exists, again that can ebb and flow a little bit over the time, as you mentioned, the mix of income, but we always try to kind of manage that from year-to-year. From the standpoint of accrued liabilities, it's really more of a function of the strong fourth quarter results that's driving the accrued liabilities up, you have the higher sales volumes that creates higher trade incentive accruals at the end of the year, higher taxes payable at the end of the year. That's really largely a portion of what's driving our balance there, anything off from just timing items that contend to go back and forth over the year, but that's really what's driving is the higher performance in Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta with C.L. King Associates.
Steve Marotta: Good morning, Steve and Scott, and T.C. very one quick question, Steven, regarding the e-commerce excellence, one of the challenges in the owned DTC channel over the years has been shipping costs versus lower average AURs for Hanesbrands. How do you think about that going forward in particular, by the way, in the recent season when shipping costs have increased, have you cracked the code there? If not, how do you think that code will be cracked going forward?
Steve Bratspies: Sure. It's a great question. And the short answer is no, I don't think we've cracked the code on how to do that yet, and it's something that, obviously we're thinking about as we build out both our owned e-commerce and partner with our third-parties. Shipping costs are a major part of the P&L. So, we have to be smart about fuse, and how we offer pack sizes and how we go to market on that. But I would tell you, it's not something we've solved at this point necessarily differently from all of our other competitors that everyone is struggling with as we go forward, but as we build this business, we're building it through the lens of how do we do it in the most profitable sense, from SKU assortment, what's our SLA that we want to have over time, we're looking at all of those different things. But it's work to be done as we build that e-commerce excellence, because that's certainly a headwind that everyone faces. And we have to understand exactly how we want to play and where we want to play on that paradigm. It's not something that we've necessarily locked in on or figured out yet at this point.
Steve Marotta: That's helpful. I'll take the balance of my questions offline. Thanks.
Steve Bratspies: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to T.C. Robillard for closing remarks.
T.C. Robillard: We would like to thank everyone for attending our call today and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
