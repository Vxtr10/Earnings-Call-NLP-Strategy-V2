The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changed assumptions or other factors. Now, let's hear from Donald Colvin, our CFO, who will provide an overview of first quarter 2008 results, Donald?
Donald Colvin: Thank you, Ken, and thanks to everyone who is joining us today. ON Semiconductor Corporation today announced their total revenues in the first quarter of 2008 were $421.9 million, an increase of approximately 3% from the fourth quarter of 2007. Total revenues during the quarter included approximately $396.4 million of standalone ON Semiconductor revenues and approximately $25.5 million of revenues from the acquisition of AMIS Holdings, Inc. that closed on March 17, 2008. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company reported GAAP net income of $20.8 million, or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis. First quarter of 2008 GAAP net income included net charges of $44.6 million, or $0.14 per share on a fully diluted basis from special items. First quarter 2008 non-GAAP total net income was $65.4 million, or $0.21 per share on a fully diluted basis. On a mix-adjusted basis, average selling prices in the first quarter of 2008 were down less than 2% from the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company's total gross margin in the first quarter was 34.7%. Non-GAAP total gross margin in the first quarter of 2008 was 37.6%. Excluding the impact of the AMIS acquisition, ON Semiconductor had standalone gross margin of approximately 35.7% in the first quarter of 2008. Stand alone non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was 37%. ON Semiconductor stand alone GAAP gross margin in the first quarter included a net charge of approximately $5.1 million or 130 basis points from special items. On a stand alone basis, first quarter 2008 gross margin was also impacted by the increase in overall manufacturing costs associated with the weak dollar and increases in direct material costs as anticipated. First quarter stand alone ON Semiconductor non-GAAP net income excluding the acquisition of AMIS was $59.2 million, or $0.20 per share on a fully diluted basis. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $97.2 million. During the first quarter, the Company retired AMIS Holdings' $277 million senior bank facility. After paying off this $277 million of bank facility, we exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $308 million or approximately $33 million more than the fourth quarter of 2007. This includes cash acquired at the closing of the AMIS transaction. At the end of the first quarter, total days sales outstanding were approximately 53 days. The increase in day sales outstanding was due to the acquisition of AMIS. In the second quarter, day sales outstanding should normalize in the 40-day range. ON Semiconductor standalone inventory was approximately $224 million, or 80 days. The acquisition of AMIS added approximately $142 million of inventory. Of the $142 million of inventory, approximately $66 million was associated with the write-up to fair value. Based on our second quarter 2008 non-GAAP guidance and adjusting for the $66 million write-up of inventories due to the purchase accounting rules, we would expect that our normalized inventory days should be less than 85 days at the end of the second quarter. Our objective is to run the combined businesses at approximately 78 to 82 days of inventory valued at standard costs. Distribution inventories were down to approximately 10.5 weeks at the end of the first quarter. Cash capital expenditures during the first quarter were approximately $16 million. Now I would like to turn it over to Keith Jackson for additional comments on the business environment, Keith?
Keith Jackson: Thanks, Don. Now, for an overview of our standalone ON Semiconductor end-markets. During the first quarter of 2008, we saw strong growth in our computing end-market, which grew by approximately 5% sequentially and represented 29% of our stand alone ON Semiconductor product sales. The growth in this end-market was helped by our acquisition of the CPU Voltage and PC Thermal Products Group from Analog Devices. During the first quarter, we also saw strength in our stand alone automotive, industrial and networking end-markets. Our standalone automotive end-market revenues grew sequentially by approximately $4 million in the first quarter and represented approximately 17% of stand alone product sales. Industrial represented approximately 12% of product sales and networking grew by approximately $4 million sequentially in the first quarter of 2008 and represented approximately 7% of ON Semiconductor stand alone product sales. In the first quarter of 2008, we saw a slow down in our stand alone Consumer Electronics and Wireless end-markets as anticipated. The Consumer Electronics and Wireless end-markets represented approximately 20% and 15% of the first quarter 2008 ON Semiconductor standalone product sales, respectively. In the Wireless end-market, we saw a significant slowdown from sales to indigenous Chinese handset manufacturers during the quarter, and in the Consumer Electronics end-market, we saw a seasonal slowdown in applications such as MP3 player, game consoles and TVs. During the first quarter on a direct billings basis, no standalone ON Semiconductor product OEM customer was more than 5% of product sales and our top five stand alone product OEM customers were Continental Automotive Systems, Delta, LG Electronics, Motorola and Samsung. On a geographic basis, our contribution this quarter from ON Semiconductor stand alone product sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were down 100 basis points and represented approximately 64% of product sales. Our product sales in the Americas were flat at approximately 17% of product sales. Sales in Europe were up approximately 100 basis points and represented approximately 16% of product sales during the quarter, and sales in Japan were flat at approximately 3% of product sales. Looking across the channels, sales to the distribution channel were up by 200 basis points to approximately 52% of ON Semiconductor Standalone product sales. Direct sales to OEMs were decreased by approximately 100 basis points to approximately 39% of product sales, and the EMS channel decreased by approximately 100 basis points to 9% of product sales. During the first quarter, ON Semiconductor stand alone product revenues broken out by divisions were as follows. The Standard Products Group represented approximately 32% of product sales. The Automotive and Power Regulation Group represented approximately 28% of product sales. The Computing Products Group represented approximately 29% of product sales, and the Digital and Consumer Products Group represented approximately 11% of product sales. We will publish the quarterly revenue, gross margin, and operating margin break out of these divisions in our 10Q filing. Now, I'd like to provide you with some details on other progress we have made. The first quarter of 2008 marks the next phase in the successful transformation of ON Semiconductor. Since December, we have closed on two critical acquisitions that expand our mindshare and market share with leading customers in the automotive, computing, industrial, military and aerospace and medical end markets. We are already seeing the benefits from these acquisitions of utilizing ON Semiconductor's historical strengths in manufacturing, operations, supply chain and sales channels. We are on track to see over $20 million of revenue from our acquisition of the CPU Voltage and PC Thermal Products Group from Analog Devices in the third quarter of this year. These acquired products greatly expand our presence in the computing end-market and specifically with leading notebook customers. The AMIS acquisition, which closed on March 17, accelerates our Analog transformation and rebalances our end-market exposure. The AMIS acquisition expands our engineering, field application and design resources by over 300 people. As promised, we are also delivering on our synergy targets. Since the transaction closed, we already exited the first quarter with a run rate of approximately $6 million in quarterly synergies and are on track to exit this year with synergies north of $12 million on a quarterly basis or approximately $50 million on an annual basis entering 2009. I am also happy to announce that the acquisition is accretive to non-GAAP net income per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2008. In the computing end-market, we continue to see strong growth of our power management products and integrated solutions including power factor controllers, regulators, multi-phase controllers and MOSFET drivers for desktop, notebook and power supply markets. Our acquisition of Analog Devices CPU Voltage and PC Thermal Monitoring Business has significantly expanded our SAM opportunities. The first quarter of 2008, represented the highest quarterly revenue in the computing end-market in the Company's history and our new power management design wins position us for strong growth in the second half of this year. We've expanded our design wins substantially on the latest generation of desktop motherboards and have moved into a leadership position in desktop power management. As demand for notebook computers increase, we are also well positioned in our Vcore controllers, thermal managers, power regulators and MOSFET families to maximize growth and continue to provide solutions to our customers that optimize battery life and efficiently manage computer peripherals. We are expecting to see significant growth in our notebook power management business in the second half of this year from our new design wins on the most recent notebook platform. In the automotive market, our revenue was up approximately 7% sequentially driven by our continued penetration of infotainment platforms in autos. With our recently acquired custom capabilities from AMI, we can now better service our automotive customers in virtually every major system from power train and safety to lighting and infotainment applications. Wireless end market in the first quarter was down sequentially as expected primarily due to regional softness with the China indigenous customers. As we look into the second quarter, we are beginning to see stabilization in the region's customers. On the positive side, we continue to see expansion of revenue opportunity with four of the five leading global handset vendors driven by our analog switch and circuit protection products and solutions. In the consumer end market, incremental design wins and production ramps in products from GPS navigation to LCD and Digital TV's are expected to contribute to our future growth. Solutions including our new GreenPoint power supply reference design for the digital to analog converter boxes help enable designers to meet the governmental and regulatory requirements of the upcoming conversion from analog to digital TV signals. Our products and solutions continue to win awards within the industry. We recently won first place in the Digital ASSP category of EDN's 18th annual Innovation Awards for our Ezairo Hearing Aid IC, a product from our recent acquisition of AMI. We also continue to win service awards from our customers and global partners including recent awards from customers such as Murata, Asustek-Pegatron and Bennywave, with multi-year Best Supplier awards being awarded from ZTE and Longcheer. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Donald for other comments and our other forward-looking guidance, Donald?
Donald Colvin: Thank you, Keith. Second Quarter 2008 outlook. Based upon product booking trends, backlog levels, anticipated manufacturing services revenue decline of approximately $8 million sequentially and estimated turns levels, we anticipate that total revenues will be approximately $545 million to $560 million in the second quarter of 2008. Included in our total revenue guidance, is the expectation of sequential product revenue growth of approximately 2% to 6% for ON Semiconductor stand alone, and approximately $150 million of revenue associated with the completed acquisition of AMIS. Backlog levels at the beginning of the second quarter of 2008 were up from backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of 2008 and represent over 85% of our anticipated second quarter 2008 revenues. We expect that average selling prices for the second quarter of 2008 will be down approximately 2% sequentially. We expect cash capital expenditures of approximately $40 million in the second quarter, total cash capital expenditures of approximately $130 million for the year. This includes cash capital expenditures from acquisition of AMIS. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP gross margin of approximately 32% to 34%. Our GAAP gross margin in the second quarter will be impacted from the write-up of inventories to fair market value associated with the acquisition of AMIS. We also expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 40% to 41.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes special items of approximately $42 million to $44 million. For the second quarter we also expect total GAAP operating expenses of approximately $136 million to $141 million or approximately 25% of sales, with GAAP SG&A expenses at 12% to 13% and R&D expenses at 11% to 12%. We also expect total non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $124 million to $128 million or approximately 23%. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude special items of approximately $12 million to $13 million. We anticipate that net interest expense will be approximately $9 million for the second quarter of 2008 and cash taxes to be approximately $4 million. As a reminder, we have over $800 million of net operating losses in the U.S. and expect our cash taxes to average less than $5 million a quarter for the next two years. Taking into account the build up of cash balances over time in the U.S. and offshore, our projected effective tax rate should be approximately 10% to 12% after 2010. We also project to have ample cash to meet our U.S. debt amortization requirement. Our current fully diluted share count is approximately 410 million shares based on stock prices below $10, which includes approximately 396 million of common stock and approximately 14 million shares related to options, convertibles and restricted stock units. Further details on share count and EPS calculations are provided regularly in our 10Qs and Ks. With that, I'd like to start the question-and-answer session.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Craig Ellis of Citi.
Craig Ellis: Thanks, and good morning, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. The first question, Keith, you mentioned the synergies that you are already starting to harvest, can you just give us a little more color on where that's coming from whether it be cost of goods or the operating expense lines?
Keith Jackson: It comes from both. Right now the first couple of weeks that are reported in this quarter, that was more from OpEx savings than COGS, but as we get through the end of the year, I expect the COGS line will be the dominant line –
Craig Ellis: Okay. And then as the follow question, we've been looking for the Gresham fab to ramp up with on product this year. Keith, can you give us an update on how we should look at we think about 2Q through 4Q?
Keith Jackson: Yes. It should continue to ramp. We have gotten now two of our analog processes in there and we are indeed adding new products every day from the ON portfolio. And so, it's on track from the last comments I made. The acquisitions from AMIS and ADI really kick in Q1. So, everything we've put forward before on the on basis remains intact.
Craig Ellis: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Berger of FBR Capital Markets.
Craig Berger: Hey, guys, good morning.
Keith Jackson: Good morning.
Craig Berger: Nice job. A few questions here. First of all, on the PC side it looks like even excluding the ADI acquisition that business was flatter, slightly up sequentially in Q1. Could you tell us what's driving that and also talk about some of your SEC investments or Solutions Engineering Center?
Keith Jackson: Sure. Yes, we continue to gain share basically in computing without question. In the desktop, we are expecting to have the significant majority of next-generation motherboards that will be ramping in the second half for our Vcore Controllers and continued good penetration on all the other products. So, we are actually pretty excited about that and so, it was flat up for the base business and that was entirely new designs ramping. The SECs have been very successful for us. I'm very excited about that. In each of the areas we put those, the design win count in the new products that flow into those markets have accelerated dramatically. We'll be talking about some of those specifics in numbers in our Analyst Day upcoming presentations.
Craig Berger: And then just as a follow up, can you tell us how much cost savings is assumed in your 2Q guidance in COGS and OpEx so we can understand where we are at, what's assumed, and how much we can model on a go forward basis beyond the second quarter?
Donald Colvin: It's Donald here. Obviously, as we integrate both the manufacturing structures and the OpEx structures, savings will continue to accrue in the seven manufacturing consolidations that have been planned and that will start to kick-in in the second half. But, I think it is safe to say that the savings we are projecting in the second quarter would be in the $6 million to $8 million a quarter range. And as Keith mentioned in the script, we see it on a $12 million or so third quarter velocity as we exit the year at approximately $50 million in annualized savings. And so, obviously that's a lot data, as you can imagine for us to get our arms around, but we feel pretty comfortable that we can meet these numbers and we'll try and do better. And just to emphasize one of the points that Keith mentioned, is that right now you heard in my script that the foundry services, the manufacturing services business will go down this quarter as we expect, that's the second quarter. The LSI contract is falling off as we projected, but our own business will start to ramp particularly in the second half as more and more of our products are made in Gresham. And parallel to that, we will be closing some of our facilities, in particular, a smaller factory here will close down in the middle of the year and savings for that will start to kick in the second half. So, we have a lot of cost reduction expense saving programs that are active and will start to bear the fruit.
Craig Berger: And then just a couple housekeeping questions. The $66 million inventory write-up flows through in the second quarter and how does that progress thereafter? And then also how much was the foundry revenue in the first quarter?
Donald Colvin: The manufacturing services in the first quarter, we lumped together. Foundry and manufacturing services was about $22 million. So, I think we know start somewhere in a (inaudible) at least. And as far as the inventory write-up goes that's probably – most of it is going to flow through probably in the first one to two quarters, but you can see that some slow moving parts will be with us for awhile. So, I would not expect to get rid of the remains for at least a year. It just is quite a long half life of that stuff. But, a lot of it should go in the first one to two quarters, but we will still have this write-up with us for awhile.
Craig Berger: Thanks a lot.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Lehman Brothers.
Romit Shah: Hi, yes. Thanks for taking my question. Do you guys still expect to realize $40 million in manufacturing cost savings that's separate from AMI?
Keith Jackson: Yes. Our cost reductions there again those plans remain unchanged. They include, as Donald mentioned earlier, the closure of one of our wafer fabs, significant movement from outside boundaries into Gresham, and our normal cost reduction in dye shrink activities globally.
Romit Shah: So, just to clarify, we've got about $20 million or so in cost savings from AMI that has not been realized plus an additional $40 million from manufacturing cost savings that will layer in over the next six quarters?
Donald Colvin: Yes, but let's not say that. The time period of the additional AMI, let's say of 15 to 20, is probably more in the 18 month time period rather than in the 18 weeks. And then in addition to that, we will have our own savings on, I believe the number is in the region of about $10 million a quarter or $40 million a year.
Romit Shah: Right.
Donald Colvin: And AMI additional savings would be over the couple two-year period, 15 to 20. Now, the problem is that we cannot really say this is AMI or this is ON because we have consolidated our manufacturing operations – are under one management structure now and both teams are working incredibly effectively together under one organization. So, it will be meaningless to talk of AMI or ON separately, but these are the kind of ballpark numbers that we identified when we were on the road in December, and we don't feel in any way uncomfortable with realizing these numbers.
Romit Shah: Okay. And then Keith, it sounds like you are seeing a healthy pick up in your core business. When did orders bottom? Are customers trying to build inventory? Just a bit more color on what is happening.
Keith Jackson: Yes. Actually, the inventories as we've alluded to are actually extraordinarily lean. The channel at 10.5 is about as lean as we have ever been, and on an OEM basis, we're not detecting any build at this point. So, what's really happened is, we kept the inventories in a very good range throughout this cycle, customers are now ordering to what we believe to be run rates and, of course, those order rates picked up very nicely in March. We had a very strong March and we had a very strong April for new orders. So, we really think it's demand driven, there's no inventory to burn off, and so you are seeing pretty much manufacturing run rates of our customers.
Romit Shah: And is it tied to one particular end market?
Keith Jackson: It's not one end market. We are seeing some recovery now in the wireless handsets. We think that that is behind us, and we are seeing good strength in several of the large players there plus the indigenous Chinese starting to order again, that's definitely changed. The computing side building nicely as we would expect for the second quarter, and in general automotive also picking up for us despite some of the turmoil here in North America.
Romit Shah: Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of JP Morgan.
Chris Danely: Congratulations on making this start to work. Hey, Keith, just to follow along with Romit's question, can you just talk about what you expect from the end markets generally this year in terms of which do you think is better, where are you more concerned, and then how does your end market exposure change with the AMI acquisition?
Keith Jackson: So, end market exposure will increase our automotive percentage as we go through time. Very, very strong auto business at AMI. I do think that will be a strong market for ON Semiconductor this year and that's all about new design wins and not about end automotive sales. So, despite the fact I think the automobile sales this year will be flat to down around the world, we do expect to see a very nice gain for ON in our electronic sales there. Computing will also be very, very strong for us as we go through the year. We're expecting significant share gains in the second half with the new platform ramps and our customers. And so, that will be the other market that will look very, very strong from the Company perspective again, yes. And then the balance of the markets I would expect to be seasonal. The consumer-driven markets and consumer-related markets will pick up in the second half, but overall not show the robustness that we talked about in automotive and in computing.
Chris Danely: Got it. And then my follow up for Donald. So, Donald, when the dust has settled, where do you see ON's normalized gross margins and operating margins, and how long do you think it'll take to get there?
Donald Colvin: Well, I think we've already shown we believe the dust is moving in the right direction, Chris. We've had some pretty significant headwinds because of the currencies and inflation and that has held us back a little bit, and we announced that on the last call and I know just a lot of other companies addressed the same issues. But, right now the dollar looks like it's stabilizing and hopefully prices are also stabilizing, and we can have a stable environment. So, that the things we can impact through operating efficiencies can drive our margins stronger. But, we are looking between 40% to 41.5% gross margin in the second quarter, that's our guidance, and when you strip out the 1 off in the accounting charges, and as we move forward through the year as business holds up, we should be able to add to that as we ramp up Gresham and we ramp up revenue, as Keith mentioned, adds to our design wins and the strength of the end market. I cannot make a macro call. We only give guidance from one quarter out, but if business holds up as we see from our backlog and then we can certainly add a few points to gross margin as we go through the second half. And as you know, normally the second half shows stronger revenue and stronger gross margin for our business, which is seasonably better in the second half. As far as our longer-term models are concerned, we will present them to you next week. Previously, we stated that we believe we should 45% gross margin Company with an operating income in the 21% to 22% range. I don't see any reason why we should not continue to believe that. Obviously our revenue outlook will be stronger than we had previously indicated because of the acquisitions of both AMI and ADI. So, to answer your question specifically, we believe this business is totally capable of operating 45% gross margin and an operating margin above 20%.
Chris Danely: Perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramesh Misra of Collins Stewart.
Ramesh Misra: Good mornings, guys. Good numbers. My first question is related to the equipment overlap at the AMI side versus your Gresham and Czech fabs. Is there a similar tool set or is it drastically different?
Keith Jackson: The AMI, I've to split them into a couple of fabs here. Their 5-inch fab in Belgium looks pretty similar to our other 6-inch mostly bipolar factories. And that will be a very good cornerstone for us as we continue to consolidate that 6-inch platform around the world. The 5-inch does not match anything we have and we have announced we will be closing down that 5-inch factory in Idaho, and then the 8-inch equipment is a generation older than our Gresham factory, so we will consolidate our newest products into Gresham and have that 8-inch factory be our trailing-edge 8-inch factory.
Ramesh Misra: Okay, great. In regards to your typical trends second half over one half, Keith, you've historically seen and said that you expect 10% to 20% growth. Now with the design wins that you've been seeing lately and, of course, taking into consideration softness, at least in the U.S. markets, do you see yourself potentially being meaningfully away from that guideline?
Keith Jackson: This will, of course, be clouded by the acquisitions we've done. So, if I just try and imagine life the way it would have been if we were combined last year and imagine life the way it might be second half next year, I still expect to see unit growth in excess of 10%. Yes, we've got some great design win momentum. We've also got some big unknowns I think in the macro economy. So, I think it's really too soon for me to call substantially more than that at this point, but I'm actually pretty positive that we should see at least normal growth this year despite the macroeconomics.
Ramesh Misra: Okay. Thanks for that. Can I just get two housekeeping questions for Donald, please? Okay. How much of the contribution from ADI in Q1 and how much cash did you inherit from AMI?
Donald Colvin: Well, the contribution we gave on the release on a stand alone non-GAAP basis we were $0.20 and with AMI we were $0.21. So, it was right at $0.21. I think we got approximately –
Ramesh Misra: I am sorry. That is for ADI, right?
Donald Colvin: Oh, from AMI I was giving you. Okay.
Ramesh Misra: Yes.
Donald Colvin: So, from ADI, that's probably – I've got to sort everything out. It's probably roughly $0.01 something in that region.
Ramesh Misra: And what about in revenues from there?
Donald Colvin: And revenues we came in about 15
Ramesh Misra: Okay. And the cash from AMI?
Donald Colvin: About hundred.
Ramesh Misra: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Donald Colvin: On the cash, we also did some short-term borrowing and we give you all the details on that, I think we have at least over a hundred pages of information. So, we also published (inaudible) for your edification. And so, basically you should look at borrowing and cash as a combined company because we had to pay off about $280 million of AMI debt.
Ramesh Misra: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James.
Steve Smigie: Great, thank you. I was hoping you could help me understand your comments about position on Vcore a little bit better. It sounds like you are saying you believe you would be in a leadership position there. Are you counting that as say on a units basis based on controllers or are you saying if I take revenue of controllers, drivers, sets, add them up, you'll be in the lead that way? Is that –?
Keith Jackson: We think we'll be in the lead position in desktop Vcore controllers in the second half. So, we are waiting on our design wins for the latest generation motherboards to start ramping in that May/June timeframe, and we think we'll actually just on Vcore, Steve, be the leader there.
Steve Smigie: Okay. And could you similarly give some thoughts on where you'll be on the notebook side?
Keith Jackson: Notebook side, we've had virtually no penetration on our Vcore controllers and system controllers last year. It was mostly a (inaudible) business for us last year, and this year, we are projecting some significant ramps in the second half, probably not the number one supplier yet, but certainly significant displacement that will occur in the marketplace for share gains.
Steve Smigie: Okay, great. Congratulations on the nice numbers.
Keith Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes, good morning, guys, and let me add my congratulations. A couple of quick questions. First, any time there's an acquisition there's a level of uncertainty created with the customer base. I am curious how you are managing the AMI customer base and are you worried at all that they are building inventory just as a buffer as just in case? Then I have a follow up.
Keith Jackson: Yes. We've been out and we've talked to those customers. In general, the reaction has been that they like the acquisition. They like basically ON Semiconductor's supply chain management, and feel very comfortable with that. And as such, we have not seen any build in inventory there or any dramatic change, frankly, in backlog or order rates beyond what we expect for the end market use. So, we do not believe we are seeing any kind of inventory build up on the AMI side.
John Pitzer: And, Keith, as you consolidate manufacturing, do you think that will hold or do you think customers might want to take a little bit more inventory as you guys consolidate manufacturing?
Keith Jackson: In general, they don't like taking extra inventory. There may be a little bit toward the end of next year when we start getting to the closure phase of those factories. But, upfront I don't expect any changes whatsoever. So, I think we are a year away from any kind of security builds because we've again put timelines on these things of about 18 months.
John Pitzer: And then last question, Donald, you talked about the foundry services business being down $8 million in June. How does that tail off after that and can you help me understand the gross margin differential between that business and the core business?
Donald Colvin: Sure. We always new we had to take or pick [ph] on side with LSI that was going to terminate this year, and they sold us a factory because they were moving to more advanced technology. So, we've always anticipated this. The revenue will probably fall in the second half to $10 million to $12 million per quarter, in that range. The margin on this basically we don't make any profit, it's sold at cost. But the disadvantage of that is it's a very high cash contributor. And so, it's a margin challenge as that revenue comes down. I think the good news is that it's bottoming out and 80% or so of the decline is already baked into the guidance numbers we've given for the second quarter. When I mean 80%, I mean the numbers have come down about 80% from their peak. So, I think that we are now taking up the burden of filling that factory ourselves. The second half of last year, our stocks were more than LSI stocks. As Keith mentioned, we have installed new processes and we are now starting to ramp a lot of our own products in there. And we'll also be building stuff we installed last year for our second half computing ramp. In addition to that, we've identified products from AMI acquisition that'll also start to ramp next year. So, we are feeling that we turned the corner there. Acquiring a huge facility like that has never been an easy challenge, but it puts us in an excellent position to be successful in the markets where we operate. And let me just say one point, that's one thing that's going down well with the AMI customers having that facility helps a lot as far as our credibility is concerned. And we have integrated the manufacturing and technology organizations because AMI's technology roadmap was the same as ours. They may need the same kind of technologies that we were installing in Gresham, and as we mentioned in the script that they have many engineers that will compliment our effort there. So, surely we are underpinning our efforts toward Gresham and help accelerate the ramp of Gresham.
John Pitzer: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang of Wedbush.
Steve Park: Hi, this is Steve on behalf of Patrick here. Just had a quick question on, is there any end market ASP weakness? Have you guys seen that anything in the quarter there?
Keith Jackson: There is no significant differentiate on those end markets from an ASP pressure. They're all looking very similar and relatively benign for our first quarter. Normally our first quarter is the worst quarter of the year. That's when everybody redoes their annual work in addition to the normally quarterly work. So, frankly, it's all looking about the same.
Steve Park: Okay, great. Just one last quick question is, can you update us on the stock buy back program – is there – what's remaining?
Donald Colvin: I think right now for the first half of the year of the acquisition, we had to pay down the buying debt we said $280 million or so from AMI. And we now have a certain cash restructuring cost that we are paying in the second quarter. So, I do not think it's fair to talk about immediate action on stock buy back, but we remain attentive and as things settle down, integration progresses well, we will certainly be looking at that in a more benign manner in the second half of the year. Our cash balance will start to build again, and we know we will be able to harvest some other opportunities. I'll remind you that we have been aggressive in stock buy backs in the past having bought back approximately 45 million shares, and we continue to look at ways to enhance shareholder value. In the current volatile environment of the first quarter, I think you probably all noticed a lot of companies were more concentrating on keeping cash rather than rushing to buy back stock. And especially with us doing that acquisition, we did not go out to the market and raise any expensive debt to complete the acquisition. We have been concentrating more on integration and paying off of the AMI debt rather than stock buy back. But that's something that will be top of our priorities for the second half.
Steve Park: Can I ask one more quick question just on the commodity prices, do you expect that to continue in the gross margin and how are you guys seeing that for next quarter?
Keith Jackson: Yes. I mean, next quarter is again looking at numbers that are not significant. I think we said the 1% plus range for those commodities, and what I actually expect there is our lead times are starting to expand. I think the second half will see the industry largely sold out in those commodities. So, I'm not expecting accelerating price pressure there this year.
Steve Park: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is a follow up from Craig Ellis of Citi.
Craig Ellis: Thanks for taking the follow up. Keith, you mentioned that there are some out source production you can bring into Gresham. Can you just provide some more color on how significant that would be?
Keith Jackson: Yes, fairly significantly. So, to put it in terms here in the second quarter, we are looking at bringing in about 400 wafers a week of manufacturing by the end of the quarter from outside to inside. And then that number increases in Q3 and Q4 to somewhere in the 600 or so wafers a week. And so, it's a pretty substantial pull in.
Craig Ellis: Okay. That is helpful, and then, can you provide us some qualitative color on how significant you think the manufacturing cost differential is between say your Gresham facility and the facilities that you acquired as part of the AMI deal. I know it'll take some time to port product over as it's developed, but how should we think about the cost differential that you can arbitrage there?
Keith Jackson: Yes. So, on an 8 inch to 8-inch basis, the wafer costs are nearly half in Gresham what they were in the acquired assets.
Craig Ellis: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your final question is a follow up from Craig Berger of FBR Capital Market.
Craig Berger: Yes, thanks for taking the follow up. Can you just tell us why you did better-than-expected in the first quarter apart from AMIS?
Donald Colvin: I think there were several things. Our core business performed well. We had actually a bit of a disappointing – how should I say it – end to the year – it finished the year with a dump buying rather than a load buying, particularly related to wireless market in China. And that business recovered in February and continued strong, so we had a very good year-end in sales, particularly through distribution and our distribution inventories came way, way down. So, we ended with a bang on the revenue front and our core business actually came in at the higher end of guidance. We also tightened the belt on expanses both in OpEx and manufacturing, and our team responded. And our operating expenses on a stand alone basis came in well. We took tightened expense controls and they were effective.
Craig Berger: Thank you for that. On the cash and the debt, it looks like you are going to be generating $300 million or $400 million a year of pro forma cash flow. How else would you like to pay down your debt or how quickly do you think it's possible?
Donald Colvin: I think as I mentioned, the priorities change with the macro environment, but the game plan still remains the same. We'll generate more than enough cash to pay down our debt. As I mentioned in my comments on our tax rate, which remains very low, we will have more than enough cash generated even in the U.S. to pay down our debt with the tax rate guidance that we give you. And then we continue to look opportunistically at actions to buy back stock, and once we get over the hurdle, which will be by the middle of the year, of pay to cash restructure costs to pay off the AMI debt, we will be able to look at stock buy backs as I mentioned on the previous question. Our cash balance will start to grow in the second half again, and we'll do whatever is best in the most shareholder friendly manner. We don't have any big debt amortization requirements over the next few years, and the weighted average cost on our debt is in the 2% to 3%. So, we don't have any junk bond type interest rates that we can pay off are very accretive. So, we are always looking at that trade off between a minimal interest saving and stock buyback. And one of the ironies is, we raised a few years ago a big convert [ph] which is a zero coupon [ph], and that's the first major chunk of debt that where the amortization is due. But, as you can understand, you don't have any interest savings when you pay down a zero coupon bond. So, it's probably a quality problem, so that's why we have better locked into look at paying down debt.
Craig Berger: Donny?
Donald Colvin: Yes.
Craig Berger: You've done a really good job on that front. Last one, on the taxes, you said you had $800 million of U.S. NOLs. How much of your income is routed through the U.S.? When do those NOLs expire? And so, when would you actually see moving to the long-term tax rate?
Donald Colvin: Well, most of our business is offshore, over 80%. Even now it's approximately 80% with the AMI just a little bit under that. And so, our U.S. NOLs we think are going to last for 10 years or whatever more. And so, most of our income is offshore, but we have means to bring that income back to the States, and that is incorporated in the longer-term tax rate that I gave, which is 10% to 12%, is incorporating bringing back cash and paying U.S. taxes on that so that we have the cash in the right place when we need it.
