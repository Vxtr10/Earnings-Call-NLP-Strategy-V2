Emeka Chukwu: Thank you, Sandy. Good afternoon, everyone. For Q4 fiscal year 2020, net sales decreased 2% sequentially to $178 million, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. Fiscal year 2020 net sales decreased 13% over the prior year driven by the challenging microenvironment the overall industry faced for much of the year, fueled by the China tariff and Huawei ban.In Q4, shipments into Asia represented 78% of net sales. North America represented 13% and Europe represented 9%. Total direct sales represented approximately 24% and sales to distribution were approximately 76%. Our distribution business remains balanced with 55% of the total POS coming from the high-end consumer and enterprise computing end markets. And 45% of total POS coming from the industrial and communications end market. While bookings declined slightly over the prior quarter, book-to-bill was above one.Sales booking accounted for approximately 37% of shipments during the quarter. Q4 GAAP gross margin came in as expected at 61.1%. And we expect that Q1 gross margin to be relatively flat sequentially. Q4 GAAP operating expense increased 8% sequentially due to higher pension expense, share based compensation expense and new product expense. In Q1, we expect GAAP operating expense to decrease between 8% to 12% sequentially primarily due to lower amortization of intangibles, lower share based compensation expense, lower pension expense and lower new product expenses.Q4 GAAP interest and other expenses increased to $3.1 million from $1.5 million in Q3, driven by the payment of some of our minority investments and write-off of previously capitalized debt issuance cost from our refinanced debt. Q4 GAAP tax rate was approximately 59%, up from 16% in Q3, primarily due to the impact of an internal asset transfer between tax jurisdictions. Note that there was no significant cash tax impact from this action.We expect our GAAP tax rate for Q1 of fiscal year 2021 to be in the range of 23% to 27%. Our GAAP tax rate forecast excludes consideration of any impact on discrete items including excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the exercise of stock options.Moving on to the non-GAAP results which excluded impact of share based compensation, amortization of acquiring tangibles, acquisition related and other non-recurrent charges. As expected Q4 non-GAAP gross margin declined slightly over the prior quarter to 61.5% and we expect our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be generally flat with Q4 levels. In fiscal year 2021, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to strengthen through the year as demand from our higher margin growth engines recover and overall demand improves. Q4 non-GAAP operating expense increased 2% sequentially to $53.9 million due to higher new product expenses.In Q1, we expect non-GAAP operating expense to be flat to down 4% sequentially mostly due to determine of new product expenses. For fiscal year 2021, we expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to increase at roughly half the rate of revenue growth which is consistent with our target operating model. In Q4, our non-GAAP tax rates decreased to approximately 9% reflecting a favorable mix of regional income. We expect our Q1 and fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP tax rates to remain in the 14% to 16% range. In Q4, cash flow from operations increase to 33% of net sales, up from 24% in Q3.We repurchased approximately 546,000 or $27.6 million worth of stock in Q4 and approximately 1.5 million shares or $70.2 million of stock in fiscal year 2020. And our stock repurchase authorization now stands for approximately $110 million. We expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments and pay down debt.In Q4, our cash and investments balance was $293 million and our debt balance was approximately $197 million resulted in a net cash position of $96 million. In Q4, accounts receivable represented 41 days of sales which is at the lower end of our target range of 40 to 45 days. Net inventory was sequentially flat at 121 days and remains a global target range of 90 to 100 days. In Q1, we expect net inventory to increase slightly because of the macro-driven uncertainties and demand.In summary, we were pleased to deliver strong Q4 results despite all the macro uncertainties. Looking ahead, we believe that our secular growth drivers of hyperscale data center, 5G infrastructure and Internet of Things. Our stable gross margin, our well controlled operating expenses, our strong cash flow generation and our efficient capital allocation provides us the platform for a strong financial performance in fiscal year 2021.I will now hand the call over to Mohan.
Mohan Maheswaran: Thank you, Emeka. Good afternoon. everyone. I will discuss our Q4 fiscal year 2020 performance by end market and by product group. Discuss our fiscal year 2020 performance and then provide our outlook for Q1 of fiscal year 2021. In Q4 of fiscal year 2020, net revenues decreased 2% over the prior quarter to $138 million. Softer demand from the industrial and consumer end markets was offset by stronger demand for enterprise computing and communications end markets, which contributed to better than seasonal results for Q4.We posted non-GAAP gross margin of 61.5% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.40. In Q4 fiscal year 2020 net revenues from the enterprise computing end market increased sequentially and represented 32% of total net revenues. Net revenues from the communications end market increased sequentially and represented 10% of total net revenues. Net revenues from the industrial end market decreased sequentially and also represented 31% of total net revenues. Net revenues from the high-end consumer market decreased slightly over the prior quarter and represented 26% of total revenues, approximately 18% of high-end consumer net revenues were attributable to mobile devices and approximately 8% was attributable to other consumer systems.I will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. In Q4 of fiscal year 2020, net revenues from our signal integrity product group increased 1% sequentially and represented 43% of total revenues. Stronger demand from the data center and base station segments contributed to the sequential growth. In Q4, demand from the data center market increased nicely over the prior quarter led by record revenues from our CDR platforms. Strong demand for our ClearEdge CDRs used in 100 gig NRZ modules was driven by our hyper scale and cloud customers.We expect this strength to continue throughout fiscal year 2021. Interest in our new Tri-Edge PAM-4 CDRs remains very high. This week we received our first production order for our Tri-Edge products and we already have numerous customers going through system tests with our latest Tri-Edge PAM-4 silicon. The advantages of analog PAM-4 for implementations are very clear as the lower power, lower cost and lower latency provides our datacenter customers with a compelling advantage over existing solutions.We expect to see our Tri-Edge revenues ramp throughout the year at hyper scale data center customers deploying 100 gig, 200 gig and 400 gig optical modules that require lower latency and lower power. The Open Eye MSA consortium that was formed to support and promote interoperability of analog CDR platforms has seen its membership more than double to 40-plus companies since its founding and includes key chip companies as well as software and systems vendors of next-generation pam-4 optical systems. Our FiberEdge PMD devices also continue winning designs in pam-4 modules where we have collaborated with DSP providers to deliver optical module vendors, a highly optimized solution.We recently announced the production of our newest quad linear 100 gig per channel TIA platform for 400 gig optical modules targeted at hyper scale data centers. Our FiberEdge products complement our ClearEdge and Tri-Edge CDR platforms, which we expect to continue to ramp this year. Following a relatively weak fiscal year 2020 performance, we expect to see much stronger growth from the hyper scale data center market in fiscal year 2021. In Q4 of fiscal year 2020, our PON business declined sequentially. Semtech remains a leading supplier to the PON market providing comprehensive offerings for 1 gig, 2.5 gig and 10 gig PON OLT and ONU systems.Recent macro events in China have limited our near-term visibility, but we expect the ongoing rollout of 10-PON deployments to accelerate in conjunction with 5G infrastructure build outs and to drive growth in our PON business in fiscal year 2021. We anticipate a 100% increase in 10 gig PON deployments in fiscal year 2021 driven by China, Europe and the US. In Q4 of fiscal year 2020, demand from our wireless base station market increased sequentially as 5G infrastructure deployments start to accelerate. Our ClearEdge CDR platforms are gaining solid momentum in the 5G market and we have begun early shipments of our ClearEdge CDRs into 5G base station front hall and mid hall optical modules.We expect both our ClearEdge and Tri-Edge platforms to gain momentum in 5G base stations as 5G infrastructure deployments increase globally. In fiscal year 2021, we expect our base station revenues to increase as we expect to see continued 4G spending and a meaningful increase in spending for 5G where our market opportunity could triple versus 4G. The ever-increasing demand for higher data rates by data centers, passive optical networks and wireless broadband networks is driving greater demand for Semtech signal integrity product platforms, which is a secular trend we expect to continue for some time and we remain very confident in our strategy and position in our target markets.In Q1 of fiscal year 2021, we expect net revenues from our signal integrity product group to decline driven by softer demand across all segments driven primarily by the impact of the coronavirus. We do anticipate that this temporary demand softness will turn into stronger demand in the second half of fiscal year 2021.Moving on to our protection products group. In Q4 of fiscal year 2020, net revenues from our protection products group declined 6% sequentially and represented 27% of total revenues. In Q of fiscal year 2020, our high-end consumer protection business experienced the typical seasonal inventory reductions. While near term smartphone demand has been impacted by macro events. The prospects for our protection platforms in mobile devices, displays and accessories remains positive as 5G smartphones integrate higher performance interfaces and more advanced photography devices. Our protection business continues to benefit from its successful diversification into key industrial markets, including automotive, IoT and broad-based industrial applications.In Q4, our protection product group announced the latest member of its RClamp platform, a multi-line protection array that delivers outstanding protection for a broad range of high-speed interfaces and ports in industrial, IoT and telecommunications applications. In Q1 of fiscal year 2021, we are expecting our protection revenues to be approximately flat.Turning to our wireless and sensing product group. In Q4 of fiscal year 2020, net revenues from our wireless and sensing product were decrease 2% sequentially and represented 30% of total revenues. Q4 was another quarter of strong achievements by our LoRa business. We recently announced several new use cases and partnerships that demonstrate the benefits and efficiencies of LoRa. A few of these announcements in Q4 included Wilhelmsen, the largest marine networking operator on the planet announced the use of 2.4 gigahertz LoRa to deliver IoT solutions to the maritime shipping industry on both land and at sea.LoRa will be deployed in ships for predictive maintenance, temperature monitoring, asset management and asset tracking. Smart Seoul Network or S-Net announced LoRaWan network to provide smart parking, smart street lighting solutions and geolocation use cases in Seoul, Korea. Helium announced a new nationwide LoRaWAN network in the US. Their current network supports over 745 cities in the US NSOFT, an Indian solutions provider is using LoRa to convert order metering solutions to new advanced metering infrastructure, reducing waste and costs while increasing efficiency. And L-Measure, a utility metering developer and [Clogie] a maker of long-range sensor networks develops a new line of prepaid smart meters based on LoRa technology that tracks and reports usage data in real time for precise billing and reduced energy wastage.These are just a few examples of the many new use cases introduced during the quarter that demonstrate the value of LoRa technology in enabling a smarter and more sustainable planet. In Q4 of fiscal year 2020, demand for our proximity sensing platforms increased as global RF regulations and awareness of the dangers of RF signals continues to increase. We expect that proximity sensing business to grow in fiscal year 2021 as we see solid design win progress in new 5G smartphones, where there is an increase in the number of high performance radios used.For Q1 of fiscal year 2021, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to decrease due to the impact of the coronavirus.Moving on to new products and design wins. In Q4 of fiscal year 2020, we release 26 new products and achieve 2, 184 new design wins.Now let me comment briefly on our fiscal year 2020 performance. In fiscal year 2020, net revenues declined 13% over the prior year's record performance. Driven primarily by geopolitical headwinds which negatively impacted all of our product groups. In fiscal year 2020, we had 74 new product releases and achieved another design win record of 9,909 new design wins. In FY20, our signal and integrity product group introduced several new disruptive platforms that should contribute to our long-term growth. These include our Tri-Edge PAM-4 CDRs and FiberEdge PMD platforms for the data center and 5g wireless markets. Our 10 gig PON platforms and new software defined video Over Ethernet platform targeted at a pro AV market.In FY20, our protection product group continued its diversification into new broad-based industrial verticals including the automotive and IoT markets, where the increasing use of advanced photography devices are making systems more susceptible to damage from transient events such as voltage spikes. In addition, our protection business from US-based smartphone manufacturers achieved a new annual revenue record further diversifying our mobile revenues geographically. In FY20, our wireless and sensing product group made significant progress in advancing Semtech's LoRa technology to be the global de facto standard for the LPWAN market.Our LoRa enabled revenue declined approximately 5% to $74 million from $78 million in fiscal year 2019 due to lower revenues from China. However, our LoRa enabled POS group grew by 7% from fiscal year 2019 and represented a new POS record. In FY20, our LoRa business met or exceeded all the metrics we targeted at the beginning of the year. These metrics included, one, the number of countries with LoRa networks grew to more than 91 countries from 70 at the end of fiscal year 2019. By the end of fiscal year 2021, we expect over a 100 countries to have LoRa networks. Two, the number of public or private LoRa network operators grew to 133 at the end of fiscal year 2020 from 101 in FY19.We expect 150 LoRa network operators by the end of fiscal year 2021. The number of LoRa gateways deployed grew 164% from 243,000 gateways in fiscal year 2019 to 642,000 gateways at the end of fiscal year 2020. These gateways are capable of supporting approximately 2.5 billion connected end loads. We expect the number of LoRa gateways deployed to increase to over 1 million by the end of fiscal year 2021. The cumulative number of LoRa end nodes increased 55% to 135 million at the end of fiscal year 2020 from 87 million at the end of fiscal year 2019.We expect this number to continue to grow rapidly and exceed 180 million cumulative end nodes by the end of fiscal year 2021. Five, the LoRa opportunity pipeline exceeded $500 million at the end of fiscal year 2020 with an additional $200 million of leads feeding the opportunity pipeline. We anticipate that on average 40% to 50% of this pipeline will convert to full deployment over a 24 month timeline. Our pipeline remains geographically well balanced with approximately 65% of the opportunities coming from the Americas and Europe and includes a growing number of use cases in the smart home and consumer markets, where the volumes could be significantly higher and could drive deployments more rapidly than from industrial markets.At the end of fiscal year 2021, we are anticipating our opportunity pipeline will exceed $700 million with an additional $300 million of leads feeding these opportunities. We expect the strong momentum in our LoRa metrics to continue in fiscal year 2021 as the LPWAN market starts to grow rapidly and as our new LoRa technology platforms are adopted. These new LoRa platforms include our LoRa smart home platform designed for LPWAN based smart home community and consumer applications, providing low-power, broad coverage for indoor neighborhood and campus area IoT devices, used for safety, environmental and convenience use cases.Our LoRa global platform that uses a 2.4 gigahertz version of LoRa to enable global use cases requiring higher bandwidth. And our LoRa edge platform which is a highly versatile and extremely low-power Software Defined LoRa platform that enables a broad range of asset management applications targeted at industrial, building, home, transportation and logistics segments. Our LoRa platform includes Wi-Fi sniffing and GPS location features enabling the most versatile LPWAN geolocation platform in the industry. This platform will also drive our future cloud services business with the first service being a geolocation service for asset tracking applications.Armed with these new platforms, along with the increasing influence and momentum of the LoRa alliance, we expect to continue to drive LoRa to become the de facto standard for the global LPWAN market in what we expect to be a multi-billion unit industry in the next five years. For FY21, we are expecting our LoRa enabled revenues to be between $90 million and $120 million. Despite the ongoing headwinds in China and the uncertainties associated with the coronavirus with a positive momentum from our LoRa metrics and growth in our opportunity funnel, we continue to anticipate a 40% CAGR for our LoRa enabled business over the next five years.Now let me discuss our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. While the near-term visibility remains challenging and despite the ongoing headwinds associated with China demand, the Huawei ban and the uncertainty associated with the coronavirus, we believe the underlying demand for our products remains very strong. Based on our backlog entering the quarter, we are currently estimating Q1 net revenues to be between $125 million and $135 million. This guidance assumes a $10 million negative impact due to the coronavirus and assumes no more direct shipments to Huawei this quarter. To attain the midpoint of that guidance range or approximately $130 million, we needed net turns orders of approximately 27% at the beginning of Q1.We expect that Q1 non-GAAP earnings to be between $0.30 and $0.36 per diluted share. I will now hand the call back to the operator. And Sandy and Emeka and I will be happy to answer any questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]Your first question comes from line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.
ChristopherRolland: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Yes, just any more details on LoRa. What percentage of LoRa today is China and where did it peak out? I'm just trying to get a sense of how this is diversifying outside of China and what gives you confidence in your outlook looking forward? Thanks.
MohanMaheswaran: For LoRa used to be said about 60% of the revenue was from China. I think it's still close to that. It's being - it's definitely diversifying now and the opportunity pipeline has as I mentioned about 60%, 65% of the opportunity pipeline is outside China. So that diversification across the different regions is happening. I would say that though that China from being a headwind for us last year continues to actually be quite strong as we look at it now. Bookings are stronger and I think China in general may be the first region to kind of overcome all the coronavirus main issues. And as we see capacity coming back online that seems to be strengthening the demand in China.So it's difficult to call how the next year will play out but I think going forward definitely with the opportunities being more geographically balanced, I think we'll expect to get little bit more of a balanced revenue geographically over the next few years here.
ChristopherRolland: Great. And then your guidance, it kind of looks like it's in line with others in terms of the effects from the virus. You also called out that this was probably mostly supply chain and less about demand disruption. Maybe you can talk about the supply chain. What you're seeing there? Is it upstream? Is it downstream? And also what gives you confidence that that demands comes back and that there's no actual demand destruction in the end? Thanks.
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. I would say, first of all, I don't think yet we have really seen any major supply chain issues. I think what's clear is that China as a region we are struggling with the coronavirus and with the move out shift of Chinese New Year that impacted the overall demand for sure. And it's slowly coming back online and maybe not somewhere around between 70% and 80% capacity, I think. So demand fully isn't there yet but all indications prior to the coronavirus were that demand for Q1 was going to be strong. It's still remaining relatively strong I would say. Bookings have been pretty healthy. Our turns required is fairly low compared to what we've done historically.So that all gives us a very good feeling and then also when we see the different segments, we play in. Now we see data center strength and we see 5G infrastructure strength and we see generally infrastructural areas doing quite well plus one would anticipate some type of stimulus both in Asia and maybe in other countries that will again impact infrastructure. So we're anticipating once the demands environment settles around after the coronavirus kind of stabilizes, we're expecting the demand to pick up again.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
QuinnBolton: Hey, guys. I guess just wanted to follow up on that. It sounds like you haven't seen any major supply chain constraints. Bookings are starting to recover especially in China as coronavirus there seems to be getting a little bit more under control. So I guess when we look at your April quarter guidance and a $10 million that you adjusted for coronavirus. Where did that come from? Is that just sort of lost demand as factories were offline or just near-term demand destruction within the China market in the month of February? Or are you anticipating potential cancellations or push outs or something in the March and April order book that you may not have seen yet but you're just being conservative and you know let you allowing for some potential push outs or cancellations over the next couple of months? And then I get a couple of follow-ups.
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. Quinn, it's a little bit of everything you said actually. It's some data points to suggest that some of the PON tenders and you know proof-of-concept and LoRa being slightly pushed out. So we see a little bit of push outs of those. We haven't seen any cancellations or revenue demand push out or revenue push out. We've seen more indications that things are just kind of being delayed. Clearly, there's some softness as I said because the Chinese New Year was delayed and some delay and just bringing up capacity in China. So that impacted it and clearly there is some nervousness and uncertainty around the coronavirus around the world. And so I think all of those kind of give us food for thought as we were planning our Q1 number and we anticipate a kind of approximately a $10 million impact, which is reflected in our numbers.
QuinnBolton: Great. And they just wanted to switch over to the data center market. It sounds like you're expecting a stronger year in fiscal 2021, just wanted to confirm that I heard that correctly and follow up on the Tri-Edge sounds like you get your first production order, So congratulations on that just wondering as you look through fiscal 2021 for Tri-Edge, does that ramp to any kind of meaningful level? I mean could it be a few million bucks a quarter by the end of the year? Could it be larger or is it a kind of a slower ramp? Any sort of magnitude of how quickly you think that business takes off could be, would be helpful. Thank you.
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. When the actually the NRZ CDRS as I mentioned, we're still - that's doing extremely well which suggests to us that the probably the PAM-4 stuff will be a little bit slower, but I think one of the compelling value propositions of Tri-Edge is the lower power and lower cost. So a lot will depend on how fast the customers want to transition. I think, so but we had planned on a stronger kind of second half so maybe $3 million, $4 million in the second half year of the year and then really ramping up next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
KarlAckerman: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. I know you guys don't want to go out on a limb and talk about a preliminary guide for fiscal 2021, but I'm curious to the extent you could comment or willing to comment, it was too early to suggest that you can grow top line this year just given the strong growth opportunity across LoRa and your data center business. And despite your view that OpEx will grow half rate of sales I guess how flexible can OpEx be in the event growth turns out to be a little bit less than your current expectations. Then I have a follow-up.
MohanMaheswaran: So let me take the revenue on and then Emeka can talk about OpEx. I mean if we look at across our portfolio, data center I expect to still grow this year. It comes off a relatively like fiscal year 2020. We're expecting 10 gig PON to grow this year mostly driven by China but other regions as well. So our anticipation it may not be as fast because of the coronavirus in the first half. So but I'd expect second half for sure, 5G infrastructure, we know is being pushed out there once in every region of the world. And so we're expecting base station infrastructure to grow versus last year. Again the timing is the key question and then of course if we look at our IoT business and LoRa that's, we're still expecting that to grow. We have the pipeline and LoRa remember many of the use cases are really energy efficiency, productivity enhancements, cost reduction kind of approaches and even smart and health kind of segments. So LoRa should in many ways still be able to grow I think regardless of what transpires at least from an annual standpoint.And then in our protection business as you know, we are slightly diversifying that business, diversifying both in the mobile area geographically and industrial area. And so we are expecting that to also do reasonably well if the general macro does well and distributors replenish on their inventory at least again in the second half. And so pretty much across the board we are seeing all of our product groups, we're expecting growth. Of course, a lot depends on what transpires over the next quarter here with the coronavirus. The indications are that in China things are improving and certainly we're seeing that from a demand standpoint. How sustainable that is and what period of time, we'll just have to wait and see but the moment I think of a more positive than negative on it.
EmekaChukwu: And so, Karl, with regard to the operating expense, one of the things that we've actually been able to do very well in the history of the company is a manage our operating expenses in line with what the top line is going. One of the key things that I've always tried to call investors’ attention to that about 20% of operating expenses is variable and so we do have a few opportunities that we can modulate or depending on what's going on with the top line. Having said that though we are really very excited about some of the growth opportunities that we have within the company. The investments we are making in those areas and so we still believe on the expectation is that those growth drivers would start to come to fruition right here and that there wouldn't be any need to take any drastic actions with regards to operating expenses.
KarlAckerman: I appreciate that Mohan and Emeka thank you. For my follow-up if I may, double clicking on sort of protection for a moment. Are there new opportunities you see growing protection and proximity sensing beyond your key South Korean OEM? You had mentioned on our prior calls design wins around wearables. So just curious if any updated talks there. Thank you.
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. We actually - that's been a strategy of us for a while. We've obviously being strong in Korea for some time but a few years ago we made the conscious decision that we're going to really go aggressively try to diversify. I get smartphone business in China, smartphone business in North America proximity sensing business as well as protection business in these areas. And then look at smartphones and wearables and accessories. And I would say we've been successful and what with all of those strategies. I mean if I look at the business today, we have a fairly balanced geographical spread of protection in mobile devices in Korea, in China and Asia and also in North America, US specifically. And then also proximity sensing where it used to be just Korea is also starting to now spread its wings into Asia and into other US manufacturers and not only in smartphones but also in wearables as well.So that is a strategy; it continues to be a strategy and we are being quite successful with that strategy.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
ToreSvanberg: Yes. Thank you. Let me start with housekeeping. I think you mention 27% turns. Where's that number today kind of one with the more than a month into the quarter.
MohanMaheswaran: Tore, we can't give you that number but what I can tell you is that the bookings have been pretty strong. And we feel very good about where we are.
ToreSvanberg: Okay. So it's not like you've seen strong bookings at the beginning of the quarter and those are now tailing off. You apparently are seeing steady linear booking, okay.
MohanMaheswaran: Correct.
ToreSvanberg: Okay. Thank you. Second question on LoRa, so you gave us all the metrics for the fiscal year, thank you for that by the way. A lot of great information. It just seems like in all the categories there's growth, obviously, your revenues did not grow so can you just talk a little bit about that? I mean is this because of certain China customers going to MB IOT or helps us understand why your business were down while all the other metrics were optically there.
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. I think part of the thing you have to remember which is why I mentioned it, Tore, our POS did grow 7%. So and that's really the measure of deployments of end loads, right. So our revenues when we ship them, we make count the revenue when we ship in distribution, but if there's excess channel inventory something like that then we may not - you may not get the full picture. So that's one thing to remember. The second thing to remember is that the reason I give out all these metrics is to indicate momentum and momentum is really the indicator of future revenue. When you look at how many gateways to deploy use cases, how many end nodes are being deployed or how many countries is being deployed, the assumption is that customers are going to deploy once they've completed their proof of concepts and they go to full implementation. They're going to deploy more end nodes and more devices. And that will drive revenue. So the timing of the revenues is quite challenging for us especially when we had like we did last year one region of the world like China initially more really in the first half just really struggled and kind of it was difficult to catch it up in the second half of the year.We don't think that will happen this year. We think that's going to be a little bit more stable. And we're projecting reasonable growth this year and beyond.
ToreSvanberg: Maybe just one last question, your pipeline revenue increased $200 million year-over-year. I was just hoping you could talk a bit about the mix of that $200 million again from a geographic perspective. I do appreciate that there's a much higher percentage outside of China, but if you could add a little more color on North America versus US versus other countries that would be great.
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. Let's see, so I would say about 30% is Americas that includes in North America, South America about 36% is Europe and then the rest is 11%, about 11%-12% is rest of Asia, and Japan and Korea and then about 23% is - 25% is China something like that. Those are approximate figures sorry but that will give you an idea of the opportunity pipeline.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
GaryMobley: Hey, guys. I guess it's probably worth saying congratulations to a strong finish to the year and perhaps it's better than feared start to this current fiscal year 2021. My question relates to your turns business requirement embed in your first quarter guidance. My calculation is correct you're assuming roughly $10 million, $12 million in lower turns requirement for the embedment in the midpoint of the revenue guide. And I'm assuming much of that's related to Huawei and so my question is, did you generate a new turns business from Huawei in the just reported fourth quarter? And what sort of a best case scenario in terms of what you can actually shift to Huawei based on the current restrictions?
MohanMaheswaran: So remember, Gary, so our guidance assumes no more shipments to Huawei. So we don't need any more turns into Huawei to get to achieve our number. Sure having said that I think we plan on shipping every quarter about $10 million to Huawei I think that's what we did last quarter
GaryMobley: $9.5 million
MohanMaheswaran: About $10 million last quarter and it's a mix of all the different products and it obviously takes into consideration what we can and cannot ship. And if the restriction is in further squeezed then we have to re-look at it but that's the reason why as we give out our guidance, I've made the decision not to communicate that. We don't need any more turns from Huawei to make our number so because we just don't know exactly what's going to happen with the restriction as far as we're concerned, we're just assuming that the restriction will continue as it is.
GaryMobley: Yes. Okay. And did I see a roughly $2 million restructuring in the non-GAAP reconciliation and what does that relate to? Is that an actual headcount reduction or you refocusing your investment in perhaps a different area?
EmekaChukwu: No. I think they has mostly to do with an actuarial valuation of our defined benefit obligations and a few other things, but there was no restructuring in terms of letting people go and stuff like during the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Tristan Gerra with Baird & Company. Please proceed with your question.
TristanGerra: Hi. Good afternoon. From the $10 million impact in the current quarter guidance from China is that pretty much located across all the businesses you have in China or would you say a majority of that is actually related to LoRa? And in general how much of a step back you think the situation in China is impacting your revenue growth assumption for LoRa revenue this fiscal year?
MohanMaheswaran: So, Tristan, the $10 million is really a coronavirus impact and I think it actually majority of it is impacting our signal integrity product group at least 40%, 60%. And then maybe the rest of it is split between our protection and our wireless and sensing business. So it's a broad impact that we've estimated there and then the second part of your question is we believe that LoRa enabled business is going to do very well this year and China is going to come back and already we've seen indications of that. It may take the first quarter as I mentioned because of Chinese New Year and because companies are not coming back at full capacity in China and because some of the proofs of concepts are definitely going to be delayed because of that. And just travel and people not being able to move around in China as much is going to push out some of the activity. That's why I mentioned that proof of concepts and some of the new tenders and things like that may be shifted.But I don't think it changes the underlying demand or the need out there and so that's why we feel that any loss of demand in Q1 probably will pick up assuming things get back to normal we picked up in the second half.
TristanGerra: Okay. That's useful. And then as my follow-up question in your quarter guidance what changes in distribution inventories are you assuming if any? Are you assuming that inventory stay flat or on a relative basis at this stage? Or is your assumption for point of sale different from what's embedded in your guidance for the season?
MohanMaheswaran: No. I think it's a safe assumption. Our POS has been doing quite well as I mentioned of Semtech LoRa, it grew last year and so that's a positive sign. The one thing to remember is if the supply chain is impacted by coronavirus and we can't give enough material or lead times extend out, I would expect our, us to try to actually increase our inventory levels both internally and in our channel but at this point in time I don't think there's any reason to do that. I think at the moment we would expect the same type of POS and channel inventory numbers.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your question.
CraigEllis: Yes. Thanks for taking the question and guys thanks for all the information on the comp regarding LoRa and the other businesses. Mohan, I just wanted to start with a question up with LoRa. First just asking about the midpoint of this year's revenues at $105 million. As you've talked about the business potentially picking up some high-volume design wins. Do you forecast that any of that type of revenue conversion would be in $105 million or how do we think about when some of those higher volume wins might hit?
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. We are anticipating the higher volume kind of home consumer wins to be more second-half, Craig. And really, they're not yet I think heavily in the numbers. So I would say that there's upside there, but the current numbers this guidance assumes continuation of the good progress in most of the smart metering, a smart building, smart agriculture kind of more long-term kind of use cases in industrial IoT and things like that. So it's still pretty good growth but obviously if smart home and smart consumer starts to play in then that could impact it and suddenly, we believe that in the second half will start to be able to see some of that.
CraigEllis: That's helpful. And then the second question is really about the end points of the range so at $90 million sales would be up about $16 million or 22% at the 120, $46 million or 62% year-on-year. As we look at those end points what are some of the bigger swing factors from low end to high end? Is it macro? Is it some of the high-volume items before macro? If you can just help us sort that out that would be quite helpful.
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. The macro, I don't think really plays into it other than if there's a really a big shift in something like we saw China first off of last year. I don't think that it's such a huge impact. I think the bigger impact is in conversions running of the POCs, the proof of concepts that the pipeline that we have which is fairly substantial. It's converting those into deployments and real revenue and we've already seen that can be pushed out sometimes. And obviously with the coronavirus and things like that we are seeing a little bit of a delay and in some of the proof of concepts and things like that. So I think that's probably the bigger impact than over anything else at the moment. So we just have to wait and see how it plays out, but certainly in the second half we're anticipating that most of the kind of macro issues would have gone away. The coronavirus hopefully would be stabilized at least then by that point and I think we should be in good shape to see kind of a return to regular mode what we consider normal growth for our IoT business and LoRa business.
CraigEllis: Thank you and then a couple of clarifications for Emeka. Emeka regarding the new product impact topics in the fiscal fourth quarter. Was that in assets or was that something else? Can you just clarify what's going on there?
EmekaChukwu: Yes. It's pretty - it's mostly has to do with just the timing of year when we sent our stuff for [Indiscernible] yes, so it had to do mostly with the mask sets.
CraigEllis: Great and then with regards to gross margin, I think you had indicated from the first quarter you'd expect gross margin to rise to the year. Can you provide some further color giving us a sense for the magnitude of increase if possible and it seems like signaling integrity should build quite strongly through the year? Is that really the primary variable or would it be the degree to which LoRa is either at the low end or the high end of the range or other factors? Thank you.
EmekaChukwu: Yes. So when we look at a gross margin, I'm actually excited about it because when I look at the growth drivers that we've talked about, we've talked about LoRa, we talked about data center even within protection we've talked about the industrial applications are hoping to see a lot of growth out of that for protection. So all of those are things that are supposed to help drive our growth margin expansion. The only thing that we have as a headwind for gross margin expansion if you will be the fact that overall demand is at lower levels right. So we still have some manufacturing equipment and people in operations group some are - some fixed expenses that we have to absorb. So my expectation would be that a combination of more revenue from our growth drivers and then seen overall demand coming back that should be pretty good for our gross margins as to the exact number at this point, I will probably expect us to head more towards the 62% and hopefully depending on how things proceed we might actually exceed go above our 62%.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
MitchellSteves: Hey. Thanks. I had two questions. The first one, just to clarify, just on the guidance of the $10 million. I just want to be clear about what's - and is that entirely China? Are you guys making an assumption that some demand will erode in the other geographies outside of China?
MohanMaheswaran: That's the total - that's the global picture. So it's not just China. I would say that because China was the first to be exposed to coronavirus. The impact, it's more easily measurable because they delayed New Year by a week and it's been - it's taking time for their capacity to come back online, whereas other regions haven't really been impacted yet. And I think that's still potentially to come, but I think across the board what we've seen is $10 million is about right number for our Q1 demand.
MitchellSteves: Okay. And then the second one is just on the overall full year, I realize you guys are not going to guide a full year, but how do you - how are you guys thinking about the smartphone shipment environment now for calendar year '20?
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. That's - a small funds is a tough one, Mitch, mostly because we're actually quite optimistic that the changing work landscape as people become more mobile and maybe do less social interaction will drive a need for more devices particularly phones and tablets and PCs and that type of stuff. So and currently the demand looks fairly healthy from what we see. So we're getting more positive I think and not only the device mobile devices, smartphones but also on kind of other peripheral wearables and accessories and that type of thing.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
HarshKumar: Yes. Hey, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. Two questions. A couple of the companies that have sort of pre announced have talked about demand in China going back to sort of normal levels or pre coronavirus levels. I was curious if you have also seen that? Then I had another question on LoRa.
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. I would say, Harsh that it's definitely improving. I'm not sure I would say it’s back to pre-virus levels, but I think it's improving. Bookings are strong, indications of strong - indications of potential stimulus are also therefore infrastructure and as we know typically when China invests in infrastructure it's normally advanced technology kind of stuff. So we'd expect 5G and PON and data center and IoT and those types of things to get the heavy influx of monies and so that would be helpful. But, yes, I would say that it's improving. Remember, the coronavirus impact, the China is just coming out of that. I mean at least get improving and so they're not back at full capacity. And I think that's important to understand. So I don't think that demand levels are quite what they were. I would say they're at best 70% to 80% at the moment.
HarshKumar: Okay and then, Mohan, thank you for all the color you gave on LoRa by funnel typed et cetera. Maybe you could talk about what kind of applications you're seeing pick up and/or expect to see a pickup in this year? Would it be mostly consumer or would it be mostly industrial? And is this a year, calendar year call it 2020 that we see the US inflection?
MohanMaheswaran: Yes. So the use cases I think are still more in metering, smart building, smart environment, smart water, industrial IoT kind of applications, Harsh, at the moment. But the pipelines of opportunities we have suggest that we're going to add to that very quickly in the smart home area. And I think that's predominantly US driven segment. Some in Europe and then I think supply chain logistics, smart logistics which is predominantly a European driven region, Europe is the major driver for that segment. And then smart city which is fairly broadly spread. So the encouraging thing about LoRa really is it really truly is a geographical, true global technology.We see use cases across every single region including likes of rest of Asia and Australia and Taiwan and Malaysia and Singapore and so a very, very broad range of applications and a very broad geographical base. So and that's part of the goodness about the opportunity we have. Of course, there are some really big opportunities that will be the catalyst as I mentioned before when they happen, I think you'll see the impact of it. But at this point in time, I would just say that they are more US-based.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please proceed with your question.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi. This is [Vahid] for Hamed. Thanks for taking your question. First one, you were mentioning the LoRa grows out of China. I was wondering if you could provide some color on what the growth looks like outside of China right now.
MohanMaheswaran: LoRa growth outside of China is looking positive. I think it was, I would say that it's relatively small. I mean depending which way do you look at but China is still the biggest revenue driver for LoRa. And so that's why I focused on it but yes across the board, I would say LoRa is still doing quite well from a gateways deployed standpoint, from a number of networks deployed. The type of use cases we are seeing; the opportunity pipeline as I just mentioned is very broad geographically spread. In fact, if I take out China, China is about 23% to 25%, if you take out China, the rest of the 75% is in spread across the different regions with Europe being the second largest region and then Americas and then rest of the rest of Asia.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay. Thank you for that. And then the next question and you've been saying about how there's, you've seen a recovery in China. I'm just curious what trends you're seeing outside of China, in Italy and America and in Europe in general? The last few days in few weeks.
MohanMaheswaran: Well, outside China, as I say, I think it's a little bit difficult to call what demands, what's going to happen with demand. We don't see a slowdown in data center market at the moment. We don't see a slowdown in IoT, but I think that in general the US and Europe is just kind of getting to grips with the coronavirus. And so we may see some softness there. I think and that's kind of why we guided taken out $10 million of our Q1 guidance is really to try to ensure we encompass any of that because there will be some. We don't know exactly how much right.Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Mohan Maheswaran: So in closing, our fiscal year 2020 proved a challenging year for Semtech. We believe the strength of the secular drivers behind our key growth engines remain intact. We enter fiscal year 2021 with a number of exciting new product platforms targeted at the data center, Internet of Things and mobile segments. Given our diverse product offering, balanced end market approach and strong customer relationships, we expect to see another strong financial performance in FY21. With that we appreciate your continued support of Semtech and look forward to updating you all next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation. And have a great day."
