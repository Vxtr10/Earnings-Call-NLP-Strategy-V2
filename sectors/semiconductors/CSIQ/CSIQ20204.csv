"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Canadian Solar's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ajay, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Isabel Zhang, IR Manager at Canadian Solar. Please go ahead.
Isabel Zhang:
Shawn Qu: Thank you, Isabel, and hi, everyone. Welcome, and thanks for joining us today. 2020 was a very challenging year, not only for me, for Canadian Solar, but also for everybody. But it is also a strong one for our business - for the solar business, entirely. We delivered 11.3 gigawatts in shipments, $3.5 billion in revenue, and 19.8% in gross margin. We also achieved diluted EPS of $2.38. I would like to thank our team for their focus and great work during this challenging year. In Q4, we delivered 3 gigawatt of shipments, which was towards the high-end of our guidance. We also achieved $1.04 billion in revenue, and 13.6% in gross margin, both ahead of our expectations. Before Yan, Ismael and Huifeng go through our quarterly results in more details, I would like to share some thoughts on the solar market and Canadian Solar's strategy. Now, let's turn to the slide number 3. We are at an inflection point in which solar grid parity is met with growing societal awareness of the urgent need to decarbonize the global economy. Solar energy has been the largest decline in levelized cost of electricity among all sources of electricity over the past decade, and now has the most competitive LCOE according to independent third-party calculations. Likewise, over the past few quarters, we have seen several major economies commit to concrete decarbonization targets, and the increase in frequency of natural catastrophes related to climate change is also adding a high level of urgency. These factors are significantly accelerating demand for solar assets with no near end in sight. To give you some perspective, annual solar installation was around 7 times to 9 times what they were a decade ago. Yet average solar penetration at this moment remains at just 3%. At the penetration or as the penetration of solar energy and other renewables continues to increase, it will create new market opportunities such as in battery storage. This is a market in which Canadian Solar has become an early mover and has a distinct competitive advantage. I will talk more about that later on. Now, let's move to Slide 4. Now, under this backdrop, our growth strategy remains unchanged. Firstly, we're investing - or we invest in long-term growth and expanding our capacity across the supply chain. Secondly, we are growing our project development market presence and optimizing our project monetization strategies. Lastly, we are executing on multi-year growth areas, including energy storage.
Yan Zhuang: Thank you, Shawn. In 2020, we delivered 11.3 gigawatts in shipments, up 32% year-over-year. CSI Solar revenue was $3.1 billion, including around $0.2 billion from China Energy which was formerly reported as part of the Energy business. In Q4, we delivered $785 million in revenue and 13.5% in gross margin, better than our expectations, as we were able to mitigate some of the cost pressures with increases in average selling price. Turning to Slide 8, I'd like to update you on the cost situation, which has not improved a great deal since the last quarter. Polysilicon prices remained elevated in Q4 and recently increased by another 33% based on PV Infolink's data. Prices of most commodities, which include those used by solar modules, continued to increase. And the Chinese RMB, which accounts for the majority of our costs, has continued to appreciate against the main market - the main basket of currencies, which we are exposed to at the revenue level. With cost currency appreciated and revenue currency depreciated, our margin has been squeezed. On the positive side, with capacity expansion, solar glass prices have started to come down, and we expect it to decline further during the year. We've also been working closely with our logistics partners to lower our transportation costs. We expect this will help us gradually reduce some costs through the year. And importantly, we've been working closely with our customers, transparently communicating the changing dynamics in our supply chain, which has allowed us to increase prices and share some of the cost burden. Turning to slide number 9; it is important to understand that we are approaching the bottom of the solar cost curve. The era of ever-declining solar module prices is largely behind us. In fact, near-term, as we have seen, prices are actually going up. This is driven by three main factors. First, the cost of solar has declined by more than 95% over the past two decades, driven by a combination of technology and scale of manufacturing, allowing us to move from a subsidy to a market-driven industry. As Shawn mentioned, solar PV is already the cheapest way to produce electricity in most markets and solar LCOE will continue to decline, driven by technology advancements and efficiency gains. Second, the cost of solar modules as a percent of the total system cost has declined from over two-thirds to decades ago - a decade ago, to a third of the total system cost today. So the margin of benefit from further reduction in solar module prices is very small. And third, demand for solar assets is very strong.
Ismael Guerrero Arias: Thank you, Yan. I'm proud to report that we achieved 1.4 gigawatts in project sales in 2020, which exceeded our target. In Q4, we closed over 300 megawatts in project sales, spanning the US, Mexico, Japan, Canada and Italy. Meanwhile, we've increased our total project pipeline to over 20 gigawatts from 15 gigawatts one year ago. Please turn to Slide 11. We are seeing that the demand of solar projects, including hybrid solar plus storage, is increasing dramatically. As one of the few standalone global renewables project developers, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trend. Specifically, we are focusing our strategy on the following three areas. First and most importantly is growth. We are expanding our development activities across different geographies and signing PPAs with a growing variety of power purchasers. We are expanding our permitting and interconnection abilities and strengthening our financial capability to support expanded growth. Recently, we announced the launch of the Japan Green Infrastructure Fund. This is a new development platform that will allow us to accelerate our project development growth in the Japanese market. Note that this is different from the Canadian Solar Infrastructure Fund, which is also sponsored by Canadian Solar, as CSIF holds operating assets only. Overall, we will continue to expand our pipeline and achieve around 20% compound growth in project sales over the next five years. This means, we are currently targeting over 4 gigawatts of project sales by 2025, around 3 times what we did last year. Second, we have been optimizing our project monetization strategy, from developing and selling projects to retaining minority ownership in projects in certain markets. As I said last quarter, we expect to enrich the Canadian Solar ecosystem to capture additional value through the project lifecycle. We are doing this through capturing the recurring revenues from power production and sales, operations and maintenance or O&M, asset management services, EVC . Currently, we have around 150 megawatts of proportional assets retained, 2.2 gigawatts of O&M projects in operation, and an additional 1.7 gigawatts of contracted O&M projects.
Huifeng Chang: Thank you, Ismael. Please turn to slide 13. We delivered Q4 revenue of $1.04 billion, up around the 13% over last quarter. Gross margin in Q4 was 13.6%, well above our guidance of 8% to 10%. While there were various unfavorable dynamics in Q4 that outpaced our higher module ASPs such as the surge in material and logistical costs and appreciation in RMB, we worked hard on our customer engagements and optimized our supply chain to achieve an outcome that came in well above our own expectations for the quarter. Additionally, we successfully closed more than $370 million of project sales in spite of the challenges of the pandemic. To cap off the year, as Shawn mentioned, in 2020, we drove 30% higher volume for module shipment and achieved an overall gross margin of 19.8%. Equally important, over the years, we have built up two strong business units to better capture our performance, we have revised our segmented reporting this quarter. Firstly, CSI Solar, which represents our business unit pursuing the carve-out IPO ; and secondly, Global Energy. This business captures the project sales and the recurring income from ownership retention and contracting long-term services such as O&M and asset management. To help investors better understand our battery storage growth story, we are going to present additional information for the new business respectively within the two segments. On the CSI Solar, we have storage integration service revenue; and on Global Energy, we will present storage pipeline. Within Global Energy segment, we are not splitting up project sales revenue on the battery storage component from the solar component, as solar hybrid power plants are typically considered as a single inter-linked investment. While Global Energy will continue to report revenue based on projects sold, storage integration service revenue on the CSI Solar will be captured based on construction milestones. To give you more color on the announced storage contracts we signed earlier, we expect that the CSI Solar storage revenue contribution will accelerate starting from second quarter of 2021 according to these construction schedules. Selling and distribution expenses in Q4 increased by 20%, more than revenue growth due to cost spike for shipping and transportation. On the other hand, G&A expenses were higher, mostly driven by non-cash impairment of manufacturing equipment; this led to a one-time $12 million charge. Otherwise, our G&A would have remained flattish over past quarter. Full-year OpEx was 2% higher than last year, as transportation cost challenges outpaced tight cost control and lower discretionary expenses. The net foreign exchange gain in the fourth quarter was $4 million. We will continue to reduce currency exposures, particularly against the RMB, and adjust our hedging activities accordingly. Income tax was a benefit of $2 million this quarter; we expect some factories to carry more future tax benefits as we continue with our manufacturing capacity expansion plan. Net income to shareholders was $7 million in Q4 or $0.11 per diluted share. Full year income to shareholders was $147 million or $2.38 per diluted share. Now, moving onto the balance sheet on slide 14; we generated substantial cash from $3.5 billion sales this year, which we re-invested into building a larger operating scale in CSI Solar and in Global Energy. Manufacturing CapEx were $330 million in 2020, lower than our earlier guidance. Additionally, with the CSI Solar pre-IPO investment along, we raised the fresh capital to invest into CapEx that will expand slow  into this year. For 2021, we are prepared to invest up to $700 million  in CapEx depending on market outlook and the conditions. We will continue to retain flexibility to adjust the CapEx spending this year and then prioritize manufacturing, productivity and profitability. So with that, our total cash position remains strong at $1.6 billion, giving us the financial flexibility and improving the cash position to fund a CapEx spending better than prior years. As cash level remains elevated, we've managed to down  our total debt to $2.2 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA, excluding restricted cash remains at healthy level of 2.4x at the end of the year. Now, let me pass it back to Shawn, who will conclude with our guidance and business outlook. Shawn?
Shawn Qu: Thanks, Huifeng. Now let's talk about the guidance, both the 2021 Q1 guidance and annual guidance. For the first quarter of 2021, we expect total module shipments to be in the range of 3 to 3.2 gigawatt, including approximately 300 megawatts of module shipment to the company's all project. Total revenue are expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 16% to 18%. For the full year 2021 we reiterate total shipments to be in a range of 18 to 20 gigawatt, project sales of 1.8 to 2.3 gigawatt, and total revenue to be in the range of $5.6 billion to $6 billion. Our updated guidance reflects our financial improvement quarter-over-quarter as previously expected. The better Q1 profitability also reflects the sales of high gross margin projects, especially in Japan, which we have already announced. We remain very excited about our long-term growth opportunities in solar and energy storage. We will continue to focus on building our competitive advantages to deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders. With that, I would now like to open the call to your questions. Operator?
Operator: Certainly.  We have the first question that from the line of J.B. Lowe from Citi. Please, go ahead.
J.B. Lowe: Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to start on the gross margin guidance, the 16% to 18%. Shawn, as you mentioned, the first quarter to be impacted by some high margin project sales. I was just wondering if you could break down the guidance between CSI Solar and the global energy business? Or maybe give some brackets on what can we could expect on gross margin between the two segments?
Shawn Qu: Yes. I will let maybe Huifeng to handle this question. Huifeng?
Huifeng Chang: We usually do not provide all the details, breaking down to the two businesses, but I can give you some high-level color. The margin is higher on the global energy side and lower on the CSI Solar side.
J.B. Lowe: Okay, fair enough. And I guess what percentage of the of the cost increases that you guys have seen do you think you're going to be able to push through higher ASPs in the first quarter? And then just kind of the outlook, I know, it's kind of pushing into Q2, but gross margin cadence specifically on the module side. How do you think that will progress throughout the year?
Shawn Qu: That's a very good question. I would like Yan to answer this question. Yan?
Yan Zhuang: Yes. Well, that's a very good question that everybody wants to get answered. I think for Q1, moving from Q4 to Q1, on one hand, we still carry some of the low-price orders from last year, but on the other hand, we successfully by transparent communication with our customers and that we successfully raised the ASPs and also, we have some supply chain arrangements helping us to bridge some of the cost level. So Q1, we actually did okay - not a super quarter, but we actually survived. So, continue moving to the rest of the year. We see actually a bigger chance for improvements because we see that the stabilization of the exchange rate and we're also seeing that the shipping cost were likely to go down with the ending of the COVID impact. And also, glass price is coming down. Moving to second half, we're also observing the diversification of the wafer suppliers, basically, the monopoly power, pricing power is going to be weakened. So overall, we also believe that there's so many others, a lot of projects that has been on waiting list. People are waiting for module to come down and now they realized that it's not going to come down that much and that they're under kind of urgent timeline to build the project. So customers are actually - we start to see that customer starts to accept a better module pricing. So this is the overall trend. So I think moving to rest of the year, the margin situation we continue to improve. This is our observation and our evaluation of the market situation.
J.B. Lowe: Okay.
Shawn Qu: Hi. This is Shawn. Hi, J.B. This is Shawn. I would like to supplement on what Yan said. Remember, we provided our Q4 guidance back in November last year. We said we expect the gross margin to be 8% to 10%. Our manufacturing side, the CSS Solar side, the gross margin has indeed more or less in this range in Q4. However, the global energy contributed higher margin, therefore bringing the total up to over 13%. Now moving into Q1 this year, we have successfully pushed up the ASP. However, as Yan said, somehow the material costs also go up. So we believe at this moment that we'll probably still end up in the CSS Solar side and in this range, however, they are high margin. The energy business project helped us to move the total gross margin for Q1 from  16% to 18%. So I guess luckily, Canadian Solar has two wins. We always have the two segments, which usually supplement to each other while we'll help another segment. Now, moving into Q2, we are still focusing our plan to move the manufacturing, or let's say move the CSS Solar gross margin about 10%, getting to a low-teen range as we said back in November. We believe we have a fighting chance, but there are certain factors which one company can't control as you know. However, we are seeing that like our effort in the cost control and also in raising the price showing a bare-improved. So somehow, we'll be able to at least maintain our still  reasonable gross margins. I guess that partially answered your question on how much of the cost increase can be passed over to the customers, or it can be shared by customers.
J.B. Lowe: Yes. That was excellent. Thank you. I will I'll let someone else hop on. Thanks for answering my questions.
Operator: Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH Capital. Please, go ahead.
Philip Shen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Shawn, that was a lot of good detail on the margin outlook. Thanks for sharing that. Following up on that, you talked about how the CSI Solar margins could trend in Q2. Can you talk about how you expect the energy business margins to trend in Q2 as well?
Shawn Qu: Well, the global energy business, that margin depend on which part we'll be able to sell and what particular quarter is sometimes lumpy. And as we said, we sold some high margin project in Q1. We don't expect to sell this similar high margin project in Q2, therefore Q2 will have to do a better job on the CSI Solar side in order to balance out and continue to improve.
Philip Shen: Okay, thank you. Shifting over to storage, you guys gave a lot of great color on that business. So thanks for that. And I think, Huifeng, you talked about more revenue coming from this business in Q2. I was wondering if you could share for the year what kind of revenue contribution the storage business might have and what the margin profile of that business could be? Thanks.
Huifeng Chang: Phil, first of all, talking about a storage business, we have two units: one SSES on the CSI Solar side, which does the system integration et cetera and the other part is battery storage, project development in global energy. The revenue growth for 2021 is significant for battery storage business and they are well-balanced between the two sides: the system integration side and the project development side of that, because the schedule of booking the revenue depend on construction milestone and also on the global energy side as I mentioned earlier, the revenue is mingled with overall solar project development business. So, we cannot give you exactly the numbers and also over the quarters. But what you can do is that you know what the battery storage projects are coming out in the U.S. Right? And then from there, you can get an estimate of the overall size of the business that will start from 2021 and going forward into 2022.
Philip Shen: Okay. Can I add one more if I may?
Shawn Qu: Hi. I would like Yan to further comment from the CSI Solar side.
Yan Zhuang: So on the system integration side, the total solution side of the storage, I'm not going to give you the exact number because of the time schedule for the recognition over the year or into next year, but it's in terms of revenues like the hundreds of millions of dollars level and profitability-wise, it is significantly better than module sales. So, that is not a high CapEx high depreciation mass manufacturing business. It's a solution business and that's also - the percentage of the net profit level is actually very healthy. So it's much better than module sales. That's the indication that I can give you.
Philip Shen: Thanks, Yan.
Shawn Qu: Ismael, do you want to provide more color on the battery development revenue from the global energy side in 2021.
Ismael Guerrero Arias: Sure. In terms of projects, as Shawn mentioned before, it depends a lot on the geographies and a lot from the details of the PPAs  that you signed. What I can tell you is that the projects that we have under construction right now are getting very strong demand. The profitability we expect out of them is significantly better than the average of just  because of the quality of the PPAs we have on then and the quality of the solution we are providing for, I think that everything that we are going to be delivering this year on the storage is going to have very high margin.
Philip Shen: Great. Thanks for all the color. Really appreciate that. One other quick question on the China listing status. Shawn, you gave some good detail as to when it can be completed. But it was a wide range of timing and I know a lot depends on things out of your control. But if you were to guess, do you think it's a healthy probability that the China listing gets done some time in 2021? Or do you think it's more likely in 2022?
Shawn Qu: Well, Philip, it's not a wide range. Actually it's a very detailed, very clear range. We just said that we expect to make the official submission in the next month, which means April. And after that, there will be usually - I mean two to three rounds, sometimes four rounds of questions from the exchange, and just like what you have to go through with SEC review. And after that, the exchange will schedule a review meeting hearing and that hearing, the exchange will approve or disapprove. Once approved, your case will be brought to the China ACC level for registration. That's the whole process. So typically, that process will take - and if you look at in the past year or two years, or we take typically like five to six months period and then you'll start the roadshow . If everything goes according to the schedule, then yes, the timing will be the end of this year. And by the way, the roadshow, it's not like in U.S. like one week roadshow. The roadshow in China is rather long, takes long and that's why we say that we are still targeting to compete the listing in this year. However, the market can change. Also, the regulatory authorities may have additional questions or whatever. Therefore, it won't surprise me or it won't surprise anyone if it gets a little bit split to sort of get slipped to 2022.
Philip Shen: Got it. Okay. Thanks again. I'll pass it on.
Isabel Zhang: Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We'll have our next question from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer . Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: On the project side from, potential projects related to hydrogen, particularly for green hydrogen, whether it's in Europe, Latin America or North America?
Shawn Qu: Oh, that's a very good question. We are very interested in hydrogen and also like a green hydrogen, which leads us into advantages to general hydrogen. Hydrogen is another way of energy storage. At this moment, I can't say that we have a hydrogen pack knowledge to offer yet. We are working with some partners looking for the green hydrogen project. And I guess I will update you once we have a concrete project pipeline. At this moment, all of the project pipeline we mentioned, the nine gigawatts project development pipelines of storage with the chemical energy storage. But that is a mature technology and we have the best and the busy energy - the battery energy systems, and also the system - the total integrated system solution ready to offer. We are actually in the process of delivering.
Colin Rusch: Excellent. That's super helpful. And then as you guys evaluate which projects to retain on the balance sheet and which geographies? Can you give us a sense of what the target financial characteristics are on those projects and how you think about geographic diversity for that portfolio?
Shawn Qu: Okay, Ismael. That question falls into your square.
Ismael Guerrero Arias: Sure. Thank you, Shawn. Very good question. Thanks for making it. Look, the way we think about it is we are thinking only on ingredients where we have a lot of experience and we have a value to add and we believe that the projects are going to be having more value over the time. We want to make it 1.7 ; so we will probably focus on this. In Japan, we are already doing that, as you know. The next ones are going to be Brazil and Italy. If something else is coming up to that, it will probably be another region in Europe, maybe UK, maybe . And we will consider the U.S. also but truly depends on the whether there. Regulatory environment in the U.S. clears up. It looks like the changes that rumors are saying might be in favor of making it easier for the company like us to hold some percentages. But look, it's always based on the risk that you are running by holding the asset and that would experience from the region, the return that the asset is giving you. That's how we're making the decision. And also making sure that we make enough volume on the region because it's not our intention to retain a very small volume overall. Our intention is to retain a small percentage of the big volume. So if we are not capable to retain a big volume on the region, we are not going to be pursuing within a percentage. Does this help you to understand what we are trying to do?
Colin Rusch: Yes. I have a couple follow, but I'll take this offline. Thanks so much, guys. Go ahead, Shawn.
Shawn Qu: Yes, Colin, I would like to add some colors here. For individual projects depend on the economics and sometimes depend on how we think the project strategically situated in order to decide whether we want to return some shares . When I say strategically, for example, there's one project in U.S. that is pure energy storage project, very, very good project. And we actually got very good offer from the investor who want to buy 100%. For that project, we are thinking considering of retaining a minority ownership just because this will be the first energy storage project which we retain ownership in the U.S. We believe that we can learn a lot. We saw  the operation and also to understand a lot better on the revenue models of an energy storage project. So yes, economic indicator is one consideration. But sometime, the strategic importance is also a consideration. So that's one answer to your question. Now second, geographically, we did say in our press release that we are launching another vehicle to whole project in Brazil. We also mentioned Italy, which we are structuring a vehicle. So those are the area we think that first of all, we have high quality projects in scale. Therefore, we can structure a vehicle rather than just the sale or return project on the individual basis. Now, Ismael, at the end of Ismael's comment, he also mentioned that there may be some change in terms of regulation in U.S. Actually, he means the infrastructure bill and whether there will be some new policies in terms of ITC of different ways. For example, direct pay options for ITC. Now, if that happened, then that fundamentally change the U.S. market and now we'll also significantly increase the value of our project in U.S. and also make holding projects much, much more profitable in the U.S. So, we are just waiting - no, we're not waiting, but we're analyzing the policy change in U.S. But we are seeing some very interesting, very encouraging signals.
Colin Rusch: Excellent. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: We have the next question from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please, ask your question.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start, I had a clarification question, Shawn on the gross margins. I think maybe you mixed it up, or maybe I'm reading it incorrectly. But in the back of your press release, you showed the CSI solar and global energy gross margins for Q4. CSI was 13.5% and global energy was 8.6%. And I think in your commentary to one of their earlier questions - maybe it was Phil's around margin cadence - you seem to suggest that margins would be about the same in to Q1 for CSI. And then back up to maybe...
Shawn Qu: Brian?
Brian Lee: Yes.
Shawn Qu: Brian, yes, you have a very sharp eye. I realized that actually mixed up the two sides when I was answering this question. So yes, you are right.
Brian Lee: Okay.
Shawn Qu: For the Q4, the number you should pull up, too.
Brian Lee: Okay. So my question, I guess, Shawn, with that in mind is you're basically saying CSI, I'm guessing because of input cost and probably being up 33%, CSI will be down from Q4 to Q1 and then you're expecting from Q1 to Q2, it improves and then it improves back to 10%. And then when do we get back to sort of Q4 levels? You just put up 13.5% in CSI Solar for Q4. You're implying that you'll be back to 10% by Q2. When do we get back to just Q4 levels? Is that end of the year, you'll be back to, 13% to 14% by the end of 2021 in CSI?
Shawn Qu: Yes, our target is to bring back to low teens and in the second half of the year. Hopefully in Q3. And for Q4, we're still targeting to bring the CSI Solar gross margin to the meeting level. There are some headwinds as Yan mentioned. However, there are also some tailwinds. For example, we have passed through the low-price contract which we signed mid of last year. We have gone through all those contract obligations in Q1; you know, we lost money on some contract but we still decided to meet all contract obligation. So from Q2 side, all - we are signing fresh contracts; so there are some tailwinds as well. So, I believe - yes, team will do a good job to fight with headwinds with our effort.
Brian Lee: Okay, thank you. That's super helpful clarification. I think it just helps everyone for the modeling purposes between the two segments, especially since there is so much focus on the module margin cadence here. Okay. Second question I had was on - if I look at the Global Energy business, again, you did 1.4 gigawatt of project sales in 2020; that's the actual, and then you did a little over $700 million of net revenue in the Global Energy segment under the new reporting. So, should we expect a similar ratio - I guess, like $0.50 a watt implied on the 1.8 to 2.3 gigawatts for project sales in the 2021 outlook?
Shawn Qu: That somehow - you know, it depends on whether it's NTP sales or COD sales, so it's a little bit complicated. But our IR team can - I guess provide you more data for the , maybe after the call.
Brian Lee: Okay. .
Huifeng Chang: Hi, Brian, this is Huifeng. You mentioned about the gross margin for global MSS business in Q4 we reported in the press release. I like to highlight that gross margin number was relatively low as a result of selling of two or three large solar projects. And then, we count all the revenue into - the total value of the project into the revenue and that drove down the gross margin number significantly. So - and again, that is a reason why we hesitate to keep the gross margin guidance but sometimes it depends on the form of the product sells is that the cod or NPP , and then it can be very choppy and others may be confused; so take that into consideration. Please do not extrapolate that gross margin for Global Energy coping Q4 into 2021, especially for Q1. Q1 as we announced the product sales happened in Japan, and the margin historically has been very high.
Brian Lee: Thank you. Okay. Yes, the Japan stuff, I know, can come in at a very high gross margin. Huifeng, maybe last one for me, I'll pass it on. If you can provide - and I know, we can take this offline as well. But if you can provide the actual dollar revenue target or range that's implied by the 1.8 to 2.3 gigawatts of project sales for 2021? Can you at least give us some sense of cadence, is it 40% first half revenue for Global Energy and 60% in the back half or is it more balanced or more skewed? Just any sense of how much of the revenue in Global Energy will show up earlier in the year versus later in the year?
Huifeng Chang: I guess Brian, the best way is to have IR team to help you on the modeling. And rather than just giving a slot  numbers in this call.
Brian Lee: All right, fair enough. I'll take it offline. Thanks, guys.
Huifeng Chang: Thank you.
Operator: We have the next question from the line of Strouss  from JP Morgan. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you very much for taking my questions. Shawn, I'm just curious for your high-level views on some of the recent headlines that have come out about your potential forced labor being used for silicon production in Xinjiang province. Are you able to quantify what percentage of your business might use associated products? And maybe it's a bit of a hypothetical at this point, but to the extent that there are any kind of international government restrictions on imports of silicon from that province - what are kind of the steps that that you can take to mitigate them, if needed?
Shawn Qu: Well, Mark, this is a very hypothetical question. And however, I can give you concrete answer. We - Canadian Solar never tolerates forced labor, and we are not aware of any forced labor issue in our company or within our suppliers. And also, based on the information we have, we don't believe forced labor exists in our company, our - in our supplier. So, that will be my answer to our question. Now, if some regulation saw new laws come up from certain countries, we'll study how to comply with the local regulation and local law .
Huifeng Chang: All right, this is Huifeng. Let me also add that we do not have any manufacturing facility in Xinjiang. We only have one employee working in Xinjiang, who is the manager at our solar power plant, and together with six other employees and from a subcontract, all of them are Chinese . And also for polysilicon, we believe polysilicon facility is full of high-risk chemicals, high pressure cylinders, extremely sensitive to safety; so we don't think it makes sense to have any forced labor in those facility. And we haven't seen any evidence of forced labor being used at our facility . Of course, we are aware of the political climate, if some regulation in place, and we will operate our business in compliance. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, that makes sense. That's good to hear. Thank you very much.
