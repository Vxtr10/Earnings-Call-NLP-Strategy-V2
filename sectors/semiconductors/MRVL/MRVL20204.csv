"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Marvell Technology Group Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program Ashish Saran, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ashish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. I would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?
Matt Murphy: Thanks Ashish and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a recap of Marvell's highlights for fiscal year 2021. Our GAAP revenue was 2.97 billion, GAAP gross margin was 50.1% and GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.41. On a non-GAAP basis our gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.92. Our consolidated revenue grew 10% year-on-year led by our networking business, which grew 22% year-on-year. Revenue growth combined with strong operating leverage from our business model enabled non-GAAP EPS to grow 39% year-on-year. I am very pleased with our outstanding performance during what has been an otherwise challenging year. Our growth initiatives in 5G, cloud and automotive drove results in these key end markets, which collectively more than doubled in revenue from the prior year to represent more than 25% of fiscal year 2021 revenue. We are really pleased with the performance of Avera and Aquantia who both delivered revenue above our expectations. We successfully completed the integration of both businesses and overachieved on our synergy targets. We also made great strides with our technology platform, announcing the jump to 5-nanometer and along with it, the industry's first 112 gig SerDes for Cloud Data Centre infrastructure. This move was a direct result of our multiyear strategic shift focused on data infrastructure and brings our process node cadence to the cutting edge. The power of our 5-nanometer platform and the benefits it provides for customers is evident in our opportunity funnel, which has grown significantly since we adopted this new node. The activity level on 5-nanometre continues to accelerate. And we have already secured multiple leading edge design wins, each meaningful from a revenue perspective.
Jean Hu: Thanks Matt and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue in the fourth quarter was 798 million, 13 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Networking represented 55% of our revenue and storage contributing 41%. Revenue from other accounted for 4% of our revenue. GAAP gross margin was 52.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.9% of revenue, both consistent with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were 423 million and they include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal assessments and acquisition and divestiture related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 283 million just above the midpoint due to slightly higher project costs. GAAP operating loss was 2 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was 226 million, or 28.4% of revenue. For the fourth quarter GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.29. Now turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter cash flow from operations was 158 million. We returned 40 million to shareholders through dividend payment. During the quarter we paid down 150 million of our term loan and the exit the quarter with 748 million in cash and cash equivalents and a total debt outstanding over 1.2 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times on a trailing 12-month basis. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending acquisition of Inphi. For the full fiscal year of 2021, we returned a total of 186 million to shareholders through 161 million in dividends and the 25 million in share repurchases. In addition, we paid down 250 million of our term loan. During fiscal 2021, we also generated strong cash flow from operations of 817 million. Turning to our guidance, for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of 800 million plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP growth margin will be approximately 52.5%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63.5%. We project our GAAP operating expense to be approximately 391 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 677 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 619 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.05 per share on the low end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high end. We expect a non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.23 to $0.31. Finally two housekeeping points, as a reminder, our GAAP EPS is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding when there's a GAAP net loss and calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there's a GAAP net income. Non-GAAP EPS is calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In terms of expenses, you should expect us to continue to invest in our long-term growth with disciplined the resource allocation. We expect our operating expense growth to be well below our revenue growth. Our OpEx increase year-over-year will be primarily due to employee merit increase and the normal inflation items such as the EDA tool . Our outlook for operating expense in the first quarter reflects the seasonal increase in payroll taxes. This seasonal effect is expected to dissipate in the second quarter offset by a partial quarter of merit increase. The full impact from merit increase will be present in the third quarter. By the time we exit the fiscal year, we estimate our non-GAAP operating expense in the fourth quarter will increase in the range of 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.
Operator: Certainly.  Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate the commentary on supply constraints. And I'm not asking the team to endorse higher revenues in the second half of the year. But I would expect China 5G spend to come back in the second half. 5G outside of China remains strong. Sony is going to double their PS5 shipments this year. And then you have continued momentum in cloud, but if the backlog supported higher revenues in the second half, let's say 10% higher versus 800 million in April. Is the team confident that you can support quarter-on-quarter revenue growth to the second half? Or do you think that that will be a challenge just given the tight wafer substrate and assembly and test capacity constraints?
Matt Murphy: Sure. Thanks Harlan. Yeah. No, I think you highlighted some of the growth drivers. So just a few comments, I think the first is we are - we have been planning for growth in our FY '22. I think we're off to a good start for the year. If you look at our Q1 guidance alone, it's going to be up 15% year-over-year versus a year ago. We've got some very strong secular growth drivers. You mentioned 5G, and there's certainly some positive signs, especially for the second half there. We have our cloud business, which is also growing on a secular basis, as well as our new product ramps that actually we also have automotive, which is really off to a good start this year and we see that continuing. So we've got that as a tailwind behind us. I'd say we've been able to drive growth, even if you look at FY '21, pretty consistently. We've been growing each quarter, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Q4 we were able to actually exceed guidance and make up - service some of the demand that was there. So that was that was a positive sight. I think - so I think the messages we've been delivering well, there's been a new sort of increased surge. And that's really where we're focused is working with our supply chain partners to be able to capture that upside above and beyond the growth rate that we've already been achieving. So bottom line answer to your question is I'm very confident that we can grow revenue in the second half, based on the capacity that we've secured and worked hard with our supply chain partners to put in place. And we're also going to look to see if there's upside opportunity to pursue that as well. And that's not only for this year. But as I look even in our FY '23, we're starting to work with our supply chain partners there as well, to really give them advance notice, because we see those trends like 5G, cloud and automotive being even stronger in the out years, with new products ramping new, new customers coming online and we're pretty excited about our future there. So yeah, I think we'll be in - we're working hard on all fronts.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Matt, when I look back at this earnings season most of - most semiconductor companies reported and guided to trends well ahead of expectation, right, so much so that investors right have often complained about over shipments or pull in of orders. But when I compare your Q4 and Q1 against expectations, it's been more measured. I'm curious, how much of this would you attribute to a different end market mix, right. How much of this is due to supply constraints? And then more importantly what changes or gets better the rest of the year? So you can start to accelerate your sales growth. Thank you.
Matt Murphy: Sure. Yeah, I think so that gets a couple things. I think first that it has a lot to do with the end markets that we're in. I mean fundamentally remember, we're one of the only pure play infrastructure company. So we don't have consumer demand that sort of very volatile, maybe good one quarter maybe not so good in two quarters, we don't have a lot of demand that sort of comes and goes. We tend to - and this is sort of by design, by the way, the business model that we've put together is to bring together these various end applications and drive consistent and ideally predictable growth. So while we may not be as flashy in some quarters as certain companies that really have some explosive demand, but then maybe it abates later, we're focused on slow and steady wins today and continuing to execute and grow our company, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Certainly there's opportunities out there to secure some upside, and we're working on that. But I think even if you saw in Q4, for us, we were quite pleased with the overachievement on revenue. And we're very comfortable with the first quarter guide as well. So I think it's more around, we've been one of the faster growers in the last few quarters, and also our end market dynamics, ideally, will deliver more repeatable and sustainable long-term growth with maybe less quarter-to-quarter variation. That's been the strategy.
Vivek Arya: And anything changed in the second half versus what you have seen in the last two quarters? What gets better from here?
Matt Murphy: In terms of the demand or the supply?
Vivek Arya: Yeah, on the demand and the end market mix.
Matt Murphy: Sure. Yeah. Well, I think a couple things are going on. If you - as I indicated in my comments earlier with Harland - with Harlan, we certainly have - 5G in the second half will continue to accelerate. We have - there are new geographies coming online, we believe that the US will –shows very good prospects for the second half. We believe that China as well will go through their digestion phase, and then you have Japan and we have new countries even India's talking about potentially pulling in their spectrum options, so that that's all positive. So we expect that to continue. Our cloud business continues to grow. And we see that continuing both on a secular basis, as well as new products, including our ASICs storage and our DPUs, which are doing quite well, in terms of SmartNICs. Automotive, the same thing, we've got a good ramp going with our calendar - our model year, sorry, '21 ramps. We've got more to come in model year '22, with additional OEMs coming online, as well as expanded content, and even some of the new automotive, I call it the new breed of automotive OEMs, the EV only focused companies really aggressively adopting our solution. So we're positive there. And then we've got custom SSD controllers, both for cloud as well as for our system OEM. And finally, on top of that, our enterprise business has done extremely well. If you look at - which was surprising, but if you look at even our results in last year, that business with our Switch, and PHY products grew significantly, primarily on our own product cycle. And we also are very optimistic about that as well. So there's a number of good things that are happening in our business with that both from an end market as well as a product cycle standpoint. And so as I - as Harlan pointed out you've got to - we've got to go just continue to make sure we've got the right supply profile to meet that but we're working hard on that.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. Matt, I just had a question on the storage business. It was well above seasonal Q4, and a little bit low in fiscal Q1. I guess I'm a little surprised that it will be below seasonal for fiscal Q1 where all your customers are talking about controllers being on allocation. So I guess I wanted to just talk about that. And I was wondering, maybe you can talk about what sort of you see as normal seasonal in Q2. I think typically it's up like mid singles. Do you also have the Fiber Channel you know happenings as well, so can you sort of talk about those two factories? Thanks.
Matt Murphy: Sure. Maybe, Jean, I'll have you answer the first part on storage and then Tim I'll have you repeat your question. You broke up a little bit on the second part of it. But Jean, why don't you go ahead and give us some comments around storage.
Jean Hu: Yeah, hi. On storage side in Q4 we really had a very strong quarter and the performance really is a combination of our own product cycle and also strong end market demand across the board. So in HDD and a Fiber Channel, certainly we see the demand in year line which our business performed really well and also just the broad demand for - on the client side. Two, on Fiber Channel, we do see the demand bouncing back and also the customers are restocking. Because the supply challenges in the last year has caused a lot of problems in Fiber Channel. So Fiber Channel is a little bit lumpy. And then, if you look at the Q1, frankly, the storage controller business, when you look at HDD and SSD, they're actually quite seasonal, it's declining quarter-over-quarter, very consistent with the broad market. The Fiber Channel is where it became really lumpy. The Q4 performance is pretty good and strong, but the customers also are restocking. So we do see Q1, Fiber Channel, again is declining much more than seasonal. But if you look at the overall in the longer term, Fiber Channel business actually is quite stable. So the quarter-over-quarter lumpiness is definitely exaggerated last year by the supply chain constraint. I think you need to repeat your second question because we did not hear it clearly.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Okay. You can hear me now. So I guess the question was just given all the improvement how do you think about what normal seasonal is for fiscal Q2, like it's typically up sort of mid singles, is that the right way to think about it into fiscal Q2? Thanks.
Matt Murphy: Yeah, I think Tim, so first of all, I think we're - we have a - I don't even know what the new normal is in storage anywhere - anymore. But there certainly is a seasonality effect of that. But we're not really guiding out that far at this point. What I want to emphasize though, is that even on the sort of lumpiness of Fiber Channel, which is definitely started I think with the shelter in place orders that went into effect earlier in 2020, there's just been a - it's been a lumpier business than normal. And so it had a very good Q4 and then obviously, we've guided it down for Q1, but if you just sort of step back, storage overall for Marvell is up 10% year-over-year in q1 is what we're guiding. So despite some of the lumpiness - and this is a higher sort of beta business than the rest of our businesses, we're still pretty pleased with the trajectory of this business. And we do expect the Fiber Channel portion to normalize throughout this year, assuming that there's no more supply chain surprises.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, Matt. Thanks much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
John Pitzer: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Matt, glad to see the 10% sequential growth expected to networking in the April quarter. But I'm kind of curious, when you look back at the January quarter, I'm a little surprised that networking was down sequentially, I mean it was essentially flat in line with your guide, but just given the level of delinquencies did the supply problem get worse? Or is this maybe a function that when you look at the networking business there's portions that are just tied to campus and enterprise. And then there's sort of the growthy parts of your businesses, I guess, the growthy parts grow sequentially and there was an enterprise overhang. And as you look out throughout the balance of the year, how do you think about just reopening trade around enterprise and the impact it's going to have on your networking business?
Matt Murphy: Yeah. No, I think as we've said the supply impacts, we've seen a bit more pronounced in the networking business, so that has limited our ability to deliver upside. Like we want to - even then you got to remember too, the compare is a little bit tough because we did have a very strong Q3, I mean you got to now go back to sort of what are you comparing it to. If you remember, Q3 was up very significantly from our Q2 and then year-over-year it was up a ton. So the flat compare - while we wish we could have done a little better, it's still on an annual basis, still growing really well. I wouldn't really break out there was sort of weakness in one or the other. I think we're coming off a big Q3 and then also the 5G was up and enterprises has continued to be up and we've actually seen from a year ago, everything growing. So I think it's more of a sequential issue, and certainly we're pleased with the Q1, 10% up and that the business continues to do very well for us.
John Pitzer: And then Matt, just on the cost side, how much are you absorbing versus being able to pass on? Is it material to gross margins? And is that something that sticks around for most of this fiscal year? Or is that something that could reverse itself in the second half?
Jean Hu: Hey, John, this is Jean. Yeah, I'll take this question. So definitely, as Matt mentioned earlier, we are working with the customers to share the increased cost. And the way we're looking at it is our first priority is to really meet customer demand, especially with the increase in demand for our product. As far as the gross margin, we're very pleased with our Q4 performance and the Q1 guide. And then Q1 guide, if you look at it, it's primarily driven by mix. And we'll continue to improve our gross margin to our target level we discussed during our Investor Day, which is 65%. I think the pace of that improvement is probably different in today's supply constraint environmental versus normal environment. Because we do want to make sure we meet customers demand, increased demand under current supply constraint situation. So the pace will be a little bit different not as we expected during our last Investor Day.
John Pitzer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your question, please.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks, for taking my question. Just want to ask - I think you answered a lot on the storages and January shipments  all year. You did miss some shipments in January. And I thought at the time you're thinking of catching up in April, so as you look to the guidance of 10% for networking, one, I just want to know, you're catching up on some of those January shipments within that 10%. And then I think I heard you say basically everything but 5G ASICs will be out. I was wondering if you could give us any more color as to what the primary drivers of that growth is.
Matt Murphy: Well, yeah. No, on the second part, you're right, the other than 5G ASICs, which were mostly tied to the China deployments in 5G, which were extremely strong in calendar '20. And we're seeing that digestion now. Yeah, but the rest of it is up. But there's not necessarily a catch up per se in Q1. I mean, we are seeing demand increase. And I think we've - we see revenue going up, and we see - so I I'd say it's more demand driven than just well, we've got up to now the demand is load, we actually have a pretty robust demand picture for that particular business both year-on-year and sequentially.
Jean Hu: And overall, to just add what Matt said, overall, we continue to have a similar delinquency, right, so it's certainly a supply chain constraint.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your question, please.
C. J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess to clarify, Jean, are you implying OpEx in fiscal '22 is growing roughly 2.5%? And then I guess for the primary question Matt, can you discuss your engagement with hyperscale customers? Can you kind of walk us through the initial work on perhaps discrete ASICs? And how that kind of relationship is evolving to perhaps more custom solutions across increased areas of processing? Thanks so much.
Jean Hu: Yeah, our OpEx year-over-year you can think about is around 3%, the typical inflation year-over-year. We are managing our resource allocation to ensure we continue to invest in all the growth platforms we have. So that's how you can model it.
Matt Murphy: Yeah, C.J., I'll take your other question. So I think if you even go back to our purchase of Avera there was really two - thesis there on two fronts. One was to be more relevant in the 5G market, and be able to offer full custom design capability along with this semi-custom that we had developed with our lead customer. And as you've seen, that's gone really well. The second was that the recognition that in the cloud hyperscale market that more and more of the - particularly compute based solutions, we're going to go to full custom or even semi-custom, but a need to really have a full ASIC capability. And these are range of applications by the way. These things could be anything from AI or ML chips to server class CPUs, to networking products, SmartNICs, there's a variety of applications. And as I said in my prepared remarks this trend is here to stay, and we think it's good for us. And if there is a world that's post x86, or certainly it coexists with it, where more and more of the compute and more and more of these solutions are moving to very, very customized products and we have all the ideal pieces to support that in terms of our process technology, our in-house IPs, like our SerDes both for short reach and medium and long reach at the at the highest frequencies, including 112 gig and our ability to really partner closely and deeply and be flexible on our business model as well. And what I mean by that is, we can do standard ASICs that are the traditional model you think of, but increasingly, what I'm seeing is, the engagements with the cloud companies are really more partnership oriented, where it's solutioning together, and it's proposing architectures and proposing four different ways to do something and then coming up with a model that really suits their needs. And so I think sort of our go-to-market plus our technology roadmap, and then having all these key pieces, whether it's networking IP, very, very strong compute portfolio with all of our history from the Cavium side and ARM based processors to security to storage, and then within PHY coming in, obviously, the optical conductivity. So I think we're going to - we can be an ideal partner here. And we think this is going to be a very big opportunity and it's going to be one that's here to stay.
C. J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes in the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for let me ask a question. Just a clarification than a question, the clarification just Jean, usually you give a little color on what the other segments going to do. But the main question for Matt is on the 5G side of things, I think everybody knows the digestion period that's going on in China now, some of the transitions going on geographically, and the optimism people have in the second half. But you're really outperforming that during that transition period that we have right now. And it sounds like you'll continue too in the back half. So I guess what I'm getting at is when you think about your company's specific drivers, separated from the market as a whole improving in the back half. Do you think that outperformance you're delivering now accelerates or decelerates? And what are the drivers of that performance above and beyond what the end market itself is going to do?
Matt Murphy: Sure, why don't I take the 5G question then Jean you can comment on other? So yeah, Ross, I think you're right. I mean, we've performed really well on this cycle. We had six quarters of sequential revenue growth in 5G and we were able to power through as new products ramped. And new customers came online when some others may be felt different phases of digestion. So I think we're pleased with that outperformance and that run. The China in particular, deployments last year were very large. And so as you pointed out, I think a number of companies were going through similar digestion, but we do expect this business to accelerate and continue to outperform, for a couple reasons. I think one is our lead customer is certainly gained momentum in some of the markets that we'll be ramping in the second half, plus in calendar '22. So that's a positive sign. And there's also - within them, there's programs where we have new sockets, where content is also its new content for us. And then we have our second customer Nokia, which - this year will be our first full year, not even a full year, it's ramping this year into production with our baseband product. It'll be a full year in '22. And then we have additional content with that customer, which was all publicly announced last year that we'll start to phase in after that. So I think there's - yeah, there's a number of Marvell - very specific Marvell drivers with some of the most important companies in this space. And then even looking beyond that horizon we've got really good traction with our ORAN initiatives. And we're in the mix on a number of very important sockets across all the OEMs that will keep driving growth here. So we're - we feel very good about our 5G position that it can continue to outperform and accelerate going forward.
Jean Hu: Yeah, Ross on the other question, just a reminder, other is largely of our printer business today. And quarter-over-quarter, it's actually going to be just up couple of million dollars sequentially.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question please.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thanks. And I'll keep it to the one question. So Matt, you referenced some strategic meetings within Inphi? I know the deal is not going to close for a few more months. But from those meetings, could you perhaps give us a few examples on how the two companies are combining VIP to go out and target some new opportunities?
Matt Murphy: Yeah. So let me give you a little background on what we did, how we're thinking about it and maybe some broad-brush strokes on the opportunities. Certainly we're not - we're still two separate companies. So I think more to come on that story. And some of the opportunities as well, some are pronounced and some are nuanced. But the bottom line is, first of all, Ford and Loi the founder of Inphi have put together just an incredible team, I mean, we've now gotten exposure to their - through this process, which was great, their key engineering leadership, their key product marketing people, their business unit leaders and also same on our side. So it was a really a very, very powerful, I'd say, joint meeting where we reviewed all of our various businesses, and we were able to identify a number of exciting areas where we certainly can work together. In general, the technology is obviously very complimentary, but we do sit in the same systems. And certainly, there's things like process roadmap, and customers where we can go in together. So I say the net - and the way we - the reason we did this is we're really approaching this as a merger with the Inphi team. And so we're going to bring them in and we're going to look at the really the combined company spending and identify jointly, the best opportunities to get the highest ROI and drive - double the best top line growth. And so what we found is we believe this is going to give us an opportunity to allocate some additional spending in some very targeted areas within the Inphi team to actually accelerate some of their ambitions and growth. And I can tell you, from our side, and my entire management team, multiple layers down is very excited about the team coming over, and their product lines and their prospects. And I look forward in future meetings to actually start articulating some of these in a lot more detail. But I just ended by saying somatically, combined, I think we become much more important and much more relevant in the cloud hyperscale market than either company would have been independently. And I think together, given the system level complexity that these companies are dealing with, the cutting-edge performance they need, the deep sort of real technical and strategic partnerships they're looking for, we believe that this can be as important and strategic a market and probably larger market combined than 5G. And so I think we're - our strategy we laid out at the Investor Day, which was a little bit before Inphi, but certainly was on our mind, which was really think about 5G is this wave of growth that we're seeing right now. The cloud, then following that and certainly Inphi layering in we'll accelerate our opportunities there. And then we have a lot more to share at a later date as well in our automotive opportunities, which is starting with Ethernet, but it's now branching out into other aspects of Marvell, including storage and security, compute, ASICs and some other additional networking type of solution. So all in all, I think the combined company is going to be very, very relevant in this cloud market especially.
Tore Svanberg: Thank you for that context.
Matt Murphy: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland from Susquehanna. Your question please.
Chris Rolland: Thanks for the question. Going to the ASIC side of the business, maybe piggybacking on some that have already been asked, but maybe you can talk about where this new design pipeline is coming from. Is it storage? Is it networking? Is it compute? Where are you getting the most traction there? And then as we look out, let's say five years from now, what percent of your business do you think or expect or would like ASICs to be?
Matt Murphy: Yeah. I think - let me give you the backdrop. So I think the exciting part of our ASIC opportunity and I would even broaden that to say our broader call it advanced technology, opportunity of which ASIC is certainly an important piece, this would be what I would call our five - just think about our 5-nanometer platform has its own potential growth opportunity. We publicly announced this in August of 2020. But we had been securing designs in this technology as early as end of 2019 type of timeframe, early 2020. And so since that timeframe, we've grown this design opportunity funnel to be very significant size relative to anything we've seen before on a single sort of process node. And it's very broad, Chris, I think that's sort of the point I want to make. I think there are - if you go by market, certainly there are 5G designs that we've already won and secured as an example there. And there's a large pipeline in front of us as people move from sort of 12, 14, 16 nanometer type of products, and they want to go all the way down. There are significant cloud hyperscale opportunities, some of those I mentioned earlier. But also in enterprise we've had good success in promoting our OCTEON based CPUs into that market that would be more of a standard product by the way, not a, not a custom. And then even in storage, we've seen some very important customers in the storage market take a leadership role and work directly with us to develop state of the art flash controllers for things like data center and enterprise applications using our 5-nanometer technology. So it's - this is much broader, Chris than just, well, Marvell's got a 5-nanometre thing and they can go offer ASICs with a standard sort of model and that'll generate some revenue. It's really a transformational platform for us, which we're - we could use for a traditional ASICs, but increasingly, we're finding that these custom opportunities that people come and ask us for, several of them have now converted into Marvell products, where we're designing the entire product based on a spec and designing the product for them rather than - and then of course, there's more value that can be captured there, it's a more stickier engagement. And these are all very significant type of opportunities, in particular, in the cloud market. So I hope that's helpful context to sort of broaden it, because certainly, we had a view, maybe going back to when we a bought Avera, this will be great, we can have a nice big ASIC business, but it's turned into much more than that. And yeah, and we're excited to talk about that in the coming quarters as we close designs, and we take advantage of the pipeline that our sales team and our business units have developed, which is extremely strong.
Chris Rolland: And what percent do you think it could be in five years?
Matt Murphy: That's hard to say. And I think it depends on what you mean, like is it - how much is ASIC versus how much is semi-custom versus how much is in 5G, but this is clearly a - this is the future of growth of the company. So you should assume these things are multibillion type of opportunities for the whole platform going forward, right. I mean, this is where we're going to be the growth engine of the company. So it's very significant. These are not niche, one off designs that we're winning, that'll kind of be a nice, sort of headline news product, this is going to be really the driver of the company's revenue growth. So in aggregate, all of this becomes a very significant portion of our future company revenue.
Chris Rolland: Excellent.
Matt Murphy: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Joe Moore: Great, thank you. In terms of the constraints, I wonder if you could talk to - you mentioned substrates as being maybe the biggest factor and then certain geometry wafers, which geometries are those? And then, just as a bigger picture aspect of this, it seems like for Marchex networking chips in general are tighter than other things, even though there's tightness in graphics and being able to grow quite a bit. Is there something different with substrates and things like that where this is affecting the infrastructure businesses more than it's affecting other areas?
Matt Murphy: Yeah, I think on the first question, Joe, it's hard to say. I mean, this is such a dynamic environment, right. We've been reviewing every part of the supply chain as a team for months, right, and we're finding that we solve one issue and then another one seems to appear. And if you even go back to our last earnings call, I remember there was some questions, they're like, well, tell me about the supply chain issue and then you fast forward three months and the US automotive industry is in disarray because they can't get chips, right. So things are moving at a very rapid pace. I will note that we're supplying quite well, actually on our automotive products. So don't make that comment with Marvell. That's more of a general one. But we do see point capacity stress with complex substrates for sure. We see some of the quote older nodes and what I would mean by that this is sort of 5-nanometer, 7-nanometer type of things. These are more going back to call it 28 and above, right, that have different pain points that companies are working with and that's where a lot of this automotive I think tends to sit. So it's - there's not a silver bullet, it's just going to take a lot of hard work. And even things like - I think I noted in the last call, things like wire bonders have - those lead times have stretched, so our OSATs are just having a hard time keeping up. Now they're spending money, and they're certainly adding capacity, and we're engaged in that planning process to make sure we're okay. But that's maybe a little bit more detail on that side. And then what was your second question?
Joe Moore: Yeah. No, that was basically the question is just is there something different?
Matt Murphy: On the networking shift, yeah.
Joe Moore: Yeah, I mean graphics chips are in short supply, but people are kind of growing 20% faster than they thought and then constraint at that level, where it seems like the networking shortages are just as severe. We're hearing about it from your customers, but demand doesn't seem to be on that kind of crazy trajectory.
Matt Murphy: Yeah, it's hard for me to benchmark, since we're not in the graphics business. It's a little bit of a different scale. But certainly the complexity level of these products, when you look at just the complexity of the substrates alone, I mean, I think the number of layers, if you go to these advanced products, and call it 14, 16-nanometer and below have probably doubled in terms of the complexity of the substrates, and they're just extremely large die. These are 1000s of IOs and some of these dies are virtually the size of a credit card. So you've just got very low die for safer and you've got a lot of demand. And it's been difficult for people to keep up. There's also test constraints, the test times on these things are very long because of the complexity of the product. So there's just - maybe that's the reason, but I run an analogue business and I run Marvell, but I've never run a graphics business.
Joe Moore: Just comparing contrasting, that's very helpful. Thank you so much.
Matt Murphy: Yeah, you're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko. Your question, please.
Srini Pajjuri: Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey, Jean, I have a question on OpEx and also on the margins. I guess as you ramp some of this 5-nanometer designs, and as you engage more in 5-nanometer, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about OpEx, if there's going to be more volatility as you go forward? And also, I guess, as we go to the second half of this year and beyond and 5G and ASICs become bigger portion of your revenue. Do you see any further opportunity to improve your gross margins from these levels? Thank you.
Jean Hu: Yeah. On OpEx, right, our team has done an excellent job to manage operating expense, but you're right, there's some variability quarter-over-quarter due to the project cost. And also, we're working with our customer together, sometimes the customer portion of that may accelerate or push out. So there are variations, but I feel quite comfortable. Look at the overall for fiscal '22. We can manage OpEx at the same time investing. So for instance our Q4, our OpEx is slightly higher because project cost, but we'll manage overall. On the margin side, I think our number one objective is really to meet the demand. We have significant opportunities for the company and we have increased demand across all the growth platforms, as Matt mentioned, the 5G, cloud and also automotive. So that's actually our number one objective and we certainly will continue to improve gross margin and make sure we get the most margin dollars out of our business.
Srini Pajjuri: Got it, thanks Jean.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day."
