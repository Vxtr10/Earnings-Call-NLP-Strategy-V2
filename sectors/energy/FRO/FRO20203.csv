"Lars Barstad: Good morning and good afternoon. Welcome to Frontline’s Third Quarter Earnings Call. This is my first call in the hot seat. I’m both excited and honored to serve our companies in this capacity. Frontline’s long-term strategies are well cemented by the board and we run a very professional organization that has easily adapted to this management transition. This has been a volatile quarter and an extraordinary year-to-date. I’m tempted to bring in back zones, but they seem to become common to the shipping industry. The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected us all. And even though we still need to endure the situation a bit longer, there is no glimmer of hope in the horizon.
Inger Klemp: Thanks, Lars. And good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentleman. Let’s now turn to Slide 4 and look at the income statement. Frontline achieved total operating revenues, net of voyage expenses of $178 million in the third quarter and also an adjusted EBITDA of $108 million in the third quarter. Frontline reported net income of $57 million, or $0.29 per share, and adjusted net income of $56.4 million, or also $0.29 per share in the third quarter. The adjusted net income this quarter decreased about $160 million compared to the previous quarter. And that was primarily driven by a decrease in our time charter equivalent earnings due to the lower reported TCE rates that Lars went through in the third quarter with also more of five days in this quarter due to dry docks of four vessels. We also recorded a $13.9 million increase in ship operating expenses that was mainly due to increase in dry docking costs of $4.3 million also increased in repairs and maintenance of $2.1 million and we also had $4.8 million additional crew costs due to COVID-19. In addition, we also had a reduction of $12.4 million as a result of that we  in the second quarter . Let’s then take a look at Slide 5. We have completed loan facilities in a total amount of approximately $920 million during 2020, whereof $725 million out of that was fund to refinance four existing loan facilities, which were due in December 2020 and the first half of 2021. But also, we have completed two financings over $196 million to finance new vessels. All these loan facilities were done at attractive terms with LIBOR plus 190 basis points or even better, maintaining our competitive cost structure.
Robert Macleod: Thank you, Inger. So, let’s move over to Slide 8 and the recap of the third quarter, in the tanker market. So, global oil demand bottomed in May and in June, we’re already in recovery and demand surpassed supply amidst deep cuts by OPEC and other key producers. The oil markets switched from inventory built to inventory draws. This can be seen on this slide at the bottom left with the yellow bars. Subsequently, OPEC+ increased production slightly, which kept the cut significantly below Jan 20 levels and the draw cycle continues. When in draw mode, it’s normally the expensive barrel that draws first, and this is typically floating storage. The majority of OPEC cuts have been geographically centered around the Middle East Gulf. This has led to recovering economies in particularly in Asia, sourcing their oil from further afar. this incurs longer-term miles. In the end, this has favored the VLCC markets as these vessels offered the best economies of scale. We also saw continued demand for product storage during the quarter and specifically, jet fuel storage, keeping LR2 markets relatively far. This development is well reflected in our results for the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, we now begin the question-and-answer session.  And your first question comes from the line of from Randy Giveans from Jefferies. Please ask your question.
Randy Giveans: Howdy team Frontline, and congrats again on your promotion Lars.
Lars Barstad: Thank you very much, Randy.
Randy Giveans: So first question around the dividend, you brought it back last year paid a $0.10 dividend, despite a loss following 3Q 2019 results. You increased this to 40 or – sorry, 70% of net income following the first quarter fell in the second quarter, now you cut it to zero despite a $0.29 gain. So I guess why has the dividend payment bounced around so much of the last year? And what will cause you to reintroduce the dividend, clearly it’s not just positive net income.
Lars Barstad: Yes, the derives is not only positive net income. We work in an extremely volatile market and we also normally have quite a good visibility on our earnings going forward. For Q3, the earnings were good, but the – our visibility or when we look into Q4, it doesn’t look too great. And we are in the middle of a global pandemic and uncertainties are quite great going forward. So we decided to keep the cash and the low – obviously return paying dividends the minutes we see that the market stabilized and potentially is ready to return to levels where we see that suited.
Randy Giveans: Got it, okay. So more of just a subjective outlook for the market regarding of the…
Lars Barstad: Our dividend policy status in such a manner that we like to use our discretion when we deem it needed. And in this particular case, we found that to be prudent.
Randy Giveans: Got it, all right. And then I guess one more question for your quarter-to-date rates. The VLCC, Suezmax is down from the third quarter for the fourth quarter, which makes sense. However, your LR2 rates are taking up the higher. So maybe what caused this and how many of your LR2 product tankers are operating in the crude trade?
Lars Barstad: Well, we have eight of our LR2s are operating in the crude trade. We have a 10 operating in the clean of which one is on time shorter. The estimated kind of time shorter return for Q4 is probably listen more colored by the returns we’ve seen on the clean side.
Randy Giveans: Okay. And then do you have an outlook for crude verse products here in the next 6 months to 12 months? Which kind of sector do you see most or more attractive, I know I think you mentioned neither a very attractive?
Lars Barstad: Well, it’s a very good question. The thing is that we’ve come through seven quarters where kind of the crude part of the equation form the clean trade. It’s only the last quarter and a half where the clean product tankers have actually outperformed significantly. So it’s really difficult to call the dirty Aframax is – are obviously now being penalized by the fact that Russia kept quite severely together without that and that hurt the North Sea barrel or the Baltic barrels coming out of Russia. I think I would wait to make that call until the trade flows have normalized.
Randy Giveans: Got it. All right. Well, I’ll let you go. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Chris Tsung from Webber Research. Please go ahead. Ask a question.
Chris Tsung: Hi, Lars. Hi, Inger. How are you?
Lars Barstad: Hi. We’re good. Thank you.
Chris Tsung: Great. Good to hear. I wanted to ask about the decision to sell SeaTeam, could you expand on that a little bit more. And what do you guys also work to divest other JVs like position in Clean Marine?
Lars Barstad: Well, first of all, to take the SeaTeam to look at that. Kind of SeaTeam has been a really kind of good company for us to have more or less in-house for a period of time. It’s obviously not core business. Our business model is outsourcing services like, SeaTeam were offering. But it’s obviously given us great knowledge and it’s also made us understand the markets or the technical management markets quite well. Deciding to divest from that was more related to an opportunity that came rather than something that we strategically wanted to do quickly. So an opportunity arrived and we found a solution where OSM will actually continue to run SeaTeam almost in its original form and take care of our vessels kind of that are under management with the same mindset that they were already inside the SeaTeam. So it’s more or like kind of keeping to our strategies – keeping to our original strategy. With regards to Clean Marine, Clean Marine is an investment we’re still holding. We are not kind of an active owner in that. We were more like having a listening post. So I think I will leave that, the scrubber market or ETFC market is a little bit dormant as you probably understand, but the company is still working. And we were just basically looking at it more as a passive investment.
Chris Tsung: Okay, thanks. Yes, that makes sense. And just looking at the – not so much guidance, but fixtures to date in Q4, the other twos are a little bit hard and two as masses hasn’t typically ended this – happened this way. I guess how much of it is driven by the number of clean tankers versus dirty or I guess what factors are allowing to Suezmax trade below LR2 or LR2s to trade above the Suezmax for Q4?
Lars Barstad: Well, in – as I indicated when I summed up Q3. Q3 was a bit of an atypical quarter, when it comes to how freight rates developed. Because in a normal market, Suezmax will perform a little bit kind of below VLCCs and then a lot of your efforts will follow suit a little bit below that. But this year or this quarter, Suezmax is actually underperformed VLCCs by more than 50%. And this is a market kind of look, it’s not for us in particular. With the OPEC cut, we’ve seen that the longer-term miles have been prioritized or grow. This has put to VLCCs in a much greater position due to their economies of scale. And this has been Suezmax in particular. So I think the rate is a reflection of how severe the situation has been in the Suezmax market, where kind of little opportunity to trade during the quarter and quite kind of harshly hit market. The LR2 have throughout the quarter outperformed literally all the other segments apart from the VLCCs. And this is obviously due to their ability to store clean products and in particular to that.
Chris Tsung: Okay. Just storage clean trade. Okay. And just one last quick question on dry docking. During prepared remarks, you talked about the dry dock schedule for Suez and one for LR2 in Q4. Can you tell me the number of Suezmax in Q4 that are dry dock?
Lars Barstad: The number in Q4.
Inger Klemp: Four for Suezmax.
Lars Barstad: Yes, four.
Chris Tsung: Great. Okay. Four Suez and one LR2 in Q4. Thanks guys. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please ask your question.
Jon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon, Lars and Inger.
Lars Barstad: Good afternoon, Jon.
Jon Chappell: Inger, first question for you just quickly on the dividends. So completely prudent given your fourth quarter rates to date, but you guys are also able to refinance a lot of debt at very good terms at a very difficult time in the market. Are there any restrictions on dividend payouts or payout ratios as part of those new facilities that may have played a role in the decision to suspend this quarter?
Inger Klemp: Nope. We don’t have any reductions in our new facilities, so that this made any different.
Jon Chappell: Okay. And then Lars joining at an interesting time. And Frontline has a legacy of being aggressive when others can’t be. So you’re retaining cash through dividend. Inger’s done a great job shoring up the balance sheet. But you’ve mentioned the uncertainty and the pandemic asset values dropping pretty aggressively. How do you kind of view 2021 in your role and in Frontline’s role in the industry, as far as acquiring assets, chartering in assets, just adding more leverage when others are just worried about survival.
Lars Barstad: Well, as you said, it’s already in our DNA to be aggressive win other comps. We also have a very strong shareholder in our back. So it’s obviously – we’re looking – it’s obviously something we’re very excited looking forward. Right now I think the uncertainties are a little bit too great to be quite honest. Although we are upbeat. There are some risks kind of looking into to the next couple of quarters. We think opportunities will probably arise as we churn and we have these levels particularly on the freight side. And I think we – people will find that the Frontline DNA hasn’t really changed, even if I’m in hot seats to fill it out by.
Jon Chappell: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks Lars. Thanks, Inger.
Lars Barstad: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of  investor. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Two things, one, you mentioned the unwind from the contango storage situation. Could you tell us what you think the percentage of that has occurred? And then secondly, Libya has gone from basically not exporting much of anything, so I read the other day, it’s over 1 million barrels a day. Is that providing us some support before rate wise for the Suezmax market in the Eastern Mediterranean?
Lars Barstad: Thank you. The two really great questions. Firstly, the floating storage. In our presentation on Slide 8, we have some data there from ClipperData or Clipper Data. The way I look at or we look at storage is, we look at the storing for an extended period of time. So we’ve put the bar of 21 days. Those levels peaked north of 100 million barrels. Now we’re down to 60 million barrels. So there is a 40% decrease. How much oil – when kind of that is finished, it’s difficult to tell, because there’s also something about the structure of not only the crude curve, but also of the market itself. As I also think, I mentioned, we have like a record amount of sanctioned barrels or sanctioned production in the world, which probably calls for a bit more floating inventory of oil inventory than we normally would observe. But it’s on its way down. And I think, we’ve at least taken off the 42%, maybe even 50% of the floating storage. With regards to Libya, Libya has been really exciting and quite surprising actually. So they’ve managed to ramp up and I think the last numbers I saw it was up to – they’ve been able to 1.2 million barrels per day. This has indeed made it far more interesting to be as soon as ex shorter than they have been for the last couple of months. So we do see a lot more problems appearing in the markets. We also see opportunities arising. A lot of these barrels are or have been for awhile now actually been going East. And that is, like a perfect fit for the Suezmax size of vessels. So yes, it has supported the market in the Mediterranean significantly.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Greg Lewis from BTIG. Please ask a question.
Greg Lewis: Yes. Thank you and good afternoon and then Lars congrats on the position. I guess, I just had kind of a broad question. I mean, it was kind of talked about people focused on the dividend, rightfully. So I guess I’ll ask it a different way as I look at Frontline and the company looks like it trades on – depending on what valuation metric and I know you don’t want to talk about NAV, but we can look at like something like more Wall Street like EBITDA and the companies that are premium, and the company’s been able to leverage that premium to grow and be opportunistic over time. So just kind of curious, what do you think drives that premium?
Lars Barstad: So what drives our relative pricing to our product is about…
Greg Lewis: Correct. So, yes, like if you wanted to go out and buy a company, I mean, it’s good to be at a premium if you want to do it. And so I’m just kind of curious how you think about that, because it definitely gives you opportunities? So just kind of curious how you think about that?
Lars Barstad: Well, I think it’s – first, there are many factors that decide on our pricing. Some are kind of maybe not in our making it’s – we’re a preferred stock where our liquidity is high and so forth. We also have extremely low cash breakeven levels. We have a relatively high leverage, which gives you relatively quickly bang for the buck whenever the market moves. And historically, we have proven to be quite rewarding towards our shareholders. I know we probably said this every quarter, at least ever since I joined Frontline in 2015. but when you invest in Frontline, you invest together with our main shareholder. You’re not the kind of a sole investor in a big corporation and his history for being interested in your terms on the dollar is well-known. So, I think that’s postulate, I would assume, it’s a difficult number to breakdown.
Greg Lewis: Okay, great. And then just as I think about that as your – as the companies out there, and clearly, you kind of laid out the way to move forward and that hey, the market’s not good now, but there’s reasons to be constructive in the out years. Is the company, I mean, in realizing you have a pretty attractive fleet right now, all good age, big, should we be thinking – are there going to be opportunities to come? Is there any M&A opportunities do you think that could develop over the next six to 12 months, or it’s kind of been all the same players for the last five plus years, and you don’t really see any potential for consolidation?
Robert Macleod: There is always potential for consolidation, but there is always done again, the question of price and opportunity, of course. The markets have actually consolidated, but maybe not in the way that the investors would want it to do and that’s more like in bigger pools are being built on the kind of trading entities are growing and so forth. So, the amount of kind of sole owners trading three or four ships has maybe not reduced, but at least their tonnage have been consolidated in a way. With regards to M&A, as you know and I know that there is always kind of the usual opportunities or suspects or whatever you’d like to call them. We are constantly monitoring them and we’re always kind of in the markets to look at opportunities. But then maybe, not actually, in this instant looking at how the market is performing right now.
Greg Lewis: Okay, hey, thank you very much. Have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Randy Giveans from Jefferies. Please ask your question.
Randy Giveans: Hey, back for more with two quick modeling questions. First for the loan facilities, we’ve done LIBOR plus 190 basis points, so certainly, pretty impressive there, Inger. But following those recent refis is now the plan to maybe, repay the remaining $60 million on the Hemen facility? And then also with the new recent refis in place, what is your weighted average interest expense and debt amort schedule through 2021, in terms of quarterly payments?
Inger Klemp: Yes. We expect to be – did you talk about the ordinary instalments, was that the question?
Randy Giveans: Yes.
Inger Klemp: Yes. Okay. In 2021, the ordinary instalment based on the current loan facilities we have is approximately $160 million a year, evenly between the quarters. And it will be – some slight increase in these ordinary installments in 2021 as we then take delivery of the four LR2 tankers and drawdown on the new 16 Suezmax tankers facility, which we talked through earlier in the presentation.
Randy Giveans: Yes.
Inger Klemp: And your other question was with respect to the Hemen facility? Was that the question?
Randy Giveans: Yes, the $60 million remaining on the Hemen facility.
Inger Klemp: We do have an agreement there in place saying that it matures in May 2021. So, we plan to follow that agreement and they’re going to repay in May.
Randy Giveans: Got it. All right. And then for the total weighted average interest expense, I see your interest expense came down pretty meaningfully from the second quarter. Just trying to see where’s that runs up to in the third or in the fourth quarter.
Inger Klemp: Okay. At the end of third quarter, I think the average cost was around 2.3%. And I think in the fourth quarter, slightly lower, around the same level.
Randy Giveans: Got it. All right. And then one more last modeling question before we can all get to Thanksgiving, I guess here in the States. For the operating expenses, they had a huge tick up in the third quarter. I know you said most of that was due to some dry docking, some one-time crewing cost, just trying to get a sense for a good run rate there in the fourth quarter in 2021.
Inger Klemp: Other than SFL, it would deliver payer in the third quarter. However, we have 22 in the press release that they would also have a kind of one-off in the fourth quarter with respect to this crew cost in relation to COVID-19 or $1.5 million.
Randy Giveans: Yes.
Inger Klemp: Our reduction is of course down from this quarter, which was $4.8 million. We also have stated that we would have our vessels dry dock in the fourth quarter. So, I don’t think you can expect that the cost would come any down on the third quarter with respect to dry docking in the fourth quarter, probably, it will be a little bit higher. But otherwise I don’t think we would have any extraordinary items in Q4. With respect to 2021, I don’t foresee that to be extraordinary in a way. The only exception that Frontline has to make is of course the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in a way, I’d be confident to see it, but it seems like it’s active, it’s coming in place and everything should be pretty normal after awhile there as well. So, it shouldn’t be any costs related to crude changes and that sort of things going into 2021.
Randy Giveans: Sure. Let’s hope so. That’s sounds good. Well, thanks so much. Have a good day.
Lars Barstad: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of George Burmann from CL Securities. Please ask your question.
George Burmann: Good morning, gentlemen. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. I’ve got a few questions. Number one, you used to be predominantly in the VLCC and Suezmax based. Recently, in two years, you moved into the LR2 Aframax area. Can you comment on the reasoning behind that? Number one.
Lars Barstad: Yes. Over the years, the Frontline fleet has diversified kind of into three key or core segments. The LR2 Aframax market or rather the LR2 market is like the VLCC of the clean trade. That has been for a long period of time being like a development globally where refining capacity has been growing rapidly in the Middle East and also in Asia and the cost of refining capacity in North America and then Northwest Europe. Obviously that case stumbled a bit on the fracking revolution, meaning that the U.S. refineries ended up having a relatively cheap feedstock. And we are able to maintain kind of run rates and margins for a prolonged period of time. But the investment initially was out of the displacement between supply and demand on the product side. This is becoming kind of increasingly current again with India claiming to double their refining capacity within relatively short time. And we see the tremendous growth of refining capacity in China, meaning in that China could become a significant exporter of petroleum products. At the same time, we see now refineries in Europe have struggled and are kind of to a largely extent shutting down. So that was – that kind of, it was the key strategy behind. What we experience obviously was that the clean markets didn’t perform as expected. The LR2 has got engaged in the dirty trade, so drawing a little bit below half the feet into the dirty trade. But these ships can be cleaned up and can move back to the LR2 markets, yes.
George Burmann: Okay, great. Next question, you’ve did a pretty big deal last year with Trafigura I believe it was for 10 Suezmax tankers, pretty new ones, 2019 built. Are there still several under time charter – the time charter back to Trafigura and at what rates are those?
Lars Barstad: There’s still five of them on time charter back to Trafigura with a profit-sharing agreement. So – and that’s the level is $28,400 per day.
George Burmann: So, they are good earners for you at the moment, even though we don’t profit share with them, right?
Lars Barstad: Absolutely.
George Burmann: Okay. Then concerning scrapping, you mentioned in your initial remarks that it looks like with the current rate environment, there are many, many companies, if they still transport, they will do so at huge losses. Do you see any openings in the scrap yards recently that have enabled companies to a scrap? And then you made a remark, other than scrapping, what would some company do in buying a 20, 25-year-old VLCC or Suezmax tanker?
Lars Barstad: Well, firstly on the scrapping. As far as I understand, I believe we like to call it recycling. First understand the recycling plants; we’re also heavily affected by the global pandemic, meaning that they have to shut down. There is an increasing activity in the recycling markets right now. And we see more and more vessels being sold for recycling, but not necessarily in . There were a couple of Aframax that have gone, but very few deals to see some Suezmax is reported. And as I mentioned in my presentation, there is a disconnect between the price these vintage vessels are able to achieve for not necessarily trading, but for storage and other activities; than what the recycling companies willing to pay you for this deal. So, with regards to what these tankers are used for, I think I would be a little bit kind of courses to speculate, but obviously there is oil that is transported kind of outside of the normal stock market. And there is, as I mentioned there are quite a large amount of sanctioned barrels in the world right now and these needs somewhere to be stored.
George Burmann: Okay. And then lastly maybe you can comment again, I read that you’re divesting your ship management division and you look to book about $7 million gain here in the fourth quarter on the sale. What are the reasoning behind divesting this division, essentially taking your in-house ship management to an outsourced version? Is that cost efficient for you, more cost efficient?
Lars Barstad: Well, let me explain a little bit on our mobile. So we do have in-house technical managers, but we do outsource the crewing effectively the day-to-day handling of the vessels. So it means that we have an organization in-house, technical management departments, a relatively large one actually that oversee third party technical managers. And SeaTeam cleared to be looked upon as a third party technical manager. So indirectly, we were owning a company that that we normally just outsource to be that way. And this was, maybe explains my comment about it not being kind of a core business and divesting it was basically due to the fact that OSM came in and offered us an opportunity to continue to run kind of the company. The company will be continued to be run in very much the same manner and to the same expectations that we have when it was directly owned by us. And we obviously buy the services of that company going forward, just like any of the other third-party technical managers that we employ.
George Burmann: Okay, great. One last one if I may; what is your average interest rate on the debt you’re absorbing at this point in time? You mentioned that you had a very, very good debt facility there with a very good interest rate and with weights basically worldwide close to zero, I’m wondering what kind of an advantage is that for your company at the moment and how long are those rates locked in for?
Lars Barstad: I’ll let Inger answer your question, those are answer that question.
Inger Klemp: Off the new facilities, which we have put in place now, we went through with respect to term loan facilities there during the call, so that was locked in for – as the margin was locked in for five years on those facilities. And obviously we have also shown our debt maturity profile in the presentation, so you can see how this is going to mature going forward at different facilities. So, the average rate that we are, let’s say having announced today is the 190 basis points in margin and LIBOR on top of that, which is the very low level now. The three months LIBOR is about 30 basis points or 25 basis points in that area, that is what we are looking at. And in addition to that, of course, we have this turn out facility, which we talked about a bit earlier in the presentation, where we have a rate of 6.25%, which we pay on that $60 million, but that is a very small part of our total loan portfolio. So, it doesn’t really mean so much for the average in a way.
George Burmann: So, if LIBOR rates raise, your interest rates – would your interest rate costs would also go up a little?
Inger Klemp: Yes, it will. And we do have interest rate swaps in place as well for $550 million on a certain bit higher level than the 25 basis points or 30 basis points, even though very competitive. So, let’s say, a total expose to raise in LIBOR rates, but does just makes sense? Yes.
George Burmann: Yes. And then maybe a one quick last one, concerning scrubbers, is your entire fleet now outfits with scrubbers where necessary.
Lars Barstad: No. We have about two-thirds of our fleet is fitted with scrubbers as it is right now. We kind of slowed down the pace of scrubber installing with the diminishing kind of scrubber margin to bit of that where the spread between high and low sulfur fuel. I’m going to say it that way, we won’t – we couldn’t easily reinitiate that program in the future.
George Burmann: Do you expect – I’ve recently heard reports about slow steaming. Would that be a positive effect on day weights and tanker demand?
Lars Barstad: It could be. It – I’m not sure what context you kind of – you’re thinking about there. But first of all, during the label leg, when we are empowered, we can many times decide our own speeds. And in this earning environment, we will slow down as much as we can to be quite honest. But there is also a general discussion around when we measure our carbon footprint, how slow speeding could play a role in order for the tanker fleets to comply with the goals of IMO going forward. So – but this is still kind of a bit up in the air. I must admit, we haven’t really looked deep into that as of yet.
George Burmann: Okay, great. Thanks very much for your time here.
Lars Barstad: Thank you.
Inger Klemp: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.  And there are no further questions at this time. Please continue.
Lars Barstad: Okay. Then I just wish to say thank you very much for this call and thank you for listening. Happy Thanksgiving to the ones joining us from the State and stay safe. Thank you."
