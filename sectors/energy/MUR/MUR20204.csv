"Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Murphy Oil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.  I’d now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Whitley, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.
Kelly Whitley: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter earnings call today. Joining us is Roger Jenkins, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with David Looney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Hambly, Executive Vice President, Operations.
Roger Jenkins: Good morning, Kelly. Thanks to everyone for calling in today. Before we get started reviewing our 2020 and looking forward segment of our day-to-day, I would like to address the recent actions taken by the Biden-Harris administration. Murphy like all operators across federal lands and United States disappointed, but not at all surprised by recent actions. Unfortunately, as a matter of public policy believe their efforts is misguided, your submission peaked over a decade ago in the United States and continue to follow every year. Growth in worldwide greenhouse gas emissions comes primarily from the Far East, Southeast Asia and Africa. These new initiatives will punish domestic producers and workers, but will not lower worldwide emissions. Ironically, any policy that includes the Gulf of Mexico actually hurts the carbon footprint. That’s the deepwater Gulf as the lowest carbon intensity of all of the E&P business. Last week, the U.S. Department of Interior announced a temporary suspension of delegated authority for 60 days. It is important to note that this order is not limit existing operations under valid leases and provides a method for obtaining necessary approvals. There’s potential for delay in consolidation of approval authority. However to date, we have been pleased with the progress and are moving forward. Murphy is well-positioned to continue execution of our short-term and long-term projects including Khaleesi, Mormont and Samurai, and our non-operated projects based on approvals in hand discussions with our regulators and progress made in the last week obtaining actual approvals to conduct ongoing operations on current leases. We’ve also seen the past two weeks over 20 approvals given for work in the Gulf of Mexico to not only us, but our peers. Yesterday, the White House announced the pause on new oil and natural gas leasing on federal land and waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices.
David Looney: Thank you, Roger, and good morning. Slide 8, Murphy reported a net loss of $172 million or a $1.11 net loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020. After-tax adjustments, including but not limited to a non-cash mark-to-market loss on crude oil derivative contracts and contingent consideration totaling $159 million resulted in an adjusted net loss of $14 million or a $0.09 adjusted net loss per diluted share. Slide 9, improving commodity prices led to further strengthening and revenue for the quarter. Overall, our net cash provided by continuing operations rose to $225 million in the fourth quarter, including a $13 million cash outflow from a working capital increase. When combined with property additions and dry hole cost of $135 million, including $38 million for King’s Quay, we had positive free cash flow of $90 million in the quarter. Regarding King’s Quay, the producer and owner groups continue to make good progress on the array of legal documents. And we look forward to a closing possibly within the next few weeks. For full year 2020, our net cash from continuing operations of $803 million included a $39 million outflow from working capital. Property additions and dry hole costs of $859 million, including King’s Quay spending of $113 million resulted in a negative free cash flow of $56 million for the year. If we exclude the King’s Quay expenditures for the year, we would have had positive free cash flow of more than $55 million. We continue to maintain a high level of liquidity with $1.7 billion at year end including $311 million of cash and equivalents at December 31. With our focus on cost reduction measures throughout 2020, we’ve achieved significantly lower G&A within approximately 40% reduction in full year costs from 2019. Lastly, Murphy continues to protect its future cash flow with the addition of 2021 and 2022 crude oil hedges, as well as fixed price forward sales contracts for a portion of our Tupper Montney production through 2024. Slide 10, liquidity remains a key focus for Murphy and our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion available under our $1.6 billion senior unsecured credit facility, as well as $311 million of cash and equivalents as of December 31. We reiterate our goal of reducing our total debt level over time with excess cash flow. This reduced leverage will give us even more resilience through the inevitable commodity price cycles to come.
Roger Jenkins: Thank you, David. On Slide 12 as a company, we’re responsible to the environment, employees and our stakeholders have a long history of protecting all and part due to our strong internal governance processes. Particularly proud of how quickly the team established COVID-19 protocols to maintain safe offshore operations with zero downtime or disruptions due to those efforts. Murphy achieved another year of low metrics, including 46% reduction year-over-year in total recordable instance, we expanded our internal diversity inclusion practices and programs, maintain a program to aid impacted employees in times of need through our disaster relief foundation, which we’ve used this summer with hurricane relief on the Louisiana coast. Operations team continue that work on minimizing our environmental impact such as building a new produce water handling system, recycled water, and our sanctioned Tupper Montney project, as well as utilizing bi-fuel hydraulic frac spreads on all well completions in Canada, which results in considerable CO2 emissions reductions. While smaller changes individually, they add up to a larger impact over time. On Slide 13 of sustainability as following at least our 2020 sustainability report, which features expanded disclosures and metrics, key highlight it is our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity that 15% to 20% by 2030 from 2019. The report also outlines diversity and disclosures, workforce development, employee engagement programs. Murphy has also expanded our HSE board committee to include oversight of corporate responsibility formed in – we formed an ESG executive committee and created a new director of sustainability role. We’ve taken many steps and we continue to evolve and advance our sustainability efforts. On Slide 15 on the Eagle Ford Shale business, we produced 31,000 barrels equivalents per day in the fourth quarter comprises 71% oil for the full year production average 36,000 barrels equivalent per day with $197 million of CapEx, which includes $15 million for field development as well. We brought online 25 operated and 10 non-operated wells earlier in that year. The team continued their efforts on improving well performance and high grading production enhancing projects in facility our artificial lift optimization. Murphy seeing an average based decline rate of 24% for all wells drilled prior to 2021, which in our view is very well-positioned. On Slide 16 on the Kaybob Duvernay project, the company produced 10,000 barrels equivalents oil per day in the fourth quarter comprised of 75% liquids in average 11,000 barrels equivalent per day for the full year. Overall, Murphy spent $94 million in CapEx during the year, including plastic Montney bringing online 16 operate wells in Kaybob and 10 non-operate wells in plastic. Also in 2020 Murphy completed its drilling program to hold all acreage resulting in full discretionary future development.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  First question comes from Neal Dingmann at Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Neal Dingmann: Good morning, all. Roger, appreciate your prepared comments on the federal leases and permits. I’m just going to dive straight into that. Could you give your thoughts on just in ballpark, how long you anticipate that your current inventory could take you and more specifically what you all would eventually pivot towards if there was some type of ridiculous permanent federal band or/and once your current assets are worked out.
Roger Jenkins: Well, actually, as I’ve said, there’s a short-term and long-term things that we work on every day in the business. It’s a business that requires communication with the regulator across several factors. We’ve continued to be able to do that during the suspension of authority period. We’re very pleased with that. Also pleased with what’s going on with non-operated work on a day-to-day type basis, which in our remarks today, we talked about some subsea wells are needed to be repaired and that work is progressing as per even with this suspension. We’re well-positioned to start our Khaleesi, Mormont project and continue on actually, we are ahead of target on regulatory there and have more permits than you would normally have for development this time. The permits are given pretty close to the drilling date and historically been that way in the Gulf. So well-positioned there, far as what would we do with some kind of scenario like that, I mean I appreciate that question, but yesterday’s executive order did not mention anything about current leasing. We’re finding that everything that’s ongoing like our project is being treated like an ongoing project. And it’s – way it’s being treated and being worked today, there’s regulatory work going on in a normal business basis today in this building. And so naturally, if there were to be some wild outlandish moratorium, which didn’t do well in the Macondo time for the government at all, we have a lot of flexibility. First step may would be, hey, let’s just stop and have a lot more free cash flow and pay down our 22 notes with this matter, and then continue on it. It wouldn’t be a need to rush in to go try to duplicate things that we all, and that’s kind of our first step. And it’s quite helpful to us in that regard. If we are able to get these projects back going again, naturally we have a big business in the Eagle Ford that can be throttled and change because oil prices in any kind of moratorium like that with the Gulf making almost 3 million barrels a day would make that much more attractive. Our Canadian business is doing extremely well. Our Canadian regulations continue to be very supportive. So a lot of things for us to do to replace the production, if we want to with the capital efficiency and much higher oil prices, but in all, in all, that’s a pretty wild scenario. And the work that we’re doing today isn’t pointing to that a scenario in my view, Neal.
Neal Dingmann: I agree with you. And then just my follow-up on stick with the Gulf, I’m looking at that Slide 22, it just really reemphasizes just how many opportunities you have there. Just wondering Roger, what gets you have so many of these things when I’m looking at all the exploration projects, as you mentioned, prepared remarks, number of things coming on here not even this year, but already planned for next year. I’m just wondering what sort of makes you most excited right now, when you look at all these projects in the Gulf, are there a few that you would point us to, or I’m really curious on how you would think of that. I would like to hear your angle on it.
Roger Jenkins: Well, we built a new area on the slide in that Oso area. That’s where we have Rushmore and Oso and Guilder. That’s a new area for us that we’re very excited about. We feel that we’re seismic advantage in that area. We also have a couple opportunities near front runner. Ninja that we happy about because it’s nearby. We have a very exciting well to drill at Cascade, Chinook in the long run. It’s a downtime false segments in most major Wilcox plays have been very successful. It’s a very big deal for us in the future, very large top of a well it’s near production. And we’re very happy to partner with Chevron in our new Silverback area, which is adjacent as shown in the slide here, adjacent to some acreage that we also feel has that same new feature. This is we’re very excited at Chevron again back to our strategy being a respected company that people want to work with. We’re fortunate to be in a working relationship with a super major that respects our ability and our knowledge and our experience, our long-term experience in the Gulf. So I feel really well-positioned because that’s sort of a company making thing at the right kind of working interest, but helps us de-risk our blocks, if that were to be successful. So those are the highlights there, Neal.
Neal Dingmann: Very, very important. Thank you so much.
Roger Jenkins: No, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Dun McIntosh at Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.
Dun McIntosh: Good morning, Roger.
Roger Jenkins: Hey, good morning. How you are doing?
Dun McIntosh: Good. I noticed on the Eagle Ford spin for next year, $170 million, but a little less than a third of that is going to be going towards what you call field development. So can you add a little more color on what you’re going to be building out there?
Roger Jenkins: I’ll have Eric gets his expertise to talk to you all the way through that and everything you need right here.
Eric Hambly: Okay. When we build our capital program, what we lumped into field development is pretty much everything other than wells. So building pads, flow lines, pipelines, allocations, separators, people costs, things like that. So it seems like a large number, but it really is more driven by the well activity. It’s not like we’re building a massive new facility.
Roger Jenkins: We’re also working on electrification, some other things involving ESG in this business all the time on improving our flaring and reducing always our missions. We have a new takeaway of pipeline in Eagle Ford to further reduce flaring that we’re excited about. So there’s CapEx took in those types of things as well, that are required and needed in the right thing to do at this time.
Dun McIntosh: All right. Thank you. And then for a follow-up on the Tupper Montney grabbed hung in that tin well program sanctioned, but looking beyond that and kind of longer-term with the 6% gas CAGR versus 8% versus the oil over the next kind of three or four years. What are you all seeing up there that you think might be sticky or maybe from a demand perspective an asset basis has gotten a tightened up the most it’s been in five years just kind of looking for some color on what all…
Roger Jenkins: If you look at the data, it was very variable on a very poor basis, very poor of which we did then did some all AECO type business to protect our risk, which worked very well for us at that time. Then the debottlenecking by TCPL, claim they were going to do all this capital work. They did the work both East and West. And there was a time where it was difficult to get the gas to a summer storage facility there. And now that they’ve needing more gas in the country and less capital available by Canadian junior players in Calgary, then the production has greatly dropped. And now we can get the gas to storage, which eliminates this very viable, very, very low, poor summer month type productions and shut-ins, also TCPL had downtime through the years quite frankly and because there’s less 2 BCF of less production, there’s less downtime. So here we are with this big position, best, lowest risk thing we ever had. We started comparing it to low oil prices. And then we decided this would be a great capital allocation for us, also very, very good from greenhouse gas intensity perspective. So we feel there’s a better chance for all to go to 60 and make a lot of cash flow in our oil flat production shale than it is for gas here to get $5, let’s say. Then we found a unique way to book the gas and hedges, it was very advantageous to us and allows us to almost book if you will, free cash flow. Also these reserves are audited – completely audited by McDaniel in Canada and have been for a long time. Eric is a former Executive involving reserve auditing. So I have a top of the line reserve work here, great operations, incredible ahead of it, hedging that we’ve done and a really well positioned in there. This happened over time. Also in Canada, they have switched coal out and have less production and need the gas we get the storage and we have LNG long-term there, which we are, of course, very familiar with in Malaysia and offer – and allow those folks involve with LNG, we’ve worked with before and outstanding reputation to deliver gas in Canada. I mean, in Asia of these years through LNG will help us in long run in my view.
Dun McIntosh: All right. Thank you for all that color.
Operator: The next question comes from Leo Mariani at KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Leo Mariani: Good morning.
Roger Jenkins: Good morning, Leo.
Leo Mariani: Hey guys. Just want to follow-up a little bit on some of those last comments. If I hear you right, sounds like you guys are much more bullish on gas than oil over the next couple of years. And maybe just kind of giving a little bit of look back just on third quarter, you guys were certainly planning on kind of ramping up Eagle Ford here in 2021, when I think some higher expected volumes, when oil prices were closer to $40. And now we’re kind of over $50, here today on oil and gas maybe had done all that much in the last several months and it’s a little bit better. But not as dramatic an improvement, I understand you guys had facility work and there’s a lot more capacity, now it Tupper and summer outlook looks better. But just wanted to kind of confirm, are you just more optimistic about gas in the next couple of years versus oil. And just looks like to you that the returns at Tupper just better now than Eagle Ford, despite higher oil prices.
Roger Jenkins: Well, it’s not at all that way, as far as the bullishness to oil, we still feel oil can go up and especially with all this regulatory. But what we’re trying to do and what we said, was to – we wanted to plan our business on a flatter oil profile in shale, especially, Eagle Ford. And because we’re well positioned there with our high oil percent and very known customer in that area of selling of our oil is needed in that area. We feel that we keep that flat and oil prices go up, we can make much more free cash flow. And we’re trying to get out of the debt business and add free cash flow and successfully how that coming. Also, our folks in Eagle Ford have done a great job on maintaining days and days decline, which I think is very critical. So it’s not that way at all. We see as an increase in oil price as a way of keeping shale flatter and making more free cash flow, which is not uncommon supposedly by my peers. Now in Canada, price has been greatly improved, our cost structure improved. We had like 15 different reasons, why we needed to book that and do that. We’re still only going to be making at, when this project is full out around $500 million a day. So it’s not like we’re turning all gas and making BCF to gas or anything like that. So it’s all about, as we said before, a flatter profile with more free cash flow to significantly reduce debt and higher prices, then the Montney came along on top of that, and you have to say for a project ongoing to go from $240 million to $500 million and fooling around with $80 million CapEx do that really isn’t that difficult. It’s very capital efficient. So it’s more about a unique project that we have is in our face to be successful with our flat profile, with our oil prices to have more free cash flow. It’s that, it’s nowhere around and bullishness on oil price. Is there anything like that, Leo, really?
Leo Mariani: And obviously you guys talk a little about your multi-year ramp at Tupper, kind of 8%, between now and 2024 pretty robust. You guys are talking a little bit more kind of flat to 3% on the oil side. How does the Eagle Ford participate once we get out of 2021 and it looks like you’re trying to maintain Eagle Ford in 2021 at fourth quarter? Is there a ramp in 2022, 2023 or 2024 or are you going to basically wait to after King’s Quay comes on to kind of reallocate CapEx? What’s the long-term plan for the Eagle Ford here?
Roger Jenkins: Our plan today is again to have the flat profile in Eagle Ford to set it up to make. It could probably make $500 million to $600 million free cash flow over a four to five year period and mid-50s oil price. And that’s what we wanted to do today. That’s our plan today. And that really have to do with King’s Quay or anything like that. So again, our strategy, as you know, from most last year was this plan, it’s just so happens that the Montney got so positive for us that we added it on with very little change in CapEx. And improved all – it was accretive to all our metrics or covenant metrics, our free cash flow metrics, it was accretive to everything we did. So we executed all, because our cost structure so low. It’s really that, Leo.
Leo Mariani: Okay. That’s a good color. I mean, just on the Gulf of Mexico here, you guys talked about fairly significant downtime in the fourth quarter. You talked about some downtime moving into first quarter as well. Could you kind of quantify, what’s baked into the first quarter guide, in terms of the downtime here? I was just kind of looking at your guidance. And I think your guys are saying your oil volumes are going to be up around 3,000 barrels a day in the first quarter. Despite the fact that you had something like 18,000 BOE per day down in the fourth quarter through storms and whatnot. So I guess, I’m just trying to figure out if there’s a bunch of additional downtime in the first quarter, I would thought have been up more.
Roger Jenkins: We were well positioned going into around mid-December in the Gulf and very, very well positioned. We had two one-off subsea events happen that requires some equipment to be put offshore and repaired, is one was an operating field and one non-op. That is in works now to be done on both at different levels of completion. And we have that in this quarter to be recovered. We also have some very nice wells being drilled that Lucius operated now, of course, OXY, that we purchased through the Petrobras agreement, through that formation of a JOA. And so that will be coming online and we will be increasing production in second quarter in the Gulf with all that. And that’s where we are on that Leo, it was a surprise couple of subsea events are being fixed and we have wells coming on at Lucius as well Calliope well that we mentioned and doing well.
Leo Mariani: Okay. Thanks guys.
Roger Jenkins: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram: Good morning. Roger, I wanted to ask you about the 2021 to 2024 outlook that you’ve highlighted on Slide 32. You guys have provided an outlook of $600 million in CapEx per annum with a little bit of higher CapEx in 2022 with the development projects. I wondered if you could maybe help us think about the year-to-year trajectory from 2022 to 2024.
Roger Jenkins: Arun, if I wanted to give year-to-year trajectory, I’d put it on the slide. I have it right here in my hand. In four years, we’ve seen two major price collapses in our business and recover back and guiding out year-to-year CapEx. I don’t think, it’s a good idea. There’s no secret that our CapEx this year midpoint of $700 million is what it is. And I think very well positioned to do what we’re doing with that, with all the money that we’re spending, it will not contribute to oil production, shear or gas. And next year is going to be higher CapEx in this year, and we’re going to be dropping down pretty drastically after that. So I prefer to leave it at that right now, a lot happens in a year, but that’s our plan. And through the color I’ve provided on the prior calls about the flatter profile and more higher oil prices allowing more cash flow. That’s our plan. I think the point here we’re trying to make is that, we’ve disclosed the CAGRs, we have our business that we talked about our oil business, if you will, our offshore business, our Eagle Ford business and the Duvernay of course, is almost 80% liquids business. So it’s very, very high prices and doing well. That business is slightly growing, which has been our plan for nine months probably. And the growth is in the Montney, because it’s getting into the Montney book that it was available to us. So through that though, with conservative oil prices through this four year period, but we will have cash flow cumulative above our dividend in low-40s or mid-40s at most. And in the mid-50s, we’re going – we can cut our debt and high for more and that’s what we’re trying to do, working on.
Arun Jayaram: Fair enough. And my second question is just regarding the Gulf of Mexico development program, you guys were sticking with the timeline around Khaleesi, Mormont and Samurai first oil. Based on what we know today, Roger, and stop me if I’m wrong, you’ve received two of the 10 permits for the program at Samurai, number three and number four per IHS. Could you walk us through and I think the rig arrives in April, but do you get started at Samurai and just wait for the incremental permit approvals. And do you think that we could see some permit approvals during this 60-day timeout from the DOI based on some of your commentary that you mentioned earlier?
Roger Jenkins: Thanks, Arun, for that. It’s nothing – I don’t know where the 10 well things coming from. We have a 10 well commitment on a rig to do any kind of work we want for a certain price in the Gulf of Mexico. This is a seven well phase one development. Phase one, meaning for the next few years, I think there’s another couple of wells beyond 23 or something like that. There’s four existing wells in the ground out there. They’ve been drilled in your case in a log everything. There’s three wells, when I talk about this, it’s Khaleesi, Mormont and Samurai, which we work as one continuous field. We have partners that are different in those that not matter at this time, four existing wells, three new wells to be drilled and completed. So you’re correct on a public website, we do hold two drilling permits today. You can’t get the completion permit to the wells are drilled. Completion permits, often lag drilling permits, because the drilling permit is a lot more complex and has been, it’s nothing new all the proper documentation. So it would be not the norm at all to have all this approved. And I think we’re well ahead to have what have now, because we are starting to work in April. And I’m not going to comment on the permits we get. They know we don’t need them with our schedule, if you will. They know where the rigs are. They run the business, they regulate the business. We have a great relationship with the regulator. Also we’re very, very good operators in Gulf and carry great standing on spills. We haven’t had a spill in the Gulf and over four years, a great safety record and incredible record as to instance of non-compliance one of the leading company. So I believe that all helps. And, like, I said, we’re well positioned here and would not have been – now we have submitted all these permits. And as a matter of fact, the completion permits have been come back to us for comments, that’s quite often to ask questions on these permits. So they’re engaged in an ongoing field and an ongoing way. And there’s documentation also when you started development like this with the government to outlay to them that you’re going to develop this and you have to provide that you’ve got a signed rig contract and the sign the ability to put in the pipelines. And they’re part of an overall process that they know about and we are relying on and they know this. And so it’s going as we would anticipate. And we – like I said, based on – it’s only one week, but based on what we’ve seen, we’re working with it and moving our business forward.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot for that color, Roger.
Roger Jenkins: Thank you. See you soon.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Singer at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Singer: Thank you. Good morning.
Roger Jenkins: Good morning.
Brian Singer: To follow up further on the Tupper Montney gas, you indicated you’ve gotten the EUR up to a 21 BCF, and I wondered A, is that a function of the longer laterals. Or can you add more color on what’s changed beyond that? And then B is that, kind of the going forward expectation for wells and as the 11,000 the expectation for lateral length on a longer-term basis.
Roger Jenkins: I’ll let Eric, handle that for you, Brian, and I’ll come back to any other question you might have.
Eric Hambly: Brian, well performance is driven by two things, longer laterals and also better recovery per lateral foot or lateral meter. So if you go back to the beginning of our asset there, we had four BCF wells that were about 5,000 foot laterals, and now we have 21 BCF wells that are about 11, 000, 12,000 foot. Our plan is to have about 3,000 meter laterals for this development program. And so you’re getting a combination of improved performance per lateral foot plus longer laterals. Going forward, we don’t expect to lengthen our laterals from what we’ve been doing over the last couple of years.
Brian Singer: Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is with regards to Slide 32, the slide that focuses on that 2021 to 2024 plan. Can you talk a little bit more about what’s baked into that? Is there a wedge at all baked into either CapEx or production assuming any exploratory discoveries from here? Is there any kind of risking on federal and timing and timing of projects? And can you just talk about Vietnam, and whether there’s anything there that’s baked in from either a CapEx or production perspective?
Roger Jenkins: There’s absolutely no expiration success in the plan. It never has been. And that’s why this talk of delaying and permitting really doesn’t do anything to our company. And as we talked about earlier, we have 15 really good prospects in the Gulf on acres that we hold entered into another project with a super major with acreage that they hold today. And again, the executive order yesterday didn’t really get into that. Vietnam is a field development that is absolutely in place. It’s between 80 million and 100 million barrel project. It can be developed. We submitted the field development plan and working with the regulator there it’s – we’re used to working with regulators offshore all over the world. And projects, it’s about the same. As a matter of fact, people may not realize this, but most international areas copy the U.S. regulatory, we’re very used to it. But it’s a little slower there for that. And when they get that, we could put that into our plan and look at replacing something. But today, it’s not in the plan, this is what we own today. What we’re doing. We’re very knowledgeable about it. We do not have a delay built in on a Khaleesi, Mormont and Samurai nor St. Malo. I feel comfortable with what I understand about the projects, not to do that at this time. I’d say we’re ahead of schedule and Khaleesi, Mormont and Samurai, which gives us better flexibility. If anything, we’re ahead there. So in that position in the schedule would allow for flexibility in my view, based on what I know today is the way I feel about, Brian.
Brian Singer: Great. Thank you.
Roger Jenkins: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Gail Nicholson at Stephens. Please go ahead.
Roger Jenkins: Good morning, Gail.
Gail Nicholson: Good morning, Roger. I was curious on the farm-in opportunities, I feel like people don’t fully appreciate your track record and the interest that you guys gardener in that. Can you just talk about how that farm-in opportunities have changed over time and what you kind of see potentially in the future there.
Roger Jenkins: Well, there are not many operators in the Gulf at our size and nimbleness, if you will. And then we’ve been in the Gulf for a long time. We’re top four operator on gross operating production in the Gulf, well-known. All of our executive team primarily worked super majors before we have relationships with super majors. We’ve respected in that way. And there’s a lot of opportunity. In this idea about leasing and leasing could be delayed or no future leasing that we have 54 exploration blocks, so can you imagine how many BP shale and Chevron have. And going forward, there’s been no mention of stopping that at this point could be, but it hasn’t been that way. We’ve been able to look at all kinds of things in the Gulf going forward, the way the regulation and executive order is at this time. The issue with some of these things, it’s a very nice thing. It is a rank opportunity in a new play, but all my friends really don’t like me to talk about it too much. So the more, the better and better things I do, my operator friends don’tlike me to speak about it. So I’m caught up in that a little bit, and I’m not going to blow that, because I want to keep those relationships and continue to form into these very unique company, making opportunities such as Silverback, such as Sergipe-Alagoas and other places where we work. So sometimes that slide wouldn’t show what exactly we’d like to say, but that’s the business ran that’s okay. And we get along with a well and there’s a mutual respect by super majors with our company. We’re proud of it.
Gail Nicholson: Great. And then just looking at the Montney, you guys have a very impressive all in cost up there about $1.44 per MCFD. I was just kind of curious as you moved into a more steady state development program. Do you think that there’s room for incremental costs improvement overtime?
Roger Jenkins: I’ll let Eric, answer that for you, Gail.
Eric Hambly: We have a significant percentage of our operating costs that are not variable with production rate. So as we fill the gas plant, as Roger mentioned, we’ll get up to about 500 million cubic feet at peak in that project. We’ll see the per barrel or per MCF costs go down. So I would model the cost to be in terms of dollars per year, nearly flat, maybe slight increase with a little bit more cost for new wells, but very minor.
Gail Nicholson: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng at Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.
Roger Jenkins: Good morning, paul.
Paul Cheng: Hey guys, good morning. Roger, that – just curious that in your budget, I suppose that you have a range of oil price you feel here. Can you share with us what’s that? And how the program may change based on the changes in oil prices, oil price is much higher than that range, or you are pretty much fixed to that and say, okay, if the higher oil plants that just go into January more free cash flow. So how should we look at that program?
Roger Jenkins: We don’t usually disclose our pricing. We have here a base price that’s over the next four to five years, I’d describe as at best mid-40s starting low-to-mid. We have a recovery case that reaches into the 50s in two, three years, mid-50s never more than that. It is our plan today to not increase this CapEx and to have the higher oil prices deliver more cash flow to our company balance sheet, to be used as we see fit to reduce debt at the appropriate and proper time. So no discussions here on a different capital plan on anything like that today, Paul going on here at Murphy.
Paul Cheng: Perfect. And for Montney is we need a great economic, so why now your pen is get to 500, but you do have a lot of inventory. So if there any plan or any opportunity that you expend that beyond that. Have you talked to the gas pen operator and see whether that is going to see more infrastructure being built?
Roger Jenkins: We have a unique agreement when we sold this business for this – for that provider of the midstream work to build plants at a fixed price or a way of negotiating a price, which we considered the well-positioned. We did that here and there’s ample area to do it. It can be – it can continue to go in $250 million increments, as much as we want there. Right now we’re going through a 2024, 2025 period of keeping it $500 million in our current plan and then reevaluate if we want to go more, but we certainly can. And I wouldn’t see us increasing it in this plan, because again of all the talk this morning about trying to keep our plan like it is and make more free cash flow. The real unique thing about Montney that may not be understood is our – is that infrastructures in place. It’s been very successful this plant from an uptown perspective. And they built a twin to it, if you will next door. And all the infrastructure, roads, ponds did a very well on water capture here, water recycling. This is in place. We’re drilling right in the middle of where we’ve already built infrastructure. It’s extremely capital-efficient here and a very unique, but we needed – we were doing really well on all our work, but the price just changed. The diff just changed, everything changed, and we see that you have to make the move. And we had a great plant and a great midstream operator. It’s going extremely well. We moved on and went ahead.
Paul Cheng: Roger, how does that process work in terms of the – let’s say who makes the decision going to expand the plant, is a midstream operator, or that you guys make a request and then sign a contract with them, they will increase it, or that you’re solely from kind of from there.
Roger Jenkins: We’ll have to mutually agree on the next one to work and we will. And I can’t imagine why they wouldn’t want to continue, because there are subsets as well and that we’re a nice capital of company for them to be partners with.
Paul Cheng: Two final quick question, first, that’s for the two December unplanned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, is that fully fixed the problem. And what is the subsets – in the first quarter.
Roger Jenkins: Both in the field working on the problems today or this week and the impact of that it’s already in our guidance as to when we think the wealth will come back on. And do you know the impact Eric?
Eric Hambly: Middle of the quarter.
Roger Jenkins: Middle of the quarter should be – I’ll be flowing it’s in our guidance.
Paul Cheng: And so we should assume, yes, roughly about 5,000 barrels per day. We’re trying to look at what is the incremental spend that, that the end of second quarter we should assume when it’s coming back.
Roger Jenkins: It’s in the plan. It wouldn’t be that it’s not that much. The first quarter current guidance would not be that magnitude of downtime from these wells probably be about 3000 off top of my head.
Paul Cheng: Okay. And then final would be that, you already have a pretty sizable hedging program for 2021, should we assume you are pretty all set or that you will look for opportunity to increase that further?
Roger Jenkins: In 2021 at this time and 2022, we have done some hedges, which is disclosed in our release and working on options to review that, but not settled in on that now, because feel like we’re well-positioned with our cash, feel that we’re well-positioned on our liquidity and really taking a look at the additional hedging for 2022 at this time and haven’t made a decision yet on that.
Paul Cheng: Okay. Thank you.
Roger Jenkins: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: Thank you.  Next question comes from Josh Silverstein at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Roger Jenkins: Good morning, Josh. How you are doing?
Josh Silverstein: Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys. I’ll just follow-up on the hedges there. You’ve mentioned the $47 number this year to cover the CapEx and the dividend. I’m wondering if that excludes the hedges and those were put in place at $43. And then maybe if you can just give us some trajectory in that longer-term outlook, I imagine the $47, they go higher next year, since then it’s a peak spending, but then where would that go to in the 2023, 2024 time period as the bigger project fell off.
Roger Jenkins: Our number here would include the hedges and all calculations. And the follow on question, I’m sorry. In the future, we have some 2022 hedges as disclosed here today. That’s all we have. And I have no hedging done prior to that. We do like the hedge some of our production. It depends on how much free cash flow and where all goes and where all liquidity is as to that present that we would want to do. Historically have not been that high of a hedger, but reviewing that in great detail. Does that answer your question, Josh?
Josh Silverstein: Yes. Sorry. The second part of it was just the trajectory of where the $47 may go to next year. My guess is maybe it goes up, but then as you go into 2023 and 24, where would that $47 fall towards?
Roger Jenkins: Well, I wish I knew that wouldn’t be here talking to you. So I believe myself there’s not a lot of liquidity we’re in backwardation now severely. We have seen periods of time. Before COVID where the backwardation just continues to move to the right and the curve looks the same. We’re – like I said earlier today, we have a base price of low-40s to mid-40s over a 2020 to 2025 period in our mind. We’re able to cover our dividend and all these big projects during that period cumulatively, very happy about that. And we’re able to handle that without a difficult, because we have a lot of projects in next couple of years. So that today, as Brian asked the question earlier is no exploration CapEx today. So we should be well-positioned to handle whatever that will be. I do believe we’ll get into the low-50s personally, or to mid-50s after vaccines in COVID and rebound of demand, but there’s a long way to go about that. That’s what I believe personally, but that doesn’t mean that we’re planning to have to have that or anything like that.
Josh Silverstein: Okay. Yes. I’ll follow-up on that. And can you just talk about the Eagle Ford program as well. It’s heavily operated in the first half, and then you’re kind of reliant on non-operated activity in the back half of this year. Was this the basically helped kind of stand the decline from not having any much activity in 2020? And I’m just curious how the volumes are being rested in the back half given the shift from operators in non-op.
Eric Hambly: Yes, you’re right about our operative program. We have 19 wells to come online in the year, 16 in the first quarter, three in the second quarter. And then our non-operated program is second and third quarter weighted. The non-operated program that we’re participating in is a quite a large number for us. It works out to be the equivalent kind of working interest basis of about 10 wells. So those are material for us relative to our historical non-op contribution. The programs are all well underway and I don’t expect any kind of timing issues or uncertainty around the timing of delivery for the non-operated, because we were working closely with the operators. We know what they’re doing. They’re executing quite well.
Roger Jenkins: Yes. The significant non-op positions of BPX. We have an incredible team. We visited with them in detail last year. They purchased this asset for a lot of money. They’re very serious about developing and we feel pretty good about that non-op right now, Josh.
Eric Hambly: What’s somewhat unique about the program is quite a few of the non-operated wells that will come online this year have already been drilled. So they’re mostly completion activities in 2021. And production expectation for Eagle Ford is flat about 30,000 barrels a day.
Josh Silverstein: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks guys.
Roger Jenkins: All right, Josh. Thank you. I believe that’s your last question at this time. Is there one more? Okay. Everyone, we’re going to return back to work here. We appreciate everyone calling in and it will be seeing our next quarterly result. Appreciate all your questions and help and thanks for calling in. Appreciate it, bye
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and we ask that you please disconnect your lines."
