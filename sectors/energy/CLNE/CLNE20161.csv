"Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Clean Energy Fuels first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Kritzer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tony Kritzer: Thank you, operator. Earlier this afternoon, Clean Energy released financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2016. If you do not receive the release, it is available on the Investor Relations section of the company's Web site at www.cleanenergyfuels.com where the call is also being webcast. There will be a replay available on the Web site for 30 days. Before we begin, we’d like to remind you that some of the information contained in the news release and on this conference call contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Words of expression reflecting optimism, satisfaction with current prospects, as well as words such as believe, intend, expect, plan, should, anticipate and similar variations identify forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of performance and the company's actual results could differ materially from those contained in such statements. Several factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are described in detail in the Risk Factors section of the Clean Energy’s Form 10-Q filed May 5, 2016. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements or supply new information regarding the circumstances after the date of this release. The company’s non-GAAP EPS and adjusted EBITDA will be reviewed on this call and exclude certain expenses that the company's management does not believe are indicative of the company's core operating business results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. The directly comparable GAAP information, reasons why management uses non-GAAP information, a definition of non-GAAP EPS and adjusted EBITDA, and a reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP figures is provided in the company's press release, which has been furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K today. Participating on today's call from the company is President and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Littlefair, and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Vreeland. And with that, I will turn the call over to Andrew.
Andrew Littlefair: Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I’m going to keep my remarks focused on the most important takeaways from what we feel was a strong first quarter. We reported first quarter revenue of $95.8 million, which is a 12% increase over the first quarter of last year. Additionally, we reported $29.8 million of adjusted EBITDA versus negative $5.6 million in Q1 of 2015. The first quarter of 2016 included $6.4 million of VETC and a gain of $15.9 million from buying back some of our converts at a discount. However, even when these real benefits are backed out, our adjusted EBITDA was still positive at $7.5 million, an improvement of over $13 million from the first quarter of 2015. We delivered 77.5 million gallons to our customers. This is a 3% increase over the 75 million gallons we delivered during the first quarter of 2015. On the year-end earnings call, I told you that a primary focus for 2016 would be to conserve cash and de-leverage the balance sheet. To that end, we repaid $60 million of the $145 million convertible notes due in August 2016. In addition, given favorable pricing, we have been opportunistically repurchasing our 2018 convertible debt in the open market through privately negotiated transactions. In the first quarter, we repurchased $32.5 million; and so far in the second quarter, we have repurchased an additional $31.5 million. All told, we have repurchased $64 million of our 2018 convertible notes, leaving $186 million due in October 2018. Our total convertible debt reduction is $124 million. Also to date, in 2016, we have raised $32.4 million of proceeds from public stock sales. At quarter-end, we had $163 million of cash and investments on our balance sheet. Additionally, we reduced our SG&A by 15% year-over-year, while growing our volume and revenues. We are on track with our reduced CapEx budget of $25 million for 2016, which is 50% less than last year, so we are executing on our plan to conserve cash and reduce our debt. From an industry perspective, the pressure for companies to become more sustainable continues to grow. We see natural gas fueling as an economic and realistic solution that a company can utilize to achieve greater sustainability. And we are working with a variety of fleets and shippers like Kroger and Unilever as well as trucking companies, waste companies and municipalities. Fleets continue to look to fuel with natural gas. Here is a noteworthy example. The United States Postal Service is pursuing an initiative to reduce their carbon footprint by 20% by 2020 and have concluded that natural gas is the alternative fuel of choice for their third-party contracted carriers. These carrier carriers are responsible for the majority of all USPS transportation emissions. As part of their contract renewals, the Postal Service is starting to require its outside carriers to use natural gas where it is cost-effective. We are currently working with five other major carriers, who combined have 75 natural gas tractors fueling at several of our highway stations. Additionally, the USPS is considering replacing some of their own Class A tractors and straight trucks with natural gas. Turning now to our renewable fuel business, we continue to see increased interest in demand for our renewable fuel offering. Through our robust network of stations, we have established a pathway to Redeem, our renewable green gas, into vehicles. This is the best way to realize the full value of renewable fuel, which contributed $11 million of revenue in the first quarter. I want to emphasize that our expanding infrastructure has enabled us to benefit from this rapidly growing renewable market and differentiates us from our competitors. Companies like UPS, Ryder, Republic Services and many transit agencies use Redeem and understand its significance. Another important industry innovation, the Cummins Westport low NOx engine has already captured a lot of interest, and these engines are available to order. As a reminder, this low NOx engine reduces NOx 90%. And when combined with our Redeem renewable fuel, it has 90% less carbon. It is cleaner than running an electric vehicle that is plugged into the grid. In the industry, this new introduction is referred to as game changer. Turning now to our station construction, we benefited, during the first quarter, from an increase in full station projects. Currently, we have over 60 projects under contract and in the pipeline. We continue to believe our robust construction pipeline is a solid indicator that our customers continue to make investments in expanding their fleets and remain committed to their sustainability goals. Our virtual pipeline subsidiary, NG Advantage, showed impressive growth, delivering close to 8.6 million gallons to their customers. I'm also pleased to report that we recently signed a follow-on supply deal with Hawaii Gas, which is contracted to purchase over 14 million LNG gallons over the next five years. All told, it was a strong quarter. And I believe it is a testament to our diverse product offering and recurring revenue base. Our largest customers continue to buy new trucks and invest in their natural gas operation and we continue to gain new customers across our markets of transit, refuse and trucking. Our adjusted EBITDA continues to trend positively and we are taking strategic actions to de-leverage our balance sheet and we’re being disciplined with our capital. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Vreeland: Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon to everyone. As Andrew mentioned, we have a strong quarter with continued volume growth, a 12% increase in revenue, and adjusted EBITDA of $29.8 million. Starting with volume of 77.5 million gallons, a 3% growth rate over the first quarter of 2015, impacting this growth rate was a decline in RNG volume of 3.5 million gallons. Most of that decline is the result of no longer owning and operating our former Dallas bio-methane plant, which we sold and then operated through mid-April of 2015. Exclusive of those gallons, our volume growth was 8% year-over-year. As Andrew mentioned, NG Advantage had strong year-over-year growth as did our refuse sector, while the other sectors were level with a year ago. LNG volume was down 2.9 million gallons, principally from lower bulk LNG sales. Bulk LNG sales can be uneven throughout the year as LNG demand is influenced by various external factors, such as, more recently, the slowdown in E&P industry, the variable demand of large industrial customers, and weather. We remain active and compete well in the bulk LNG marketplace as evidenced by our new deal with Hawaii Gas. Our Redeem gallons, which are included in our CNG and LNG fuel gallons, increased 70% year-over-year to 15.2 million gallons for the quarter. Our 12% increase in revenue in the first quarter was driven by a better effective price per gallon on higher volume, increased construction project revenue, and the alternative fuel tax credit referred to as VETC. Our Compression sales were down year-over-year as we remain in this challenging global oil environment together with a strong US dollar, although the related gross margin contribution from our Compression business was better than a year ago despite the lower revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA of $29.8 million was driven by a strong gross profit margin, continued reductions in SG&A spending, and a gain from our opportunistic convertible debt repurchase. Our strong gross profit margin was driven substantially by the impacts of selling our Redeem fuel and the associated environmental credits, which helped take our gross profit margin per gasoline gallon equivalent to $0.36 per gallon compared to $0.28 for the first quarter of 2015. Both quarters include the state and federal environmental credits, the LCFS and RINs. The combined credits amounted to $11 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $3.2 million in 2015. The economic benefits from the environmental attributes of both natural gas and Redeem remain strong and have more than offset the pressure on retail fuel margins from this low oil and diesel price environment. And finally, on gross margin, we benefited from our increased station construction project sales and the VETC revenue. Our 15% reduction in SG&A to $25.6 million was $4.6 million lower than a year ago and $1 million or 4% lower than the recent fourth quarter. This has been a continuing trend and is the result of the actions we’ve taken given the low oil price environment. And as Andrew mentioned, we recorded a $15.9 million gain on the repurchase of $32.5 million of our 2018 convertible debt. The higher revenues and gross profit margin and lower SG&A, along with the gain on debt repurchase, led to GAAP net income of $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $31 million a year ago. And it also lead to an improvement of $35.4 million in adjusted EBITDA from a year ago. Looking forward, we anticipate our Redeem sales to benefit our results, VETC will be recorded each quarter in 2016 relative to volume, and we continue to expect positive quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the balance of 2016. And with that, operator, we’ll open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Nice quarter.
Andrew Littlefair: Thank you, Eric.
Robert Vreeland: Thanks, Eric.
Eric Stine: I want to start with Redeem, especially given the impact that had in this quarter. How do you think about that long-term – limiting factors to growing volumes there? I know part of it is that, right now, what, California and Oregon that have LCFS, have the standards where you can participate. But do you see other states going down the road of California? And ultimately, where do you think that those Redeem volumes can go?
Andrew Littlefair: Thanks. I think the short answer, Eric, is the – we’ve had tremendous growth in the Redeem business, and so it won't be easy to keep up on that growth. But it will continue to develop, and so I think you should count on what we’re doing. So what you saw in the first quarter should continue. I really think that in terms of renewable fuel, we’re really at a beginning point as we've got a few different – I know you attended the ACT Conference out here. I really believe that the transportation industry, passenger car, and also those in goods movement, I think this being sustainable fuels and sustainable technologies, I think we’re just at the beginning of what’s going to be a very long move toward cleaner fuels and cleaner innovation, cleaner technology. So I think, over time, you'll see us continue to grow Redeem. Washington State is now looking at Low Carbon Fuel Standards. We’re selling Redeem in Texas now. The Northeast has kind of come in and out of something that feels a little bit like Low Carbon Fuel Standards. Some states will be more progressive than others. But I think you're going to continue over time to see more and more regulations that incent and begin to put more values on carbon. And so, I think the good news is for our industry and for our company is that we have this renewable fuel, we have the network to be able to dispense it and the pathway to be able to get it into vehicles. That gives us a huge leg up compared to some of the others in this business. And I think that having the technology, the new Cummins Westport engine which I know was highlighted at this big conference out here just this week, it’s a low NOx engine which is very important for tailpipe emissions, but it also – when it's combined, as I said in my remarks, with Redeem, it's really cleaner than the grid which is a big deal. So I think we are well-positioned and I think it will be important, Eric, as we go forward.
Eric Stine: That’s volumes. But in terms of pricing, what I'm looking at or reading, it seems like the thought is that the pricing, the carbon price per ton, that trend, while there may be some near-term volatility, the trend there is higher too.
Andrew Littlefair: Yes, Eric. And that's right. So there's two – there's definitely two components to that. There’s the volume and then there's the pricing of the environmental credits. And that environment has been strong and continues to be strong at the moment. Now, like you said, there’s always the chance of some volatility. But just the way – with the standards that have been set and the obligated parties and all of that, it’s making that kind of a strong market.
Eric Stine: Yeah, okay. Maybe just thinking about your fleet activity, yesterday, at ACT, clear impression that people thinking that the market is probably flat this year, maybe down a little bit, but just curious, are you seeing any movement in your pipelining other than maybe the timing getting pushed out a little bit? Have any fleets dropped out of that pipeline? What are you seeing right now?
Andrew Littlefair: Eric, when you look at our customer base, the refuse market continues to be strong. It'll be as big a year as we’ve had. And we’ve been a host of an industry event, which is called the Garbageman's Invitational. It’s worth 300 refuse industry executives come here a couple weeks ago. And to a company, they’re all fueling natural gas trucks. And so, that’s a really important segment for us. We see the same thing expanding in transit. Now, when we talk about kind of flat year-over-year, the trucking industry hasn't been as involved. It doesn't have quite the maturity in terms of putting vehicles in their fleet like the refuse and transit guys who have been at this now for a decade. So it was a newer segment for us. And I would say, Eric, those that – we’re still seeing new fleets come, often in more of a testing mode with handfuls or dozens of vehicles rather than large purchases. But even in that segment, which I think you're correct, that it will be similar this year to what it was last year, which I would consider to be important that we’re not backsliding. UPS continues to show the way as other big fleets like them. They haven't turned back and we haven't really seen any existing customers that have been in this, especially in the trucking, go back. Those that were on the fence when we entered this downturn in the oil price, they continue to review it. But I would say their attitude – and I’ve even probably met some out there at the conference. The attitude is not opposed to natural gas. In fact, I find it refreshing, in that they're interested in moving forward. But they’re mindful of the fact that they've gotten very low diesel price right now. So I think that when that subsides you’re going to see an uptick in the adoption of natural gas for heavy duty trucking.
Eric Stine: Right. I guess this is kind of tough to quantify, but I’ll ask anyways. Is there an oil price that you look at and say, okay, at that level, then that’s when trucking really pick back up again?
Andrew Littlefair: It's hard to pin me down there. But I know this is that, we've had some customers begin to model out oil at $40 a barrel, right? And in some cases, that sort of is difficult to make the natural gas equation work as well as it once did. I think, Eric, when you see $50, $55, $60 a barrel, it really gets – it really begins to move up the price of diesel. Look, diesel price has gone up nationally $0.10 in the last two weeks. It’s gone up every week for the last four weeks. And so, we don’t need to see $100 oil. You need to see the price of – we need to get off of people thinking that we’re going to have $40 oil forever. And I think once they see that there’s volatility, again, in their oil price and it comes back up to $50, $55, $60, I think that’s going to be the signal to have people begin to then – natural gas is still – let’s not forget, that’s our big commodity that we use here and it’s low. It's very low. And so, the economics begin to sing again when you get back up to that oil price.
Eric Stine: Okay, thanks a lot. That’s it for me.
Andrew Littlefair: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Andrew Littlefair: Hi, Rob. Good afternoon.
Rob Brown: Congratulations on the EBITDA improvement. I think you said you had 60 stations in your pipeline. Could you give us a sense of – is that all to be delivered this year? And then maybe a sense of the gallon volume that those projects sort of generate ongoing?
Andrew Littlefair: I don’t know that I have the volume for you, Rob. But most of those stations that we’re talking about in the pipeline will be delivered this year.
Rob Brown: And then the mix of those, is it refuse mostly or maybe what is the mix there?
Andrew Littlefair: Big piece of those, refuse that are under contract, some are for our own account, some are for long contracted volumes from anchored tenants for stations that we’re building. Majority of those, though, are for customers – that we’re selling customers. And I hedged just a bit when we use the number over 60 and stuff like that because we get toward the end of the year and some of these – they will be under construction. But you never know if you’re going to get them all – four or five of them, we got it in December and this and that. But it looks to me like the station count should be very similar this year as it was last year, which are some of our biggest years that we’ve had.
Rob Brown: Okay, great. And then the Hawaiian Gas contract, I assume you’re supplying that out of Boron, but could you give us a sense of, again, what the gallon volume is there and sort of how that works?
Andrew Littlefair: Well, it starts out slow. And then my friends at Hawaii Gas have been – they’ve been wanting us to be careful about how much we’re saying. But it starts out – as you know, Rob, we've sold them some LNG already really more of in a test mode. And we had pieces of this contract done, gosh, maybe as long as a year ago and we were awaiting PUC approval, which came here a little bit ago. They’re now in the process of beginning to go out to bid to receive the containers that will be used for that shipping. Those will be – that's underway now. Those containers will be delivered throughout this year and I imagine a big slug of those in the back end of this year. So we’ll begin to ramp up. And I think it begins to amount to around 3 million, 3.5 million gallons a year. And there’s a chance we’d do better than that. But it's a nice additional load. And I hope the experience will be well because even with – you can imagine, all this entailed, we’re still able to bring them a very clean fuel that beats the otherwise imported fuel that they use for the islands. So we’re excited about it. They're excited about it. And I hope that we can increase that from the number that I gave you in my remarks.
Rob Brown: Great, thank you. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Your next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question, guys. One of the things that's really helped you get into positive EBITDA is the reduction in SG&A. So you went from $30 million a year ago to $26 million this quarter. Is there any further room to cut that even more?
Robert Vreeland: Yes, there is room. And so, we've been feeling the effects of actions that we’ve taken as we’ve been going along. So it's been kind of coming down each quarter. Certainly, on a year-over-year basis, it's a bigger number. As we go sequentially, it’s coming down. But at some point, it'll flatten a little bit.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, pretty close to where we are right now?
Andrew Littlefair: I think, Pavel, there's a little room still left in it. We’re continuing to eye different things to try to bring it down some more. I think there’s still some room left. You’ll see it maybe improve, continue this year. But all the while we’re still growing. And so, there'll be a limit to how low we can bring it.
Robert Vreeland: Yeah. So it’s pretty close.
Pavel Molchanov: Just a housekeeping question, in Q1, you got the VETC catchup cash inflow, how much was that?
Robert Vreeland: Correct. So we collected all of the VETC that related to 2015.
Pavel Molchanov: How much is that?
Robert Vreeland: Yeah, so it was a little bit in excess of about $30 million.
Pavel Molchanov: $30 million. Thank you, guys.
Robert Vreeland: Yeah. North of that. Little bit north of that.
Andrew Littlefair: $32 million.
Robert Vreeland: Yeah. So it’s a little bit…
Andrew Littlefair: $32 million, yeah.
Robert Vreeland: Exactly.
Andrew Littlefair: Thanks, Pavel.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I’d now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Littlefair for closing remarks.
Andrew Littlefair: Good. Well, thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone. I want to thank you for listening and – listening in on the call this afternoon. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines."
