All participants on this call will be in a listen-only mode. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Weiss, our CEO.
Mike Weiss: Great, thank you, Jenna, and thanks everyone for joining us today. During the first half of 2021, we hope that our long-term goals and vision for TG -- TG have really come into focus for investors. Our first phase of our multi-phase strategy now complete with the accelerated approval of the UKONIQ, the first and only dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and CK1-epsilon for the treatment of relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.
Adam Waldman: Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I'm very excited to provide a commercial update for the first full quarter of the UKONIQ launch. Let me start with some numbers and then provide some qualitative assessment. As you've already seen in the financial press release, we achieved $1.5 million in net sales in UKONIQ for the second quarter, which was our first full quarter of sales. While we were quite pleased with the extent of our launch penetration, which by our estimates, reflects UKONIQ capturing 3% to 4% of new patient starts in our labeled indication. In our view, that is a great starting point that is ahead of our internal projections.
Sean Power: Thank you, Adam. And thanks everyone again for joining us. Earlier this morning, we reported our detailed second quarter 2021 financial results, which can be viewed on the Investors and Media section of our corporate website. For today's call, I'll keep my remarks brief and touch on a few highlights from the quarter, beginning with our cash position. We ended the second quarter with approximately $456 million in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, which we believe will be sufficient to take us into 2023. As Adam noted earlier, we are pleased to report $1.5 million of UKONIQ net product revenue in the second quarter, our first full quarter of product sales. Our net loss for the second quarter of 2021, excluding non-cash items was approximately $62 million, which was a decrease of $12 million quarter-over-quarter from Q1 of 2021 where we saw a net loss, excluding non-cash items of approximately $74 million. Given that Q1 of this year was our first quarter as fully commercial entity, it's probably a more apples-to-apples comparison to what we saw this quarter. As compared to the first quarter of 2021, the decrease of approximately $12 million was primarily driven by one-time licensing milestone payments of approximately $14 million recurring in Q1 of this year. If we shift and compare this quarter to Q2 of 2020 where we saw a net loss, excluding non-cash items of approximately $46 million, that increase is primarily related to increased selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the launch of UKONIQ and planning for the potential future launches of U2 in CLL and ublituximab in RMS. Our GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2021 inclusive of non-cash items was $78.5 million or $0.59 per share compared to a net loss of $52.9 million or $0.47 per share during the comparable quarter in 2020. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the conference operator to begin the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.  And our first question is from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Alethia Young: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the early progress with the launch. Maybe just a couple from me. One, just I wanted to get a bit more color about how you were talking about during the COVID trends, just how much penetration have occurred into the roughly around I guess 3,000 heme onco  and kind of how has that kind of ebbed and flowed like -- it sounded like it might start to slow a little bit in light of the Delta variant? And then, my second question is just as far as a differentiated clinical profile like an MZL and follicular, especially on the safety, I just wanted to get some color around how that's going and some of the early experience. I know it's still super early, but just any kind of color you can provide there. And then I was intrigued by kind of the -- when you said the 2025 $1 billion in sales, like, can you give us a little bit framework about how to think about what that breakout might be between like multiple sclerosis and the hematology indications? Thanks.
Mike Weiss: Yes, sure. Do you want me take those? Hello?
Adam Waldman: I'm sorry. Yes, please. I was on mute.
Mike Weiss: Okay.
Adam Waldman: Hey Alethia, thank you. Doing this in the -- over the lines, it's a little tough. So sorry. So the first question around penetration, we are -- I think given the pandemic, we're -- and as I've mentioned before, we've hired a really experienced team, they came in here with relationships and existing connections. So our penetration has been very good especially in the top centers. The issue is with -- just with frequency and just how often you can get into these centers and with a new product, it does take multiple visits sometimes to discuss the full profile, the mechanism, the patient populations and it does take some time with -- so to answer your question, penetration been good, especially into the top accounts. We're working on frequency. We're starting to see that, and as I mentioned, things did get modestly better in the second quarter. We were seeing increases in live engagements, which we think is a more effective way of communicating. However, with the Delta variant in the last few weeks, we are seeing reversal of those trends. And so it's getting -- we're starting to see -- cancer centers start to restrict live engagements again. So we'll have to watch that and see how it goes. But in general, we feel like live engagements are better. Our penetration has been good, but obviously it's a fluid situation. Alethia, can you remind me of the second question?
Alethia Young: Feedback on like kind of the use as far as the safety differentiation that could be seen with UKONIQs.
Adam Waldman: Yes. I mean, the feedback has been really positive on the profile. They see it as very differentiated. As I mentioned before, the lack of a black box warning is seen as differentiating versus the other PI3Ks out there. And I think it just takes time for when they see a patient and when a patient presents himself, and these patients don't show up on an individual physician basis that often throughout the year. So when we're able to get good frequency of interaction a patient shows up, that's when we're getting use. But the feedback on the product has been very, very positive. And then, as far as the breakdown in the $1 billion, as I mentioned, we expect a small contribution from MS given that we are expecting a late in the year approval there. We expect to get some contribution from U2 given that we would have three quarters of use of approval. And our ability to promote U2 and CLL starting in the second quarter is our expectation. And then the continued launch of marginal zone and follicular will continue to form the base of the revenue projections.
Mike Weiss: Alethia, just to clarify, Adam was referring to 2022 in his answer.
Alethia Young: 2022, got it.
Mike Weiss: That was for 2022. For the $1 billion in 2025, I don't think we've gone as far as to say that, but I think at that point, we should be in a 50-50 or trending toward larger contribution from MS at that point.
Alethia Young: Okay.
Mike Weiss: Because the models that we have in forecast are, there is some flux between bull and bear cases. And so I think we're giving ourselves a little bit of flexibility there as well.
Alethia Young: Okay, cool. I guess just a follow-up. Just -- you talked about these 8,000 follicular and MZL which I mean could be a sizable opportunity itself. So I guess, I was just trying to get a feel between '22 and '25, how confident you are in being able to kind of penetrate this core group over time?
Mike Weiss: Yes. I mean, I think in terms of marginal zone and follicular, we feel pretty good about the potential for penetration. Again, I don't know what peak penetration expectations are overall. But I mean, I think if we were 20% to 30% penetration that would be pretty fantastic in any group where there is multiple drugs available.
Alethia Young: Awesome. Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.
Josh Schimmer: Thanks so much for taking the questions. First, on reimbursement and access. How do you expect to evolve from here for UKONIQ or for U2, the reasons to expect it will improve? And if so, what would those reasons be? Second, if you could discuss the pathway for full approval of UKONIQ, and what you expect will take to achieve that? And then last, maybe you could talk or even consider kind of rank ordering the obstacles to UKONIQ adoption, how much of it is COVID, how much is reimbursement, how much of it is awareness, how much is competitive therapies? And how you think those obstacles may alleviate in the coming months and years? Thank you.
Mike Weiss: Yes, Adam, why don't you go ahead with some reimbursement access and where you see things heading?
Adam Waldman: Sure. Yes, thanks for the question, Josh. On the access and reimbursement front, we really haven't seen many challenges. I think as I mentioned, we have achieved broad coverage, the broad payer coverage and they are not experiencing any issues with regards to that. I think what you may be getting to whether we can clarify, but that's -- I think we're good on the access and reimbursement side. I'll take the obstacles and competitive question, and I'll let you Mike talk about the full approval. I think the obstacles -- yes, I mean, as Mike mentioned in his remarks, launching in a pandemic is difficult. When we get in front of physicians, as I mentioned there, they have a very positive feedback on the product, but that's when we get in front of them and we're continuing to make progress there. And when we have those interactions, they are largely very positive interactions, and from our market research, it shows that they see it as a differentiated product and one in which is very compelling for marginal zone and follicular patients in our indications. There is -- I think the obstacles are the COVID in just getting access. I think there is some decrease in patient visits or patient treatment starts just given the reticence of some patients, as I mentioned, coming in to start a new treatment and I think those will be the biggest challenges. And I think they will hopefully alleviate when we get further down the line and get away from the pandemic going forward.
Mike Weiss: And Josh on the pathway for full approval of UKONIQ, so I guess, two points: one, the CLL, UNITY CLL trial will ideally support a full approval of the UKONIQ in CLL; and then converting the marginal zone and follicular accelerated approval into a full approval will require a randomized trial that we're in the process of finalizing the design with the FDA, and hopefully that study will commence before year end. The concept there will be some trial that will be in slightly earlier lines of follicular and then randomized trial with UKONIQ.
Josh Schimmer: Adam, maybe you can kind of clarify on the reimbursement, the 35% free drug whether that's something you expect to continue or whether that may improve going forward? And if so, why?
Adam Waldman: Yes. I got you. Okay. Yes, good to clarify. So yes, I mean, in marginal zone and follicular, specifically, we're seeing a general lack of co-pay support funds available for Medicare Part D patients. A large part of the -- a large percentage of our patients in this specific indication are Medicare Part D over the age of 65. And specifically in marginal zone and follicular, we are not seeing availability of co-pay funds. We do expect that, that would change with CLL. We see much more funding available on CLL and this is much less of an issue with CLL. And then MS is a different ball game altogether. We're talking about largely commercial patients, so not as relevant. But -- so we would expect this to persist for this year. And then as we get into CLL, we would expect it to come down as an overall issue given the funding that's available in that patient population.
Josh Schimmer: Thanks very much.
Mike Weiss: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Eric Joseph with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Joseph: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I think the first is around your 2022 sales guidance. I'm just wondering what that anticipates in terms of CLL penetration and whether there is any anticipated impact to UKONIQ net price as combo therapy as opposed to use as single-agent in follicular and marginal zone. And then I'd also be curious to get a sense of what your latest thinking is around the European or EU commercial and regulatory strategies across the different franchises, both in hemo ublituximab  in RMS? Thanks.
Mike Weiss: Thanks, Eric. Adam, do you want to take a crack? Let me take crack at the first one.
Adam Waldman: Yes. Why don't you start and then I'll weigh in.
Mike Weiss: Yes. So in terms of CLL, in terms of penetration, I think we're assuming given the point in time of the year that we'll get launched, which will be probably into the second quarter, that there'll be obviously some contribution from CLL in the year. In terms of the amount of penetration, I think we're even -- using even more modest penetration numbers than we found than what we're seeing right now with UKONIQ in MZL and follicular. And so we've been pretty conservative in those assessments. And then in terms of the UKONIQ pricing as part of the package, yes, we have not finalized pricing yet. So it's hard for us to give too much detail because, again, I don't think anyone knows what the -- we haven't given any guidance on the ublituximab pricing. But the most likely will be some discounting to UKONIQ in that setting, but it's really -- it will become a function of what we price, where we price ublituximab and to come together to basically come up with a total price that we think is fair for the patient population.
Eric Joseph: Got it. Second, sort of latest opinion on approaching the European commercial opportunity  perhaps with the various product franchises?
Mike Weiss: Yes. So we're in the process of scoping that out still. We're moving forward with -- I think we're working towards -- I think the first application don't -- yes, I think I got to go back and check with the regulatory team. But the first application in Europe may be in MS. So we may actually end up staging it MS first and then CLL second there. But I think I need to probably get back to you on that. But we are definitely just moving forward. We think that the MS opportunity in Europe is a very interesting one for us and one that's managed probably more cleanly with a smaller team, certainly than we acquired in the US and that pricing in Europe will be a big driver of uptake. So we're still exploring that to make sure that those assumptions are valid. But assuming that's the case, we think there's a pretty interesting opportunity for European launch in MS, while we're still continuing to scope out how that pricing interplay with CLL will occur. So I think for the moment, I'm pretty sure we're going to head forward with MS first and then CLL second ex US.
Eric Joseph: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it.
Mike Weiss: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Chris Howerton with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Howerton: Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Congratulations on the progress.
Mike Weiss: Thanks, Chris.
Chris Howerton: I think for me -- of course. First, with respect to the U2 plus the venetoclax trials, I guess, I couldn't quite remember what the regulatory path is. Would the Phase 2 study be sufficient for an accelerated approval opportunity? I guess, is just a pretty simple question. And then with respect to the Phase 2 study itself, what would be the expected data disclosure? I know there was at least in my head, some anticipation that we would get the -- some of the data at ASH, but it might not be the full results. So I guess, some thinking around that would be helpful. And then the last question was just ensuring that everything is good to go with respect to CMC, particularly as it relates to ublituximab? Thank you.
Mike Weiss: Sure. So in terms of the U2-VEN program, we've been focused on three -- almost three full phases, right? So we had a Phase 1 that Dr. Paul Barr conducted as a lead investigator, and that Phase 1 is where we -- is what we've presented previously at last year's ASH, and it's what we've been committing to present later this year and update too. So I think we had 27 patients through 12 months in the first go around, and we're looking for somewhere between 40 and 50 patients through 12 months for the completion of the patients in that trial. So that is the U2-VEN data that we've been talking about as being presented later this year. In terms of ULTRA-V, as we've said, the enrollment completed early in -- earlier this year into the Phase 2 portion. And so that data to have all the patients through 12 months would not occur until after -- well after ASH. And in fact, we would need to be prepared for ASH, probably two months prior data. So the ULTRA-V data set, as I've noted multiple times, will be incomplete for this ASH. And if we could present a partial data set or not was really a function of what the principal investigator wanted to do. And so we're still trying to figure that out today whether we'll do a partial data set. But my general feeling is that it probably will not occur this year. And I've said this in multiple occasions, if it were me and I was the PI and we were that close to the -- to having all patients through 12 months, I wouldn't want to release a partial set when I could do a full set within a reasonable time frame of that. So we'll wait to hear back from the PI and what his decision is. But I think from where I sit, I wouldn't be surprised at all. And in fact, I'd be surprised if he said he wanted to present the partial data set. We'll see where it goes. But for the moment, the Phase 1 is where we'll see the U2-VEN data later this year, and ULTRA-V is more likely than not going to be a more complete data set next year. And then, in terms of the regulatory side of that question, once we have the full Phase 2 data through the -- at least all the patients through the 12-month time point, we'll look at that data, and we'll have a conversation with the FDA. Ideally, U2 will be approved at that time. So hopefully, it will have an easier pathway from the FDA to approval of U2 already being approved and venetoclax already being approved. But as we've, again said multiple times, there's no assurance that, that Phase 2 data will be usable for approval. If it is not usable for approval, of course, the Phase 2 portion will be published. We'll certainly send it over to NCCN and see if they're interested in adding it to their guidelines. And the Phase 3 is enrolling as we speak. So that's the current status of that program.
Chris Howerton: Great. Okay, that's awesome. And then, I guess just anything to note on CMC?
Mike Weiss: Nothing to note that we filed the CMC, I think it was the first section we filed as part of the rolling submission for ublituximab for the CLL application for ubli. And to my knowledge, there's been a dialogue back and forth. The FDA has been reviewing that file. And it's typical of any filing. There's questions that come in and go back out to the FDA, and that is the process that is ongoing but nothing to the team's great concern as far as I know.
Chris Howerton: Okay, fantastic. Well, thank you, Mike. Appreciate it, and hope to talk to you soon.
Mike Weiss: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Ed White with H. C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your question.
Ed White: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe the first question to Sean, you gave some guidance on SG&A expenses trending higher. I was wondering if you can make any comments on R&D. I know there was the $4 million charge in the quarter. But how should we be thinking about the second half of this year?
Sean Power: Sure. Thanks, Ed. So SG&A trended higher over last year -- over last second quarter, of course, as you'd expect, given the commercial launch. I think, it will continue to tick up a little bit over the course of the rest of this year, as I said, as we prepare the CLL and MS launches. And I wouldn't expect all that much on the R&D front, I would say, not a whole lot of volatility there over the remainder of the year.
Ed White: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, Mike, just some pipeline questions, you had just commented on ULTRA-V Phase 2. Can you give us any update on how the Phase 3 enrollment is going? Are there any trends you can look at now to let us know when you think the trial will be fully enrolled? And then you had mentioned data later in this year for the Phase 1 trial. I'm just wondering for the other combinations and drugs in development, what we could potentially see at ASH this year?
Mike Weiss: Sure. So in terms of full enrollment into ULTRA-V, it's way too early, unfortunately, to give any kind of good projection enrollment when we started about a month or two ago. So it's -- we're in very early days for early stage of a trial. It's going quite well. But obviously, we're going to -- we got to see a big ramp at some point and then have a better sense of what the target enrollment time frame would be for that? In terms of data from the rest of the pipeline for later this year, certainly, we continue to enroll more patients in the TG-1701 study in the BTK. So that one will continue to eke out data at all the conferences, keep people updated on the progress of that program. And then with CD47, CD19 and TG-1501, those are continuing to be in the early stages and we -- again, I cannot promise data this year, as I noted. Potentially later this year, for sure, next year, I mean, we will have certainly something presented by next year, but potential for later this year. So, I think in terms of what to expect during the remainder of this year, the -- of course, the final data from the Phase 1 of U2 plus VEN, we'll see sometime later this year, more up to date -- more updated data on TG-1701 to come out. And I'm sure there's -- I know the team is working on sub-analysis of all the different trials, so there's other things that people are working on. But in terms of data sets that you have visibility at for the moment, I think those are probably the two primary data sets that are remaining. And like I said, some sub-analysis that we'll be coming out with.
Ed White: Okay, thanks, Mike. And then, my final question is; you mentioned when you were talking about MS, other auto inflammatory disease indications and other forms of MS, I was just wondering, how should we be thinking about that potential? Should we be seeing potential study start in next year? Or is this further down the road than that?
Mike Weiss: I mean, I think it's possible to see some studies starting next year. We're working on a few concepts, and if they come to fruition, then yes, I would expect some things to start -- some studies to start next year. We'll keep you posted for sure.
Ed White: Okay. Thanks, Mike.
Mike Weiss: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Graig Suvannavejh with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Graig Suvannavejh: Yes, thanks. Good morning. I've got a couple of questions, if I could. One, just on UKONIQ and it might be too early for you to comment, but can you provide an update on the number of accounts that you've penetrated and if -- and this might certainly be too early, but if you're seeing any reordering? I'm just trying to get a sense of what the ordering pattern dynamic might be for UKONIQ. And then a follow-up on UKONIQ is, it seems as if the way you're positioning the product relative to the portfolio, is that it's a very good product for patients and prescribers to get an overall good experience with TG Therapeutics. And with that in mind, I was wondering if you might be comfortable providing what you currently believe the peak revenue opportunity at UKONIQ might be? And then moving beyond UKONIQ, just looking at the MS landscape, any color that you might be able to provide would be appreciated just on what you're seeing in the anti-CD20 marketplace. Obviously, you've got Ocrevus there and Kesimpta is relatively new, but just wondering if you can comment on just how you're seeing Kesimpta in that launch and how that's having an impact either on Ocrevus alone or just the overall anti-CD20 market in general? Thanks.
Mike Weiss: Sure. Actually, Adam, do you want to start at the last question? We'll work our way backwards through. There's some questions about accounts and reordering on the UKONIQ side, but maybe while that question is fresh, maybe some MS commentary.
Adam Waldman: Yes, sure. Yes, we just saw -- I think Roche and Novartis just had a conference call last week. There was some dialogue around their launch there. So we're looking at that. It looks like there was some recovery from -- earlier in the pandemic, it looks like they are continuing to get some traction in the anti-CD20 space, the class itself is on a growth trend. Kesimpta is getting some traction in the market, but both seem to be holding steady and it's not growing now again as the pandemic continues on here. But -- so we're encouraged by it. I think the physicians that we talk to continue to be very excited about the class, excited about the use of the product earlier and earlier in arresting the disease. So we think it's good trends overall and that the class itself is growing, which we think is very positive. Let me talk about the UKONIQ, I think the first question was around accounts and reordering. As I mentioned, we are seeing -- where we're seeing usage is in our top accounts in the highest volume accounts. The split that we're seeing is about 60-40 academic to community. We're seeing -- we are seeing reordering from accounts. We don't have the specificity as a lot of it's going through specialty distributors, so we don't have the preciseness that we'd like to and perhaps we'll look into for future calls. But as I mentioned, we're getting good penetration in our top accounts and most of our usage is coming from there. And we are seeing reordering. And then, I think there was a question around peak revenue in -- I think it was specifically for UKONIQ. And I don't know if that question was around marginal zone and follicular specifically. But our view on that has not changed. We still see this as being a significant revenue opportunity. I think Mike, remind me what we've said in the past.
Mike Weiss: Yes. So, I'll take that one. So in terms of the positioning of UKONIQ and MZL and follicular as -- basically, that's a way for us to introduce TG to the world. That's been something that we said a year before the launch, six months before the launch, at the launch and now four months after the launch, we continue to believe that the UKONIQ introduction and marginal zone and follicular, most important is not about revenues, it's about introducing TG and UKONIQ for future impact in primarily CLL. And we said that -- consistently, we've said we think it's still marginal zone and follicular could be a few hundred million dollar revenue opportunity over time. I think that -- remember, we're taking away almost 40% of our sales right now. And if that's a trend that continues, it's a pretty big discount. But again, we think certainly at the point in which there's a few hundred million dollars of revenue potential, TG could be in a position to help fund hopefully with others, charitable organizations that can provide support for those patients. So I think it's -- at these levels, it's interesting to see that we're giving away so much for UKONIQ. But like I said, we made this very clear that we wanted to have a great experience for UKONIQ in marginal zone and follicular, and we did not anticipate giving away almost 40% free goods. But having said that, that's fine. We're happy to do it if it builds goodwill in the industry, and we want to make sure patients all have access. So, I think in terms of the consistency of that message, we've been extremely consistent about where we're positioning this launch. Again, having said that, I think in terms of penetration that we've seen, we've exceeded our expectations to date. And I think if we continue to grow in this marketplace and achieve somewhere in the order of 20% to maybe even as high as 30%, depending on a bull scenario, marginal zone and follicular, a few hundred million dollar opportunity. Again, we've never -- and we continue to say that the company is not being built on the back of the revenues from -- certainly from the launch phase of marginal zone and follicular, but we are going to be built on the impression and the positive feedback we get from the UKONIQ launch in marginal zone and follicular.
Sean Power: Yes. And Graig, just to clarify the -- my comments on the reordering, we're seeing reordering both in terms of multiple patients from the same accounts, and we're seeing a reordering in terms of refills as well. So just wanted to clarify that.
Graig Suvannavejh: Okay, thanks for that.
Mike Weiss: Thanks, Graig.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Matt Kaplan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Matt Kaplan: Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions. Just a little follow-up on the ULTRA-V program. Can you give us some more color, I guess, on the ULTRA-V Phase 3 study design? Are there -- specifically, are there any differences from the Phase 2 portion of the study?
Mike Weiss: So the Phase 3 study design is U2 plus VEN versus U2. In terms of the actual treatment with U2 plus VEN, the -- I got to double check for you, Matt, but I think we may be using potentially up to three months more of VEN than we used in the Phase 2 portion, but that was only again, just to match up with the current schedule for VEN. But let me just double check for you but otherwise, not much in terms of differences.
Matt Kaplan: Great, helpful. And then, with respect to your BTK inhibitor program, TG-1701, you presented some positive data recently at the medical meetings. What are your current thoughts on the regulatory path or have you identified, I guess, paths or pathways to the product kind of continue to develop it?
Mike Weiss: Yes. I mean, we feel really good about that molecule. The performance has been quite impressive. We've spent a lot of time trying to understand the differences between the doses, and in terms of tolerability profile. Our goal has and continues to be to try to identify the most tolerable regimen to make sure we have the most tolerable BTK inhibitor. So we're working hard on that. In terms of the Phase 3 program, the registration, we've got a few good opportunities. We haven't picked the one yet. But I would expect by early next year, we'll be in a Phase 3 for TG-1701.
Matt Kaplan: Okay, very good. And then, I guess last week, just a little follow-up on, I think it was Ed's question with respect to autoimmune indications, additional autoimmune indications for ublituximab? What -- beyond MS, what's your current thinking in terms of where you're going to bring the product next?
Mike Weiss: Yes. We haven't given any guidance on that yet, Matt, but we're scoping out a number of different opportunities. And as soon as we have some in place, we'll certainly disclose those.
Matt Kaplan: Congrats on the recent progress. And thanks for taking the questions.
Mike Weiss: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Mayank Mamtani with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
Mayank Mamtani: Good morning, team. Thanks for taking our questions. And appreciate the helpful detail here. So just quick one, Adam, on the UKONIQ launch, any early color on what the real-world discontinuation and maybe progression rate might be just to -- I know it's early days, but just to get a handle on what the duration of therapy might be? And then I have a couple of quick follow-ups.
Adam Waldman: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mayank. No, you know it's -- I think it's too early honestly, to comment on that. We're -- yes, it's just too early to comment on that.
Mayank Mamtani: Okay, great. And then, Mike, on the near and long-term guidance, that was very helpful. Any color on the path to profitability, number one? And then also on the 2025 number for sales, does that include a partner for MS sales?
Mike Weiss: It does not include a partner for MS sales. And in terms of a path to profitability, again, I think if we achieve our goal of 2025, $1 billion in sales, my guess is we'll -- we should be profitable by then.
Mayank Mamtani: Okay, great. And just on the pipeline side, anything next we should expect to hear for the CD19, CD47 and maybe a program you don't talk about much, but IRAK4 is of increasing interest to investors, so just when and what we may expect to hear on those two programs, if you may?
Mike Weiss: Yes. So in terms of IRAK4, we've been pretty clear that that program is probably not moving forward for some time now. In terms of the CD47, CD19, that one is moving forward nicely. We've just opened up the US, and hopefully, like I said to have data later this year, if not later this year, then into next year.
Mayank Mamtani: Okay, thanks. Thanks, Mike. And congrats, again, on the progress.
Mike Weiss: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question and answer session. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike Weiss for closing remarks.
Mike Weiss: Great. Thank you very much. And thanks, everyone, again. So just want to wrap up today's call by once again review our upcoming key goals and objectives. So clearly we're going to continue to focus on the commercialization efforts of UKONIQ and relapsed refractory marginal zone and follicular and expand those commercial capabilities in preparation for potential launch in -- of U2 and CLL and also, of course, for ublituximab in relapsing forms of MS. We are working hard towards submitting our BLA for ublituximab in the treatment of option forms of MS in this quarter. And then, of course, as everyone knows, is based on the positive results from the ULTIMATE 1 and 2 Phase 3 trials. In terms of continued enrollment into the study, is obviously, we're going to push hard on the enrollment into the ULTRA-V Phase 3 trial, and enrollment into TG-1701 Phase 2 and hopefully soon to start TG-1701 Phase 3 trial early next year. And continue to push forward with the pipeline of TG-1501, which is the PD-L1 and TG-1801, the CD47, CD19. We've talked at length today about the potential data presentations for later this year. And we are working hard -- I could tell you, we're working very hard to obtain the approval for U2 and CLL by the PDUFA goal date of March 25, 2022. So on behalf of all of us at TG, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you to everyone joining us today. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
