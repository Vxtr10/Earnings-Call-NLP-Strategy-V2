Mike Pearson: Well, thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We are pleased to report an exceptionally strong Q3. On our call today, I will review our results, highlight the key drivers of our successful performance across all our businesses, and update you on recent and near-term product launches. Howard will then provide an update on our financial performance and update on our B&L integration, and our expectations for the remainder of 2014. Finally, we will provide you a brief update on our offer for Allergan. After our remarks, Howard, Ari Kellen, and I will be available for Q&A. For the quarter, our total revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 33% over the prior year. This is our second best revenue quarter ever. Our cash EPS was $2.11, an increase of 48% over the prior year and well in excess of our guidance. Our adjusted cash flow from operations for the quarter was $771 million, an increase of 89% over the prior year. GAAP cash flow from operations was $619 million, a 207% increase over the prior year. This quarter's exceptionally strong cash flow generation resulted in a cash conversion of 107% of adjusted cash net income. Great execution by our employees around the world led to exceptional results this quarter. Our results are within or above the high end of our guidance for all key metrics. Our same-store’s organic growth for the total company, including the full impact of generics exceeded our early read of the quarter. Bausch & Lomb continued its outstanding performance and achieved double-digit organic growth, in line with our guidance for the second half of 2014. Our revenues are at the high end of our guidance even with the negative $31 million FX impact, and our cash EPS significantly exceeded guidance even with a negative FX impact of $0.04. Adjusted cash flow from operations of $771 million significantly exceeded our guidance of 90% cash conversion. Our restructuring charges continued to decrease and were below our expectations as we near the end of the B&L integration. Turning to organic growth, our overall same-store company organic growth, including all generics, was 19% for the quarter. If we had excluded generics in Q3, our total company same-store organic growth would have been 3% higher or 22%. In Q2, our total same-store’s organic growth with generics was 4% and without generics was 10%, a differential of 6%. The differential narrowed as the generic impact of Zovirax, Retin-A Micro, and BenzaClin have annualized and are largely behind us in the US, and due to the inclusion of Bausch & Lomb in our same-store organic growth calculations from August 5 onward. The impact of generic entrants in Q4 2013 for both Vanos and Wellbutrin XL in Canada have not yet annualized and are included in our Q3 organic growth and our Q4 organic growth guidance. Vanos and Wellbutrin XL in Canada were both annualized at the end of the year. All of our regions contributed to the strong total company organic growth with our US business at 29%, our total developed market business at 22%, and our emerging market business at 12% same-store organic growth. Our same-store organic growth through the first three quarters of 2014 year-to-date is 11%. We expect continued strong double-digit same-store organic growth in the fourth quarter, but certainly reduced from the 19% we achieved this quarter. And therefore, we expect double-digit organic growth for the full year 2014. B&L continued its strong performance, delivering 12% organic growth in Q3, adjusted only for FX. There is no adjustment for the discontinuation of Bromday. B&L's third quarter revenues in 2012, 2013, and 2014 has been consistent at approximately 24% to 25% of B&L's annual revenues. Under Valeant's ownership, B&L has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 10%. We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. Our businesses broadly performed well beyond our expectations this quarter. The turnaround of our base dermatology business coupled with a number of strong launches including Jublia, Luzu, and RAM 0.08% was the strongest outperformer. Neurology exceeded forecast primarily due to the growth in Xenazine, Wellbutrin XL, and our orphan products. In addition, a number of our smaller businesses, including dental, US generics, and Obagi performed well above their forecasted growth. Our emerging markets and B&L also contributed strong double-digit growth. Importantly, for the total company, more of our growth was from volume than price. As promised, we are continuing to show revenue for the quarter and year-to-date for our top 20 products, as well as the primary growth driver of either price or volume for each product. Top 20 products grew this quarter. 17 of our top 20 products are the same as the second quarter. New additions to the top 20 products this quarter include the Retin-A franchise, which includes RAM 0.08%, Cardizem CD AG, and Ziana. The products which are no longer in the top 20 this quarter include Thermage Tips, Acanya, as well as the Excimer Laser. Year-to-date revenue for our top 20 products is $1.8 billion, representing 31% of our total revenue, the same percentage of total revenue as the second quarter. In total, our top 20 products grew 32% in the third quarter year-over-year and 16% year-to-date over the last year with approximately 50% of the growth coming through volume. All 20 of our largest products showed growth in the third quarter year-over-year. Jublia is currently our 28th largest product, demonstrating a strong start since launch, and we expect it to be a top 20 product next quarter. No product represents greater than 3.5% of our total revenues this quarter, which again demonstrates the diversification of our business. Our mix of the top 20 products includes Rx products, OTC, and devices. These products continue to demonstrate the durability and diversity of our portfolio. Highlights for our US business and the rest of the world are contained in the next four slides. We have expanded our disclosure in Table 3 of our press table to include additional data for US businesses. Revenue and growth numbers for this table are actual and do not include sales for Bausch & Lomb before August 5, 2013. Revenues for our dermatology business, including the recent PreCision acquisition, grew 33% quarter-over-quarter. The turnaround of our dermatology business is continuing. New leadership has brought stability to the sales force and has led to innovative new marketing approaches that are working well. This has resulted in market share and revenue gains across the portfolio, including launched products. Elidel, Acanya, Zyclara, and Ziana have all gained market share since the beginning of 2014. Elidel has had an exceptional year, increasing market share from 45% to 52% and has overtaken Protopic as the leader in this category. After years of decline, Solodyn market share has stabilized. On the new product side, both Jublia and Luzu quickly gained share with Jublia reaching 7% script share of the total onychomycosis market, both branded and generics, and Luzu accelerating is script share to 13% of the branded topical antifungal market. In addition, quarter-over-quarter result growth for all of our dermatology promoted brands was over 40%. Our consumer business grew 43% quarter-over-quarter. Our consumer healthcare business, as reported by IRI, is one of the fastest growing OTC healthcare companies in the US this year. Key consumer growth brands include CeraVe, PreserVision, Ocuvite and BioTrue Multipurpose Solutions. Our prescription ophthalmology revenues grew 57% quarter-over-quarter. Our core brands, Prolensa and the Lotemax franchise, continue to grow and are complemented by the strong performance at Besivance, Zylet and Zirgan. Revenues for our contact lens business grew 82% quarter-over-quarter. According to third-party data, the business has expanded its US market share from 7% to over 10% since our acquisition of B&L. BioTrue ONEday and PureVision 2 for presbyopia continue to capture market share. Our new lens Bausch & Lomb Ultra was now a significant contributor to revenues today as it's only produced on our pilot line, has received very positive reviews from eye care professionals and will be an important new product in our lens franchise. Our surgical business continued its strong performance with 74% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. We continued to improve our market position at IOLs. According to Market Scope data, we are now the number two player in the Posterior Chamber IOL market in the US. As we continue to further invest in this business, key products that will continue to drive growth include the enVista and Trulign IOLs and Victus and [ph] Solaris equipment platforms. Revenue growth of 40% for our neuro and other portfolio was driven by promoted brands including Xenazine, Wellbutrin XL and Syprine/Cuprimine. Our generics business benefited both from portfolio expansion and competitor stock-outs. New customers and strong early performance of launch products such as Onset, a local anesthetic, continue to drive our dental business, resulting in a 20% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. Finally in aesthetics, Obagi demonstrated excellent quarter-over-quarter organic growth of 21% as a result of improved sales force effectiveness. Now turning to the rest of the world, our emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East continued to demonstrate strong performance with 36% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, even with a significant FX impact of negative $18 million in revenues. Russia, Ukraine and CIS continue their strong performance, demonstrated 20% organic growth. Revenues for our emerging market business in Asia and Africa grew 66% quarter-over-quarter. China's 11% pro forma organic growth was driven primarily by the lens franchise. Our iNova, Southeast Asia, South Africa business pro forma organic growth was 18%. In Latin America, quarter-over-quarter revenue growth was 13%. This strong organic growth of 12% from ex-fill was offset by the continued economic slowdown in Brazil and Argentina and import restrictions in Argentina. In addition, our export business was negatively impacted by capital controls in Venezuela. The rest of the world developed markets grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. Australia benefited this quarter from a strong cough and cold season, which contributed to its 15% same-store organic growth rate. Our Western European business grew mid single-digit organically. This growth was offset by a decline in our Canadian business, which is primarily due to Wellbutrin XL being genericized as well as foreign exchange. We are off to a great start in both the US and Canada post the launch of Jublia in July. Jublia script trends in the US are currently at 5,831 scripts per week through the week ending October 10th. Canada monthly script trends are currently 5,462 scripts per month through the month end September, an impressive 18% market share after only three months. This performance increases our confidence in our ability to significantly exceed our estimates for Jublia of $150 million in 2015 and $300 million of revenue in 2016. We continue to believe that Jublia will likely become our largest product. We are investing in the growth of Jublia through a comprehensive marketing campaign and an expanded sales force. In the first half of the third quarter prior to the FDA review of our promotional materials, we were only able to sell Jublia using the package insert. In the second half of the third quarter, we began the roll-out of our print and digital campaigns to both divisions and consumers. Our results to date are prior to our planned TV advertising, which the FDA completed its review of last week. We plan to be on air by mid-November. Our initial sales plan have included a contract to primary care sales force. After assessing the effectiveness of the sales force at the end of Q3, we have decided to shift this brand to additional dermatology representatives and consumer advertising. Between the US and Canada, we have approximately 175 sales representatives consisting of both podiatry and dermatology representatives selling Jublia. Luzu uptake continues to grow since launch with current script volume accounting for 13% of the branded topical antifungal market. Luzu has broken the 1,300 prescription per week level for the week ending October 10th. Luzu performance has benefited from the expanded dermatology and podiatry through the same sales force that is also selling Jublia. Retin-A Micro pump 0.08% uptake has exceeded expectations since its launch in early July. After only 15 weeks, we have exceeded 1,400 prescriptions per week. Retin-A is the most widely recognized brand name in dermatology. The entire Retin-A franchise including our generics brand is growing strongly. In our 2015 outlook, both Retin-A Micro 0.08% and Onexton were expected to generate $35 million of revenues. We now expect Retin-A Micro 0.08% to generate $35 million on its own in 2015, thus providing additional upside for our 2015 outlook. Other recently launched products in the US are also contributing to our current and expect to contribute to our future business. BioTrue ONEday lens continues to accelerate. For the second quarter in a row, it grew over 90% per year. Bausch & Lomb Ultra, a recently introduced lens, is selling to capacity on a pilot line. While Ultra only contributed less than $5 million in revenue to our current quarter, we expect this to increase significantly when commercial quantities are available from our first installed commercial line in the second quarter of 2015. The double-digit organic of our surgical business is benefiting from the successful launch of the Trulign Toric IOL. In addition, with the approval of the Victus lens fragmentation indication, we expect to place 28 Victus machines in 2014, twice as many as in 2013, which will position for pull-through sales of IOLs and other consumables in future years. In our consumer business, we continue to promote and gain physician recommendations for our 2014 launches of CeraVe Baby, part of the extended continued expansion of the brand; Peroxiclear, a superior hydrogen peroxide-based lens cleaner; and SootheXP, a dry eye product. In addition to the products launched, we have a rich pipeline of near-term launches with significant commercial potential. Consistent with our business model, these products have been sourced both internally and externally. Our expected near-term US Rx launches include Onexton, Vesneo and Lotemax Next Generation. Onexton, a new combination acne product, was developed internally. We have a PDUFA date of November 30th and expect to launch in early 2015. We recently announced positive Phase III results for Vesneo, a novel nitric oxide-donating glaucoma product to treat intraocular pressure for patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. We expect to file the NDA in the first half of 2015. As a reminder, Vesneo beat XALATAN in a previous Phase II study. Lotemax Next Generation, which also received positive Phase III results, will allow to extend the life of the Lotemax franchise. We're also very excited about the potential for Emerade, an adrenaline auto-injector for anaphylaxis. After launching in selected European markets in the first half of 2014, we are off to strong start in Germany and Europe, with more than 20% market share in the UK and Sweden and approximately 6% market share in Germany where we just launched a month ago. Emerade is currently undergoing stability trials in the US. We continue to extend CeraVe brands with various planned launches including a CeraVe hydrating cleansing bar, which locks in moisture three times longer than a leading cleansing bar, Dove, and six times longer than the Cetaphil bar. We will also be extending the Ocuvite brand with the introduction of gummies, the fastest growing vitamin segment in the first quarter 2015. We recently completed a Phase III study for our eye whitening physician-dispensed product, Brimonidine. We are filing our NDA submission in the first quarter of 2015. Since our second quarter earnings call, we signed and closed several transactions including Croma, Zarracom and several others that we highlighted last quarter. We recently signed a deal to acquire the worldwide rights to Croma's ophthalmic and orthopedic portfolio. Croma's products consists primarily of viscoelastics and IOLs with existing sales concentrated in Western Europe. We are very excited to bring these products to other markets including the US, Asia and elsewhere around the world. As another addition to our surgical portfolio, we completed a transaction with Zarracom, which is based in Turkey. Zarracom provides us a lower price point IOL in Europe. A quick update on transactions that we highlighted last quarter are now closed, these transactions will also contribute to further penetration in attractive international markets. PT Armoxindo Farma and MedPharma will provide important on-the-ground presence in Indonesia and the Middle East respectively. Bescon based in South Korea presents us a global opportunity to expand our contact lens business through their full range of both clear and color, high and lower end lenses including a daily si-hy lens. With this, I will now turn the call over to Howard.
Howard Schiller: Thank you, Mike. We are very excited to report exceptional Q3 results across all of our key businesses. Our revenue was in excess of $2 billion with our US and emerging market businesses contributing strong double-digit same-store organic growth. In addition, while we've recently had a number of successful launches, they added only 3% to organic growth this quarter. These products and the other products Mike just reviewed as near-term launches are expected to contribute significantly to organic growth in 2015 and 2016. Our impressive revenue growth of 33% and cash EPS growth of 48% in Q3 were off of a strong Q3 2013. If you recall, Q3 of last year was a very good quarter, but we suffered from the generiazation of Zovirax, RAM and BenzaClin when comparing that quarter to Q3 2012. In addition, Q3 2012 was particularly strong given that we sold approximately $90 million of Zovriax following a stock-out in Q2 of 2012. Our cost of goods sold improved in the third quarter, primarily due to product mix, resulting in improved gross margins of 74% of sales. We're expecting a similar gross margin in the fourth quarter subject to foreign exchange movements. While SG&A percentage improved each quarter this year, SG&A remains above-historical levels, as expected, at 24% of sales primarily due to costs associated with our numerous launch products. Excluding these launch costs, our SG&A would have been less than 22% of sales. The table on this page shows change in foreign exchange spot rates since our July 31st earnings call. The currency order is based on the financial impact of currency movement versus our Q3 guidance given on July 31st. Move of the movement in currencies occurred in September as the dollar significantly strengthened versus most currencies around the world. The negative impact in our third quarter revenue and cash EPS relative to our July 31st guidance was $31 million and $0.04 of earnings per share. We were able to absorb all of this impact and so generate revenue at the upper end of our guidance and delivered cash EPS above our guidance. Looking forward to our fourth quarter, at current rates, the negative impacts of revenues and cash EPS would be approximately $53 million and approximately $0.06 per share. Obviously our results will be impacted either up or down with further movements in FX rates. As we've discussed previously, we continue to look for opportunities to produce products locally in order to create more of a natural hedge and reduce the bottomline impact of currency swings. As we discussed in our second quarter earnings conference call, given that we've passed the one-year anniversary of Bausch & Lomb and we have not done any significant large transactions, we expected our restructuring and integration charges to decline significantly in the second half of the year. This quarter, our restructuring and integration charges declined from $143 million in Q2 to $63 million in Q3, less than our guidance of $70 million. The restructuring and integration charges included charges of approximately $3 million for deals completed in Q3 for Armoxindo Farma and Bescon, which were not included in our July estimates due to the uncertainty of timings of close. We expect a further reduction in our fourth quarter restructuring charges to less than $50 million and in the first quarter of 2015 to less than $25 million. This quarter, our GAAP and adjusted cash flow from operations are the highest in Valeant's history. As we said in the past, we're extremely focused on converting the maximum amount of net income to cash flow. Our adjusted cash flow from operations this quarter were $771 million, resulting in 107% cash conversion for the quarter and 97% cash conversion year-to-date, both well above our guidance of 90%. In addition, in the absence of significant business development activity, our GAAP and adjusted operating cash flows will converge as cash payments for restructuring and integration wind down. At the beginning of the year, we set a strategic objective to reduce our leverage ratio to four times or below. We achieved this goal this quarter by reducing our term loans by $1.1 billion, resulting in a net leverage ratio of approximately four times adjusted pro forma EBITDA, down from 4.4 times at the beginning of 2014. In addition to our term loan repayment in Q3, we recently redeemed $500 million of bonds in Q4. Our days sales outstanding have continued to decline this quarter to 64 days from 66 days in Q2 and 72 days in Q1. As we've previously discussed, we believe the calculating DSOs based on gross sales and gross account receivables makes sense for us, given the fact that we have a number of older products and there are large amount of provisions to gross sales to get to net sales. This quarter we are adding additional disclosure in our 10-Q that will allow investors to calculate our days sales outstanding using gross quarterly sales and gross accounts receivables. We've included that table in the appendix of this presentation. Our overall accounts receivable this quarter increased by $109 million with an offsetting increase in accrued liabilities of approximately $90 million related to rebates, returns and allowances. This is a net increase of approximately $20 million compared to an increase of approximately $30 million in net sales. In addition, our US Rx wholesale inventory levels with the major wholesalers were flat this quarter on a unit basis and lower on a dollar basis compared to levels at the end of Q2. We are thrilled with the integration and performance of Bausch & Lomb during our first year of ownership. As we've said many times in the past, this successful integration will serve us the blueprint of Allergan. Since closing, we've accelerated organic growth from less than 5% to 10%. This increased growth rate has been achieved by continued strength in the pharmaceuticals business, the turnaround of the lens and surgical businesses, a combined consumer business with increased scale, the benefit from our decentralized approach and leveraging our emerging market capabilities for our expanded business. We've also had numerous successful recent product launches shown on this slide, which will be key growth drivers going forward. Our integration has progressed well since close. As of today, we have achieved almost all of our targeted synergies. Remaining synergies will be achieved on a run rate basis by the end of the year and are primarily related to manufacturing in Europe and small amounts in a number of other areas. Our cost to achieve these synergies has been a bit higher than expected due to cost to achieve synergies outside the US. We've also added many great people to our organization at all levels, many of whom are leading some of the most important businesses. We look forward to implementing the same formula of success for acquisitions going forward including Allergan. We remain very confident in the future growth prospects for Valeant. We expect more than 10% in-store sales organic growth in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance by almost all of the businesses. We're very excited about the strong start of our recent launch products and the further potential to look forward to 2015 and 2016. Given this strength, we are increasing our fourth quarter guidance for cash EPS by $0.10 to $2.45 to $2.55 per share. Our revenue guidance for Q4 remains unchanged at $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. We're also adjusting our full year 2014 guidance to reflect the outperformance in our third quarter and our increased guidance for Q4. Revenue will be in the $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion. Cash EPS has increased to $8.22 to $8.32 per share. And adjusted cash flow from operations updated to greater than $2.5 billion, which assumes at least 90% cash conversion for the year. Q4 tends to have a disproportionate amount of revenue in December and therefore we are conservatively projecting upward in cash flow for Q4. By year-end, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 3.9 times to adjusted pro forma EBITDA. Our strengthening balance sheet will give us flexibility to deploy capital for business development and/or share repurchase in 2015. With the backdrop of this quarter's strong performance, the strength of our overall business and increasing confidence around a number of the launch products including the potential of Jublia, we are increasing our 2015 outlook. We now expect organic revenue growth of 10% or more relative to the 9% growth in our July outlook. Gross margin is expected to improve to 75% relative to our previous outlook of 74% based on the fact that now current gross margin is in the 74% range plus the expected improved mix, decline in Xenazine revenue and current cost improvement initiatives. We expect our SG&A margins to be in the 23% to 24% range, which is in line with our prior guidance of low to mid-20% of revenue. SG&A will continue to be above historical levels in 2015 due to our planned investment in new products. In addition, we still expect our tax rate to be in the 5% to 6% range. This updated outlook results in cash EPS of $10 per share assuming no acquisitions, a 21% increase of 2014. With acquisitions, we expect to be able to significantly add incremental cash EPS. Now turning to Allergan, we remain completely committed and focused on completing the Allergan transaction. Six months ago when we made the offer to Allergan, to date the Allergan Board and management have been unwilling to engage with us or take the time to better understand our strategy and business model. We remain open to speaking with Allergan in any time they decide to engage. If we did not hear from Allergan's management prior to December, we look forward to the December 18 Special Meeting that has been called by Pershing Square where shareholders will be given the opportunity to remove a majority of Allergan's Board. We believe that Allergan's shareholders need to remove a majority of the Directors in order for Allergan to be compelled to negotiate. The record date to vote at the Special Meeting is Thursday, October 30th. Shares would need to be purchased by Monday October 27th in order to be a shareholder of record for the meeting. The combination of Valeant and Allergan creates an unrivaled platform for value creation for both sets of shareholders. As we've discussed in the past, the two businesses are highly complementary and under the leadership of the Valeant management team, we'll apply our integration blueprint to maximize the efficiency of the combined company, while still retaining appropriate levels of R&D spend to drive future growth and innovation. The economic choice is clear. In 2016, an Allergan shareholder will have greater than $20 cash EPS per Allergan share in a combination with Valeant as compared to approximately $10 per share cash EPS for standalone Allergan. Until we hear from Allergan Board and management, we'll hear from the Allergan shareholders based on the Special Meeting vote. We will stay focused in driving value in our business. We're extremely excited about our prospects as we look forward for the remainder of the year and into 2015 and beyond. And with that, we'll now open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna Financial Group.
Andrew Finkelstein: From all these results and the details across businesses you've been giving, what message should Allergan shareholders most take that might change views of the combined company for anyone who is not convinced about the staying power of the combined company?
Mike Pearson: From the very beginning since we announced our offer to Allergan, they've always held up Q3 as sort of a litmus test in terms of our ability to sustain growth. And Q3 was the quarter where B&L annualized , and I think the message they gave to their shareholders was that the wheels are going to fall off the bus in terms of B&L and that the rest of the value in business would continue to decline. I think this quarter, through facts and through performance, we demonstrated both those assertions are incorrect. So I think our hope is that the Allergan shareholders just look at the numbers, look at the performance, and see that the value offering model does work and will continue to work. A combination of day-to-day strong execution and our R&D model, sourcing innovation both inside and outside leads to lots of new products and in a very diversified business model, both in terms of geographies and products. So we'll just encourage the Allergan shareholders to take a look at our results and compare them to what Allergan has been asserting since the beginning.
Andrew Finkelstein: If you could talk a little bit about the lessons from the Jublia launch, what's worked well, and you mentioned some shifts in the spending away from primary care, contract sales to additional in-house resources, but what’s the primary care role for that product ultimately to maximize the opportunity? And then on the Bausch & Lomb side, very large organic growth rates from some new launches in the surgical business, is there any details you could share on market share gains and what we should think about for that business in the near term?
Mike Pearson: In terms of the Jublia launch, our team has just done a fantastic job. Ari Kellen is here and Deb Jorn who leads the business unit have just done a fabulous job. I think the keys to success so far have been a real stability of motivation of the sales representatives. They're doing a terrific job. And again lots and lots of calls, they're excited by the product since it's such a great product. I think the digital marketing campaign has proved to be very, very effective. It's quite easy to measure an ROI in terms of digital activity. And what we're most excited about is actually the TV that will soon be running. If you look at the impact of television on other dermatology launches like Epiduo and ACZONE, which is an Allergan product, you've seen huge increases when DTC goes on air. And that's the key to getting to the primary care audience. I think what we found was detailing them without something to draw the patients into the offices probably doesn't work as well as just getting the consumers -- make the consumers aware of this product and have them come into the office. So, it's only the start, but if you annualize the sales of Jublia based on a most recent week, it's somewhere between $70 million and $80 million a year already. And if we were to take away our zero co-pay, which at some point we will, we're approaching $100 million of annual revenue even at today's run rate, so we expect that to be closer to $200 million by the end of this year and we feel very, very good about the launch, and it is all due to the team we have in place . In terms of surgical market share, I think we've increased our market share about 3 percentage points across sort of all categories since we acquired B&L. Part of it is the new products, but part of it's led by Andy Chang in the US who is doing a great job. I think there's just a lot more focus. And again, I think the sales force incentives have been fixed and I think that the new frag approval for the Victus machine coupled with some of the – in addition, some of the Croma products that we're going to bring into the US is really going to – really secure sort of a bright future for that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: The Valeant stock on this revised guidance, it's 12 times 2015 earnings, obviously very expensive valuation. When we consider potential revisions or changes to your bid heading into December 18 meeting, is there a leverage ceiling we should think about at Valeant? I guess just to me, it seems like it would be a lot cheaper to finance a deal with more debt versus equity at this point? In your presentation, you talked about your ability to achieve more synergies with Allergan than anybody. Is there a minimum rate of return we should think about for large acquisitions such as Allergan (inaudible)? I'm just trying to gauge your ability. If someone else emerges, you probably have more synergies, in your ability, is there some threshold at which point you just don't go any higher, I know you don’t give any specific numbers, but just how do we think about that if a process emerges?
Howard Schiller: If we were to improve our proposal, how we think about it, clearly with our stock where it's at, we much prefer cash over stock, and we said that number of times. And we are just balancing that with making sure that we come out of the merger with an incredibly strong balance sheet that will give us the flexibility that we want going forward. So we're looking at all options, but that's how we're balancing the two. And as we said before, we would be willing to sit down and improve our offer. And when we do that, we'll make that decision -- when we think it's the right time, we will make that decision. We define winning as delivering value to our shareholders. And we have very high hurdles for how we deploy capital. In this case, we have significantly more synergies than anybody, the combination of the unique business overlap that we have, our emerging market infrastructure and our operating model, which allows us to extract more synergies. And so that's all factored in. We will be disciplined. As you rightly said, we can't and won't give you a precise number. But we'll be disciplined. But again, we should own Allergan. We have the most synergies and Allergan shareholders will benefit the most with the combination with Valeant.
Chris Schott: Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the differentiation you see versus existing agents that get you comfortable with those peak sales assumptions?
Ari Kellen: Vesneo is the first monotherapy that's statistically better than Latanoprost as we put out in our Phase II dose ranging study and the Phase III study, which we published, showed the lowering of 7.5 millimeters to 9.1 millimeters of mercury. Other prostaglandins, in particular the XALATAN label are more close to 6 millimeters to 8 millimeters of mercury drop in pressure from baseline. So we're also encouraged by the safety data that we have now. We also have additional secondary endpoints that we're discussing with the FDA that are unique that will demonstrate the efficacy of our drug, which we're not able to share that at this time. The other point on that is our IOLs are excited at this drug, and there is section that the current IOL has been pretty positive. So we believe in the growth prospects of this differentiated compound.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei: Howard, just a follow-up to your earlier comments about the having more synergies than the other combination, are you getting a chance to make that comparative argument with Allergan shareholders and could you comment on some of the feedback you've been receiving? How do you expect the break-up of the Shire-AbbVie deal to impact your prospects, given the significant role we expect the bench of investors to play heading in for the Special Meeting?
Howard Schiller: I don't think anyone has debated or disagreed with the fact that Valeant and Allergan, there's unique business overlap. I think there's general agreement in our ability to extract the synergies. And again, through the business overlap and through our unique operating model, we've had some interesting debates with people. But generally, I think agreement that there'll be significant synergies and more synergies from us than from any other player. There hasn't been any push-back in addition. We obviously have a differentiated tax rate as well. So we can't predict and protect ourselves against people from doing irrational things, but just focused on the economics and the facts. We clearly have the most to bring to the table. And in terms of the impact that Shire AbbVie deal has, clearly there was some losses taken by the even-driven people last week. I think that in Allergan's case, there's already significant ownership by the hedge fund community and I think that a growing sense that a transaction is going to happen. So I think that's all positive. And again, we're committed to getting this transaction done, which is important to that community. And we're going to march on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Steinberg from Jefferies.
David Steinberg: Looks like in the prescription graph that you added up the : Wolters Kluwer and the Specialty Pharmacy data. I was just curious what's the rough breakout between the prescription and other information and that you get through your Specialty Pharmacy. And secondly, is sampling still a significant part of your program? And if so, perhaps how much through scripts buy? And then could you give us an update on how managed care discussions are going on that product?
Mike Pearson: In terms of the breakdown, the Specialty Pharmacy channels, actually multiple specialty pharmacies throughout the United States, but the rough script breakdown is about 40% of the volume is going through specialty pharma and 60% is going through traditional pharmacies. Sampling is not a key part of what we're doing. One of the reasons is you may recall that we had to shift manufacturers to our Japanese partner, which is doing a terrific job for us, where they only have trade size bottles at this point. And so until we get more sample bottles, we would expect to start sampling next year once we get the smaller bottle. Our conversation so far is going well. I think we do have unique product and there is a strong consumer and physician demand for it. And I think we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to get excellent managed care coverage.
David Steinberg: You had indicated your guidance for next year, $150 million could be substantially exceeded, that the run rate at the end of this year could actually be close to that. Any thoughts on what perhaps the new number might look like?
Mike Pearson: In terms of next year sales for Jublia, well, if our run rate at the end of the year is 200, then certainly $150 million would be a little bit light as an estimate. So we haven't gone through where it's probably closer to the $400 million range, $300 million to $400 million. But that is a bit of an estimate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sachin Shah from Albert Fried.
Sachin Shah: There has been some speculation that you're going to maybe consider improving your offer. I know you've talked about that in various ways. But in light of the fact that the record-day is coming up on the 30th and shares as you mentioned in the presentation can be acquired on the 27th, so just want to find out in light of kind of the market volatility and dislocation, is that something that you've been considering because of dislocation and just to kind of solidify the December 18th meeting?
Mike Pearson: Actually we considered every day, as Howard said, that we do have some more dry powder at the appropriate time when the conditions are right. Again, our preference is to sit down with management, but I think we all know that's unlikely with the current management team and Board. And so we want today to be all better reads. But it's certainly exciting that we're contemplating and we may make that decision at any point in time.
Sachin Shah: As far as the record date is concerned, should we use that as a gauge or is that not important to you, because you already have as much as 40% of the shareholders leaning into the December 18th meeting? I just want to understand the level of importance for the shareholder meeting, because you already a significant amount of support. Are you looking for more or is it that the potential boost that you're considering is for that reason and to make sure that you get to the finish line here?
Howard Schiller: Well, the record date is obviously an important date, and we've thought about in the context of the overall transaction. I think the reality is that most of the shares have found their own home already. The people that own them now, the institutions that decided to take profits and sell it done so, the hedge funds or significant holders, Pershing has their stake and a number of the institutions that are in it for long haul have increased their stakes. So if the volumes are significantly down even on big news days or significantly down, there's always going to be some trading post of record date. That's just reality. But for the most part, the shares have found the right home and the people that own the shares are the people that are going to vote come December 18th.
Sachin Shah: There's been some speculation by the media with your relationship with Ackman. Just can you confirm that that relationship is solid going into the shareholder meeting?
Mike Pearson: Absolutely, we continue a very good relationship with Will Ackman and Pershing. And I think our interests are aligned. We both want to get this deal done and we are both committed and will work hard to make it happen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Annabelle Samimy from Stifel.
Annabelle Samimy: You have some very strong increased outlook. I guess my question is what's changed between last quarter and this quarter that's made this positive outlook so strong. We've pretty much known about the annualization of Bausch & Lomb and the annualization of the generics. So what is it that's the biggest driver of your increased outlook from this point forward?
Mike Pearson: I think it's primarily dermatology in the US where we've had really complete turnaround. All the promoted brands are growing. We are very excited about our launch products, Jublia, RAM 0.08% and Luzu. We're increasingly optimistic about Onexton because of some of the unique data we have on that. And so I think that's the primary driver. But also every business around the world with exception of maybe one or two are outperforming with great momentum. We have a lot of smaller launches everything from CeraVe to the surgical business, we just see significantly more upside. And when you add all the numbers together, I think we can still say it's a conservative outlook, which is much improved from our previous one. We will be giving guidance for 2015 at our normal time, and I would expect that to be better than our outlook.
Annabelle Samimy: And just on that point of different businesses doing better than expected, I guess one of the questions we've also gotten often is the contact lens business appears to be growing significantly higher than the overall market and it's a relatively stag market without that much market changes from quarter-to-quarter. So can you help us understand what's driving that growth?
Mike Pearson: B&L is just doing an excellent job. So it's brought real life to the franchise. We've upgraded our management team across the board with some new hires. We're increasing our sales force from 120 to 180. And we have some great new products. BioTrue Daily which was not being focused on, which was launched maybe a year before we acquired B&L, was doubling each quarter, doubling the growth of that brand. Ultra, the reception has been terrific in terms of adopters and it's just a question of getting the commercial lines up, which we will. But you also have to remember, it's off a very small base. Bausch & Lomb's market share had fallen to 6% in the United States and had been on the decline for a decade. So it's a lot easier to gain share if you're a very small player. And so we're doing it and we're doing it through volume. We've kept our prices complete constant. We've not been discounting, but we've not been taking any price and we're just doing it through better products and a more focused team. The combination of having both Ultra and BioTrue Daily has changed the physicians' image of Bausch & Lomb. And so we're very excited about the contact lens business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Guggenheim.
Louise Chen: I'm not suggesting that you should do this, but just curious as we obviously get a lot of questions on this, at what point, Valeant is willing to walk away from the Allergan deal in terms of timing, valuation, how you think about that? You did say you're going to be diligent about assessing deals.
Mike Pearson: Look, we now have a record date. We've had to fight long and hard. We had to win a bunch of court cases. We now have a record date. We have annualized the third quarter. We delivered a very strong third quarter and basically have shown through performance that all the allegations made by Allergan are just wrong. They put out another note this morning. We've gone through it. Again, they're all wrong. So I think that we're in very good position to win this thing. And so we look forward to the upcoming vote. And there's no way we're going to walk away at this point. We'll wait until December 18th.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang from CRT Capital.
Tim Chiang: I was looking at the pipeline chart and you have this product, Emerade. What's the limiting factor in giving an auto-injector for anaphylaxis in the market earlier than late 2015 in the US? I mean what do you have to do between now and then to get this product on the market?
Mike Pearson: There's only two things, one, stability data. It's a 36-month dating on this product, which is one of many aspects that make through period of product to the current product on the market. And then there's sort of this time and motion study. You have to show that it's easy enough for patients to use. We'll hopefully beat that date. The European Union is actually contemplating currently whether they just recommend this product across the board, given its significant benefits compared to what's out there in the market. So it's a major, major market in the US. It's over $1 billion alone. And we are doing everything to trying to expedite that, get it approved.
Tim Chiang: I think you had originally highlighted for Jublia that you'd spent about $80 million in the second half of 2014. Given the changes with your marketing, does that number change materially?
Mike Pearson: Actually we're spending more than we originally forecasted for Jublia. We're going to get TV much sooner than we thought. We thought it would not be till early December. It's now going to be early November. We're adding more reps than we originally thought, given the initial success for that. So my guess is the number will probably be closer to $100 million we're spending for that and Luzu which goes to the same markets. And so my guess is we'll over-spend, but we're also getting additional revenues that we didn't expect we were going to get in addition.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Nachman from Goldman Sachs.
Gary Nachman: Mike, of the total organic growth for the company, could you break down the rough split between price and volume? You said more volume than price in the quarter, but maybe just quantify how much price contributed. And then, Howard, with the recent changes in tax policy, will that impact your ability to use your favorable tax structure at all with M&A, including the Allergan deal? I just want to confirm that. Thanks.
Mike Pearson: Gary, I don't have the precise breakdown, and we'll get back to you, I guess, offline. We delivered earnings early this quarter on purpose. We wanted to get it out before the record date. We don't have all the numbers from around the world, but we do know that it's going to be definitely more volume than price.
Gary Nachman: Maybe just comment on that. Where are you seeing the most pricing flexibility in your business?
Mike Pearson: It's in the orphan category and some of our tail products. That's the main area. A lot of our business we get no price surge. You think of contact lenses, there is no price surge, there is no price consumer. When I say no price, it's a low single-digit price. Emerging markets across the world, Europe, no price. And so it's concentrated in sort of tail products in the US.
Howard Schiller: In terms of tax policy, there is nothing that's been talked about. The treasury regulations would have no impact on us. We're not an inverted company. We're not doing these upstream loans, the way some companies are. The hopscotch loans and last week the double Irish structures, we don't have any double Irish structures. Clearly if the (inaudible) restrict interest expense deductions, that would have an impact. And we said that in the past we're well below the Safe Harbor debt to equity ratio. Again our interest expense is real cash interest expense because our debt is almost all in the US. But if that were to have an impact, it wouldn't impact Allergan in the way we're looking at Allergan. We still think there's tax saving upsides if were to able to do due diligence that we haven't factored in yet. Earnings scripting rules are changed, it could have some impact, not huge. We said somewhere 0% and 3% depending on where they end up. But again, it's unclear where they're going to end up.
Mike Pearson: In terms of our 2015 and 2016 outlook, you might notice that our growth rates for the neuro and generics business where again most of price increase opportunity is was only 5%. So we're not assuming that we can continue to take prices. We look to the future. To the extent we can, that's upside. So we're going to do what's the smart thing to do in the short term, but in terms of our long-term outlook on the business, it's probably composed of 80% to 90% volume and 10% to 20% price. And then to the extent we can take more price, that'll be upside to our outlook.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from ISI Group.
Umer Raffat: Mike, I just wanted to get into some numbers with you. So we've run our math on this, but want to get your take on it. So the same-store growth for Valeant has been about 10% on an ex-generic basis for the past several quarters and we know Bausch is growing about 10% as well. So to get to 19%, that's about $140 million in extra revenues. So can you help us quantify what that extra $140 million of extra revenue is in Q3? And then, Howard, one for you, very quickly, if the Allergan bid was raised again, will it continue to be a 20%-plus IRR?
Mike Pearson: The big delta in this quarter, one was probably products, which are launched, Jublia, Luzu, RAM 0.08% and other proxy clear. So these products that just didn't even exist. And so this quarter we have new launches. The second is an acceleration of products that have been launched, but weren't like BioTrue Daily, it's probably another quarter which was growing quite slowly, but now we're growing them 100%, again all volume. So Trulign is another example of a product like that. And the number of Victus we're installing is doubling. So we've accelerated the growth on a number of sort of launch brands from prior years when the hands of Bausch & Lomb. We talked about dental growing 20%. We talked about generics, they've been growing over 20%. Businesses are just outperforming. The business is accelerating. We're not going to report 19% every quarter. I'm not projecting that. But we feel quite comfortable with 10%-plus for the foreseeable future.
Howard Schiller: In terms of a potential increased proposal, for obvious reasons we're not going to get into what we're going to do and when. I think we're pretty clear that we had more to offer and we would do it at the time we thought was right and strategic. And I think you know us well enough to know, we define success as delivering value to our shareholders. I think we're big believers that share prices will correlate with return on capital over time. There's points in time in the market where market falls in love with earnings accretion, but that's not real value. And that's what we're focused on. And we're going to continue to be disciplined and watch carefully where we think the returns are. We're not going to do a transaction if we don't believe our shareholders are getting rewarded for the risk.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.
Gregg Gilbert: Howard, can you quantify the new launches' contribution in the quarter? And you mentioned wholesaler inventory levels in the US were stable, but can you talk about what that level is in terms of weeks?
Howard Schiller: The launches were around 3% this quarter. And again, going forward, when you roll it out to '15 and '16, they'll be a much more significant piece. And I think that's what's get us so excited about the '15 and '16. Someone asked about the confidence level, what gave us the confidence to increase the outlook, if you think about Jublia alone, $82 million equals about 1 percentage point of organic growth in 2015. And we had $150 million for Jublia. Mike talked about potential for Jublia next year. You can see the potential for incremental organic growth. RAM is going to beat what we said RAM and Onexton would do together. So that's additional upside to our organic growth. So I think starting next year, you're really going to see the potential of these launch products to drive organic growth. We've been asked because Allergan has raised issues with investors about inventory levels. Our inventory levels were exactly flat on a unit basis and actually declined on a dollar basis and they've basically flat for most of the year. I don't have the exact number per wholesaler at this point, but they've been flat and declining. And I would expect they'll stand these levels, won't see any benefit of any additional channel add and probably given the growth of a bunch of these products. We probably won't see any have them come down in the near term either.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ram Selvaraju from Aegis Capital.
Ram Selvaraju: I wanted to ask about your feelings regarding Valeant's competitive positioning in the context of the new treasury regulations, which I think are likely to impact tax inversions going forward. So in the context of that, given that you are already in a tax advantage position, what do you think is likely to be the competitive edge that you have and the enhancement to that competitive edge, given the fact that maybe some of your competitors are now going to be less likely to be able to realize tax synergies and therefore should enable you to continue to be competitive on pursuing future acquisitions?
Howard Schiller: I think you sort of answered the question. We're not an inverted company. Those treasury regulations have zero impact on our tax status, our tax rate. And obviously clearly if others are prevented from reducing their tax rate through an inversion, that gives us an advantage. But as Mike and I have said many, many times, our objective is not to compete away, pay away our tax advantage. And that's the perjure for our shareholders and to drive additional cash flows to be able to redeploy to create more value. But we expect that advantage to continue. And again, the treasury regulations have zero impact on us.
Ram Selvaraju: And then just going forward, do you see disproportionate strength in a particular line of the Bausch & Lomb business? And if so, what specific line do you think is most likely to outperform going forward? Is that likely to be more in the contact lens side or on the surgical side?
Mike Pearson: I think it's going to be contact lenses and surgical. I think the pharma business was run quite well by Bausch & Lomb. I think they will continue to do well. It's a great business. The contact lenses, we're very excited about the Ultra lens. Unfortunately we won't have commercial capacity till the second quarter, but we've ordered three additional lines to the first line, because we think this could be a very, very large product given the reception in the marketplace. And we're working from a very small base. So again, it's much easy to improve our market share if you're a small player.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ridgeway from Paradigm Capital.
Alan Ridgeway: Howard, you mentioned that the stronger balance sheet or improvements in the balance sheet would allow you guys the ability to do more BD and potentially return cash to shareholders through a share buyback. Can you guys maybe talk about how you think about that? Do you have some kind of levels earmarked for one versus the other going forward, and would that change whether you do or don't get Allergan in an acquisition?
Howard Schiller: Alan, as you'd expect, we have an internal model. We have a view as to what we believe will work. And whenever we look at an acquisition, we're asking ourselves whether this acquisition will create more value versus buying back our shares. And over the last year, I think we've been hamstrung a little bit on our desire to delever and our commitment to delever plus we tied up our balance sheet with Allergan. We've been frustrated in the fact we haven't been able to repurchase shares, given the levels our stocks traded at most of this year. And as we strengthen our balance sheet and reduce our leverage, we will have that flexibility to make those decisions. So we're just excited. If you look at the modeling we did back in July where I believe we'll have $6 billion to deploy capital for acquisitions, less if we were to repurchase shares because there's no EBITDA that comes in when you repurchase your shares, that gives us a significant amount of firepower in still maintaining a strong balance sheet. And that coupled with the organic growth we've talked about, we believe, really allows us to drive value for shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS.
Marc Goodman: Howard, on Slide 7, I just want to make sure I understand these Bausch & Lomb growth rates, so are these growth rates for the three months that you owned them this year versus the two months that you owned them last year? Or have you made some type of alteration to that to figure out the two months versus two months or something like that? And then second question is, on Slide 23, you list all these new product acquisitions that you've made or are about to make. Can you just give us a sense of how big these are maybe like annual sales for each one just really quickly, just so we have a sense of how much we should be adding in. And obviously you raised sales guidance by a few hundred million for next year. So I'm trying to figure out what part of it comes from that and what part is from the base.
Howard Schiller: First of all, just to be crystal clear, the Q3 2014 is a three months versus the three months. So it's the actual three months. There is no adjustments around the August 5th date. And this is since inception sort of day-to-day accounting that the sales of those first five days in August than looking at the actual sales. And the only adjustments are for FX. So there is no adjustment. There is no acquisition in there. There is no adjustment for any divestures or discontinuations. The decline of Bromday is included in that. When we publish our organic growth, we're very clear that we adjust for discontinuations. In this slide, there has been no adjustments for anything other than FX.
Marc Goodman: So just to be clear, this is the three months that you owned it this year and two months last year plus the one month you didn't own it, but you made it three month, so we got the actual three months versus three months.
Howard Schiller: The actual sales this year and the actual three months since 2013. No adjustments other than FX. In terms of the acquisitions, Croma we knew was going to happen. We just hadn't signed it yet. All the other ones were included and they're quite small right now. Both Bescon and Armoxindo are sort of $15 million, maybe a little bit less in terms of annual revenue. MedPharma is in the same kind of range. Zarracom is even smaller than that. Croma was a little bit large, but that's also included in forecast. So in our 2015 outlook, there are no acquisitions built in and all these small acquisitions have already been factored in.
Marc Goodman: And Croma is how big?
Howard Schiller: Croma is in the $40 million, $50 million range.
Mike Pearson: In terms of the impact on this quarter, as you can see in the footnote, it was about $2 million of sales in Q3 from these acquisitions.
Marc Goodman: And the PreCision Company, that was in the numbers this quarter, right? What kind of revenues did that do this quarter?
Howard Schiller: It was between $15 million and $20 million.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Tony Reiner from Imperial Capital.
Tony Reiner: Can you please just give a quick two minutes on where you currently stand with Mr. Ackman on your earnings achievements in going forward?
Mike Pearson: I'm not sure I understand the question.
Tony Reiner: I know it was on TV last week that you and Mr. Ackman weren't on the same page. So do you want to talk about it on this forum?
Mike Pearson: Sure. Well, there is no basis for those reports. We talk to him frequently. In fact, he was in our office yesterday for a while. And so I think we're completely aligned. We're aligned that we are going to win this battle, that we are going to acquire Allergan. We are committed to marching forward and getting this deal done.
Tony Reiner: Are things proceeding as both of you saw planned? It's obviously been a lengthy process with lots of stuff, plans and stuff like that. But overall, would you say it's gone as you planned?
Mike Pearson: I think early on we thought that we'd probably get this Special Meeting in November. I think we communicated it's happening in December. So maybe it slipped a month, but certainly no more. I think we've been a little surprised by sort of baseless attacks that have been put on our company. They're just not true. And so public companies usually don't put things out that are untrue. But anyways, I think our Q3 performance and our outlook is discrediting those attacks. And personally, I've been surprised by the Board of Directors that they have done no independent analysis. You would have thought one of them might, when we continue to prove everything they said is wrong, have broken ranks. But they haven't and maybe the poor governance. But overall, I think we're happy with where we're at. We're happy that there is a record date. We're pleased with our legal decrees. And we're very pleased with our performance.
Tony Reiner: Where would you say that there is left field and the thing you anticipated less, more than anything, what was that during this process? Just over the timeframe, so yeah, you didn't anticipate the hostility, but overall you are where you want to be and you got the meeting and then you certainly deserve and you and Mr. Ackman both deserve a lot of credit for that. Where was the one, the biggest left field in the last few months that you haven't anticipated? Was it just the hostile nature of them? Was it the leaks in the press? Was it talking down your company? If you had to make one comment on where you didn't anticipate this happening during the process, what would it be?
Mike Pearson: I think I answered that question, which is probably the attacks on us, sort of the viciousness of those attacks would probably be the thing.
Howard Schiller: But the consistent false misleading nature of the comment.
Mike Pearson: So thanks, everyone. I know it was a long call. I appreciate your patience and we'll look forward to talking soon.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
