"Operator: Good morning and good evening ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by for Yalla Group Limited's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After management’s prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Today’s conference call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to your speaker host today, Ms. Kerry Gao, IR Director of the company. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Kerry Gao: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Yalla's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We released our earnings earlier today, and the release is now available on our IR website as well as on newswire services. Before we continue, please note that the discussion today will contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. As such, our future results may be materially different from the views expressed today.
Tao Yang: Thank you, Kerry, and thank you everyone for joining our 2021 first quarter earnings conference call. 2021 is off to a remarkable start. Yalla Group’s total revenue increased almost by 40% Q-on-Q and reached $67.6 million exceeding the upper end of our guidance range by 7.4%. This stellar performance was driven by our continued efforts to grow our user community, the effective conversion of active users into paying users, and the further advancement of our monetization capabilities and initiatives. In the first quarter of 2021, we also maintained robust profitability, as demonstrated by our non-GAAP net margin of 49.7%. With the strong execution of our efforts to raise brand awareness across the Middle East and North Africa region, and our effective marketing campaigns tailored to the local culture, monthly active users for our group increased by 14.6% Q-on-Q and we reached $18.8 million. In addition, increasing user engagement on our platform drove Yalla Group’s paying users up by 11.5% quarter-over-quarter to 5.8 million, leading to outstanding paying ratio of 31.0%. Our ability to monetize also continued to improve as our group's ARPPU grew rapidly by 25.5% quarter-over-quarter, reaching $11.6 in Q1. During previous earnings calls, we announced 4 new products in our pipeline.
Saifi Ismail: Thanks Tao. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As we continue to enrich our product portfolio, including Yalla, Yalla Ludo, and the four new products in the pipeline, we are looking to boost synergies among individual apps to develop a more integrated ecosystem, which will help us improve efficiency in acquiring new users going forward. With this move, we expect to see an increase in the flow of users from application to application, especially between the chatrooms available on each of our products. We also anticipate seeing an increase in users' awareness of the multiple products and services provided by the Yalla Group, which will as a whole, lead to a larger user base, longer time spent in Yalla's ecosystem and deeper brand loyalty in the long run. We recently tested the effectiveness of advertising Yalla on Yalla Ludo in a few regions, and the resulting traffic gain for Yalla was solid. While we have observed good potential for cross-selling on Yalla Ludo, before we decide to launch this project officially we plan to run more trials: essentially, we will test the concept in a few countries first, progressively apply it to all other countries that we operate in, and potentially replicate the same process to help promote our upcoming new products, or even collaborate with other apps in the future. Another exciting update we would love to share with you and our investors here is about our new product, Yalla Parchis. As UAE's first technology unicorn listed on the NYSE, besides focusing on serving our MENA users' needs in the internet era, Yalla is also exploring overseas opportunities in the South American market. Our first product customized for South America, Parchis, has received very good user feedback in its beta trial, and we are very encouraged by its user metrices that we are constantly evaluating. We will keep monitoring the trend, and will share more updates of Parchis' development with you next time. Yalla will continue to leverage the teams' deep local insights to provide MENA local users with various products tailored to their needs and preferences, as it remains dedicated to building and developing the Yalla ecosystem. Our mission is to become the No.1 provider for online social networking and entertainment in the MENA region, and we are well on our way to achieve it. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Karen, who will discuss our key financial and operational results.
Karen Hu: Thank you, Saifi. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our strong performance sustained into the first quarter, as we steadfastly executed our growth strategy that prioritizes user experience and the community development. Our first quarter revenues grew by 221% year-over-year to $67.6 million while our non-GAAP net income reached $33.6 million with a growth rate of 263.7% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP net margin remained elevated at 49.7%, reflecting our unique monetization strategy, market positioning and strong operating efficiency. Now I would like to walk through our financial details for the first quarter of 2021. Our revenues were $67.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, a 221% increase from $21.1 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by the widening of both Yalla's and Yalla Ludo's user base and the enhancement in Yalla Group's monetization capability. Our average MAUs increased by 206.9% from 6.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 to 18.8 million in the first quarter of 2021. Yalla’s MAUs increased by 81.6 % to 7.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 from 4.0 million in the same period of last year; and Yalla Ludo’s MAUs increased by 445.4% to 11.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 from 2.1 million in the same period of last year. In addition, another primary contributor to our solid revenue growth was the significant increase in the number of paying users, which grew from 1.6 million in the first quarter of 2020 to 5.8 million in the first quarter of 2021. Now let's look at our costs and expenses. Our cost of revenues was $24.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, cost of revenues in the first quarter of 2021 were $22.3 million, a 227.2% increase from $6.8 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commission fees for third-party payment platforms resulting from our expanding business scale. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, other components of cost of revenues as a percentage of our total revenues remained relatively stable at 33% in the first quarter of 2021, compared with 32.3% in the same period in 2020. Our selling and marketing expenses were $8.4 million in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, other components of selling and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were $5.1 million, an 81.7% increase from $2.8 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing promotional expenses as a result of our continued user acquisition efforts.

I guess, that's because we haven’t started standing on ourselves and marketing, yes. So, my question is when do we tend to spend more on sales and marketing for especially for our new products, right? And then when we do that, what was going to be the impact on our net income margin. And then, the second question is about our MAU growth outlook, so last time we talked about 10% to 15% sequential growth for each quarter of this year. So, can management comment on that, any update on that and then how should we think about the MAU outlook for the new products. For example by the end of in this year like what's going to be the user size with new products? Thank you.

And very intense angry with feedback and last Q dynamic. We have just our promotion strategy accordingly and in time to next month the efficiency outstanding. But so that, Yalla the Group I mean use our loops. As we mentioned in the last quarter, we think that in both products and I knew outgrow by change of plans with change to 50% quarter-over-to-quarter in the 2021. And for the new products, MAUs outlook is impacted, that’s found on the user's feedback. And so, the there's very much of team progress. Thank you for your question.
