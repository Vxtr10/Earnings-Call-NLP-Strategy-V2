Jirka Rysavy: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. So we ended 2020 on a very positive note, achieving all our goals, generating positive net income and cash flow for the year while growing revenues over 20%. Revenue for the quarter increased 27% to $18.6 million. Our gross margin increased to 87.1%. We ended the quarter with 728,000 members, representing net adds of $31,000 for the quarter and $129,000 for the year. Even with this growth, we were actually able to reduce our overall expenses even in absolute dollars to $62.8 million from $64.8 million a year ago and as a percentage of revenue to 94% from 119%, partially due to improvement of our gross profit per employee by 37% to $525,000 from $384,000. During the fourth quarter, we generated net income of $300,000 or $0.02 per share, EBITDA of $3.5 million or 18.8% of revenue and cash flow from operation of $4.5 million on 24% of revenue. For the year, we have transitioned to a positive income of $0.5 million or $0.03 per share, which is an $18.7 million improvement from last year loss of $18.2 million or $1 a share. EBITDA improved by $15 million or 22% of revenue to a positive $7.4 million from a loss of $7.6 million. Our lifetime value of the average member also improved to over $320 from $300. Our cash position at the end of the year grew to $12.6 million, a reversing a year so the cash use to an increase to $1.1 million for the year and $3.9 million for the quarter. While these metrics represents all times best for Gaia since we sold the legacy Gaian-branded Yoga products in July 2016 and focus exclusively on building our direct-to-consumer digital offering. We have completed the -- I would call it, final phase of our transition to sustainable pure-play streaming video platform then is able to continue to grow revenue over 20% while growing profitably and growing positive cash flow. Since the sale of the Yoga products since 2016, we have grown revenue at 46% of compounded annual growth rate and members at 38% of CAGR. Same time is improving EBITDA margin from negative 9.0% in 2016 to positive 11% in 2020 and 19% in the fourth quarter. And Paul will now speak more to the results.
Paul Tarell: Revenues for 2020 increased 24% to $66.9 million, with an improvement in gross margins to 87.1%. Net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 27% to $18.6 million, with gross margins also improving to 87.1%. We expect to be able to maintain or gradually improve these margins going forward. We ended the year with 727,600 members, which represent net growth in line with our expectations for the quarter.
Operator:  And first from Roth Capital Partners, we have Darren Aftahi.
Darren Aftahi: Congratulations on the transition and nice quarter. Can you maybe go a little deeper into some of these initiatives you mentioned, Paul, in your prepared remarks in terms of how that drives growth? And then two kind of derivative questions; one, as we start 2021, what are you seeing in terms of mix of new subs coming on an annual rate? And then on the marketing side, I'm just kind of curious, where are you guys seeing good traction other than the channel?
Paul Tarell: Sure. So the three initiatives that I outlined were, one was the premium lab access offering, which is for -- you probably remember, the $299 annual offering that we launched in 2019, but then due to COVID and our inability to have events during the majority of 2020, we didn't really push on that. But now that we're able to start having events, albeit with a smaller audience, we're starting to really focus on pushing that live access $299 premium subscription. So it will really be a revenue catalyst as we intend to build on both the archive of content that we've already filmed and then also having the events coming up and being able to convert members around those events. Second piece was the language expansion. So we launched German, French and Spanish from a site functionality perspective in roughly late 2018, early 2019.
Jirka Rysavy: There was a part also ask about annual take rate. That should -- it's about 25% to 30% of the new members.
Paul Tarell: Yes. It's been hanging in there pretty well. It just depends on what we're promoting in terms of content and messaging on whether people take the monthly or annual at that 25% to 30% range. And then the final pieces he asked where we were seeing traction from a marketing perspective. We're pretty much seeing it across the board. Everything is working pretty well for us. I would say the organic and member-driven and investor-driven referrals are continuing to build nicely. And with the community coming online, we expect that to be able to continue to build.
Darren Aftahi: And just want if I just squeeze one more in. As you think about growth and kind of reaching the profitability goals that you have, would you ever kind of dip in the EBITDA margins now to try and help accelerate growth? Or is it just kind of a steady balance between marketing spend and keeping the growth rate where you want to be?
Paul Tarell: Yes. I think the initiatives that I outlined there are really meant to be investing some of that free cash flow in ways that we don't have to necessarily keep flexing marketing dollars to drive growth. So from the perspective of how 2021 shapes up, it will look pretty similar to how Q4 played out in terms of just managing bottom line and cash flows while really trying to focus on top line revenue growth. At some point, though, the model really going to start to generate more earnings and cash flows, then you can reasonably continue to reinvest and so that will start to drive EBITDA margins higher. So to answer your question, would we dip into it? We have a plan that says we don't need to today to drive the initiatives that we're looking at.
Operator: Moving on from Lake Street Capital Markets, we have Mark Argento.
Mark Argento: Congrats on good quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts or updated thoughts around with the channels that you have currently, how big of an addressable market do you think you have with that content or your current content? And maybe you could just suppose that maybe some of your competitors out there. I know curiosity screen has gone public and is out in the domain and is offering up a nice comp as well for you. But maybe you can talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the TAM, Sub tam for the portfolio as you see it today?
Jirka Rysavy: The addressable market, it's kind of if what we see is kind of confirmed what we were saying four years ago. We should not have a problem 2 million or 5 million, 10 million members, easy -- as a market potential, I mean, getting there a different story, how fast and all the stuff. But it's kind of -- I would say, it's probably somewhere of at 7% of the overall addressable streaming we can potentially go higher because it's increasing as the basic health and transformation growth. Our goal is to stay this pretty unique content rather than going in the market, let's say, of the Hulus and Netflix and stuff. I don't want to recommend on something like curiosity stream. They definitely have a different model as it is, as I would look. And it's more of a -- we really believe in the way how we do it and the negative working capital and a relatively good margin. So as we kind of go there, we have a room. We kind of glad how it went this year. We were kind of actually very positively surprised. What we kind of said two years ago is the transition to profitability. We kind of hit everything plus and so this year, we want to really look at expanding kind of two places, which is later in the year, we launched community and also using building kind of MBAs that are based professional sales organization. And so that will really affect the 2022 growth because we believe we can get to some higher growth rates starting from 2022.
Paul Tarell: Yes. And then in terms of how we think about the current channels, it's -- we're really looking at continuing to refine things at a lower granularity than just those top level channels because we understand from a consumer and an audience demand perspective, we have to be much more granular in how we market it.
Jirka Rysavy: Yes. Actually, first time is just negative working capital, we see that our cash flow is higher as a percentage than the earnings, which was always a go.
Mark Argento: Great. And then just one follow-up quick. In terms of the relationship between revenue growth and subscriber growth, I know you something you feel like you can maintain 20-plus percent revenue growth. What kind of sub growth do you need to maintain that revenue growth? I'm assuming it's something below 20%, but maybe you just talk about the relationship between the two, if you would.
Paul Tarell: Yes. So there's two drivers of the average revenue per user. One is the number of people that we can convert to the $299 million premium offering. And ideally, that is all upsells of existing members. So that's all incremental revenue with no marketing per se attributed to it. And then the second piece is for the -- roughly about 20% of our members that come through our third-party partnerships. Those are at net revenues, so they're less than our stated $11.99 a month. So those two things have offset pretty nicely for 2020, which got us revenue growth generally in line with subscriber growth. So I'd say going forward, that's how I would think about it from a mix perspective, knowing that members will be slightly behind revenue as we build out the live access premium offering.
Jirka Rysavy: But I think for 2021, the members, kind of pretty much what Paul said. It's -- since we increased the prices two years ago, we have More bump to revenues than going forward. So
Operator:  We'll move on to Steven Frankel with Colliers.
Steven Frankel: I think I missed the reported CPA for the quarter. So maybe you could just start there.
Paul Tarell: It was not included in my prepared remarks this time, Steve, but it was -- as I mentioned, we had some headwinds in the advertising market, so it was roughly in the low 80s for Q4.
Steven Frankel: Okay. And post election, has that advertising market change materially? Or are you still seeing those kind of rates today?
Paul Tarell: So I think it was not a factor of the election. That's what made it start sooner in Q4. It was really a function of the amount of spend trying to capture buyer demand going into the holiday season. So we saw that elevated rates go pretty much all the way up until the shipping deadline right before Christmas, before it dissipated. And it has been tending to go back to the historical rates, but not nearly as good as it was in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. So my expectation is that we'll settle somewhere in the at $65 to $75 range on a normalized basis going forward, and we're in line with that right now?
Jirka Rysavy: Yes. I think we have in -- especially April, May, then there was kind of the have it surprised for the market a little bit. So a lot of advertisers pull back because they were quite how to respond. The opposite was before Christmas then everybody kind of maybe because they have a budget left from second third quarter to try to spend it for Christmas. But I would kind of overall say, if you look year ago and during the year as a balance and next year, it's kind of stable. So it's more like what -- how much we want to spend. And also, we have -- as our -- as I mentioned, lifetime value, keep growing, rhetorically have more room, but we so far didn't have to use it. You kind of see that our overall marketing as a percentage of revenue dropped dramatically from 100-plus to 56 and now kind of low 40s. So I think there's definitely the market, I would say, it's relatively stable. It's up to us how we strategically want to gain.
Steven Frankel: Okay. And on the international front, what percent of your -- is your installed base today on international? And is there consumption in line with domestic subscribers? Or do you need to flesh out more content to kind of get equivalent consumption rates?
Jirka Rysavy: So the international members right now are kind of, let's call it, low 30%. It depends how -- if you're kind of talking overall users around the world. So we kind of look at it on that basis, but also how many people use, like other languages primarily because there's definitely some people who, let's say, Germany, they're subscribers before we get German offering in German, right? So we're separating those two. The usage, like, for example, usage and the kind of what we call attention, it's about same in Germany that would be in the U.S, if you kind of look Spanish, it's very different. If you look at Spanish speaking, European like Spain compared to like Argentina. So it's very, very different. So I think you have to then look by country rather than the language. So the answer will be much more complex if we try to average stuff. But generally, people countries, they have more developed the kind of credit card markets and get used to it. The numbers ever similar once you go to South America, things get more complex.
Steven Frankel: The payment mechanisms there in the future?
Paul Tarell: Yes. So that's one of the reasons that we swapped out in 2019, our homegrown billing and transaction processing engine into an enterprise-grade solution so that we can start to onboard these new partners from a payment perspective as we expand geographically. So that's one of the areas that we'll be looking to expand on in 2021, getting more geographically relevant payment options now that the infrastructure is in place to be able to support that.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session portion of the call. I'd now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rysavy for any additional or closing remarks.
Jirka Rysavy: Well, thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining, and we look forward to speak with you when we will report the first quarter of this year, which should be in early May. Thank you very much.
Operator: All right. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our call today is for today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We do appreciate your participation."
