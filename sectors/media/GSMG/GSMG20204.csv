Despite the outbreak of COVID-19 and macroeconomic challenges, the government's effective control of epidemic has led to a strong economic recovery in China. As a result of the macroeconomic turnaround and our business resiliency, the sum total of the second, third and fourth quarter revenues in 2020 were higher than our total revenues for the full year of 2019.

We achieved that outperformance by executing our visionary strategy during the period. For example, we developed a series of products in-house to further extend their use cases and refined our user experiences. We also accelerate our efforts to forge more partnerships with leading platforms to further enhance our use to value proposition and diversify our revenue stream.

Going forward, to fuel our growth momentum, we will continue to refine user experiences, expand product use cases and cover new consumption through quality content offerings and enhance user stickiness by introducing more proprietary technology products and establishing more collaboration with other leading businesses. Now turning to our business update. During 2020, to broaden the range of our product use cases, we continued to invest in research and development, upgrade our products and enrich our catalog of high-quality content offering. As such, we unlocked a wider variety of product use cases for our users and thus enabled them to more easily access our premium shopping, live streaming, media and game content.

Before explaining our financial details, please note, our numbers are in U.S. dollar terms unless otherwise stated.

By breaking these numbers down, revenues from our CHEERS App, the Internet business, increased by 195.3% year-over-year to $83.6 million, accounting for 67.5% of our total revenues.

At the same time, CHEERS e-Mall market service revenue grew by 126.4% year-over-year to $1.5 million in the full year of 2020. That is mostly because we continue to optimize our service and merchandise offering of our e-Mall platform through cooperation with many business customers as the pandemic led to the restriction of outdoor activities, we meet strong demand for online entertainment and shopping. We also grew our customized content production revenue at 12.1% year-over-year to $10.2 million in the full year of 2020 as our shopping and streaming revenue continues to gain traction.
