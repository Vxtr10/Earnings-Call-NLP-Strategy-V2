Ofer Adler: Thank you, Rob - Good morning and welcome. In the first quarter of 2010 we continued to show strong results. Revenues were $7 million and in line with our stated quarterly guidance, while EBITDA of $3.1 million came in much stronger than we expected. Net profit for the quarter was $2.1 million, or 22 cents a share, with search related revenues accounting for most of this growth. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no new developments or decisions made by Google in the six weeks since our last investor call. And, while it is our understanding that any potential changes in policy will not affect us before the end of the year, it is important for us to proactively prepare for the future. With that, we have begun formulating a diversification strategy to decrease our dependency on one single partner while increasing revenue streams outside of search. Within search, we have signed an agreement with IAC to power the search service provided to our HiYo users, which we expect to implement shortly. Additionally, we have begun discussions with other search companies to further explore ways to diversify our search generated revenues. We expect to be able to share more details regarding these discussions, as well as an update on our affiliation with Google within the next couple of months. Outside of search we have also accelerated our activity to increase our sources of revenues going forward. We have enhanced the graphic content and design for our IncrediMail product, offering new photo greetings. In addition, as you may recall we introduced a new product called PhotoMail Maker at the end of 2009. This product has been well received by our users, and the product now works with Facebook and Flickr, so that adding your personal photos to enhance and personalize your emails just became even easier and part of the social media experience. Tapping into world of social media opens a door for us in to a growing market that could offer many opportunities beyond Search. We continue to explore and engage other web based affiliates and advertisers to find alternative ways to monetize our user base. Our goal is to grow premium product sales and affiliate revenues so they account for a larger percentage of our revenues by the end of 2010. On April 14th we announced a 43 cent dividend for the second half of 2009, and set May 11th as the date for distributing that dividend. As we complete this distribution, we have effectively distributed almost all our 2009 profits in dividends and we intend to continue our dividend policy in 2010, with our commitment to distribute at least 50% of our profits as dividends. That is my brief business analysis of our last quarter. I would now like to turn the call over to Yacov Kaufman for a financial review of this past quarter and then I will return with some closing remarks before starting Q&A. Yacov...
Yacov Kaufman: Thank you Ofer. Allow me to briefly summarize some of our financial highlights from the first quarter of 2010. Revenue in the first quarter of 2010 rose 10% to $7 million, up from $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2009. This growth in revenues was coupled with an increase in our gross profit margin, from 94% in the first quarter of 2009, to 95% in the first quarter of 2010. So that gross profits increased 11%, from just below $6 million in the first quarter of 2009, to more than $6.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. While operating expenses were lower than last quarter, they increased 9% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the first quarter of 2009, primarily due the higher level of compensation since the end of last year. EBITDA in the first quarter of 2010 was $3.1 million, increasing 7%, compared to $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2009. Net profit in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.1 million, or 22 cents a share, increasing 48%, compared to $1.4 million or 15 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2009. As Ofer indicated, although we have limited visibility, we expect the performance in the second quarter to be similar to that of the first quarter. That is a breakdown of our financials; I would now like to turn the call back over to Ofer for closing remarks. Ofer......
Ofer Adler: Before I open the call to questions, allow me to summarize...... Although we still lack clarity regarding any decisions Google may make, or their timing, if at all, we have begun planning our strategy for the second half of 2010 and beyond. We are focused on diversifying our revenue sources to maximize long-term growth. To do this we have beefed up our efforts to negotiate contracts and find new affiliations to monetize our user base. We have enhanced our existing product line and will look to expand our offerings to increase our premium product sales and grow our user base. We expect to attain more clarity within the next couple of months and to maintain maximum transparency and continue to share the information and developments with investors. Our goals are to maintain a high level or profitability while diversifying our business and offering more visibility moving forward. With that, I now open the call to questions."
