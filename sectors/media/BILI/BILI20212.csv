I will now provide a brief overview of our financial results for the second quarter of 2021 and the outlook for the third quarter. Total net revenue for the second quarter was RMB 4.5 billion, up 72% from the same period of 2020.  We continue to see a more balanced revenue mix driven by our diversified commercialization channels. Our total net revenues, for example -- revenue streams were approximately 27% mobile games, 36% , 23% advertising, and 40% e-commerce and other business. Cost of revenues increased by 74% year-over-year to RMB 3.5 billion. Revenue  costs, a key component of cost of revenues were RMB 1.7 billion, representing a 70% increase from the same period in 2020. Gross profit increased by 64% year-over-year to RMB 989 million, and our gross margin was 22% in the second quarter.  Total operating expenses were RMB 2.5 billion up 170% on the same period in 2020. Selling and marketing expenses were RMB 1.4 billion, representing a 107% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributed to increased channel and marketing expenses to promote our app and , as well as promotional expenses for mobile games and an increasing headcount in sales and marketing personnel.  G&A expenses were RMB 436 million, representing a 109% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in general and administrative personnel, increased share-based compensation expenses, and higher rental expenses. R&D expenses were R&D 600, 74 million, representing a 104% increase year-over-year.  The increase was primarily due to increased economic research and development personnel. And an increase in the share-based compensation expenses. Net loss was RMB 1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2021 compared with RMB 571 million in the same period of 2020.  Adjusted net loss, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses, amortization expenses, income tax  intangible assets across the business acquisition was RMB 858 million compared with RMB 476 million in the same period of 2020.  The basic and diluted net loss per share was RMB 2.91. Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share was RMB 2.23. As of June 30, 2021, we had a cash-of-cash equivalent, hand deposit, as well as short-term investments of RMB 27.6 billion compared with RMB 12.8 billion as of December 31, 2020.  Our sufficient cash reserve gives us more confidence in our ability to execute our growth strategy, which we believe were yields  return in the long run. With that in mind, we are currently projecting net revenue for the third quarter of 2021 to be between RMB 5.1 billion and RMB 5.2 billion. Thank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: . Please note there might be a slight pause as we collate the Q&A roster.  For the benefit of all participants on today's call, if you wish to ask the question to management in Chinese, please immediately repeat your question in English. Please limit your questions to one at a time.  If you wish to have follow-up questions, please rejoin the queue. Once again, it is star 1 to ask the question. We have the first question this is coming from the line of Lei Zhang from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Lei Zhang:  Thanks, management, for taking my question, and congrats on a strong set of results. My question is mainly on user growth. Can you give us more color on the second quarter's user growth, which is typically a low season, but our growth number was pretty good? Then secondly, how should we look at the second half user trend and our long-term user target? Thank you.
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: In the first-half performance we did a pretty good job. I think that's all thanks to our content ecosystem-driven business model. And this model's character is the long term it's evolved, we think the more competitive it is because this is a truly healthy business model that's self-driven and sustainable.   So I believe many of the participants for today's call is Bilibili user itself. And I will be, you might have the same feeling as I do while using Bilibili, that the content on Bilibili is more and more diversified and more high-quality.  Sometimes for my personal use on Bilibili, I will be surprised to find out the diversity, the varsity, and depth of our content offerings. So I believe the business model that we're running is very, very healthy, and we believe this model  our long-term sustainable growth.
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: As for our long-term user guidance, currently, we have already experienced half of the Q3, so far what we have observed in Q3, that we see very good progress in terms of user growth for both quality and quantity.  And early this year, we have given out a user forecast for this year that our MAU will reach 260 million. So far, we think, we should be quite a on track to deliver and achieve that goal or even surpass that goal.  For our long-term goal of 400 million MAU by end of 2023, we -- so far, feel very confident to achieve that goal. We're on track.
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: And one thing I want to emphasize is that Bilibili's user growth, the best of is its quality, that we have maintained a very high quality of user growth. From our perspective, we're not only just attracting users to join Bilibili, but they actually really recognize the value of the platform and they're willing to stay with us for the long term.  Even though that we have experienced a very fast, healthy user growth in the past, we've noticed that engagement level and the activeness of our users still growing, that in the second quarter our daily user time spend reached 81 minutes, that is the best results we've seen compared with our previous second-quarter time spend...
Alex Poon: 
Juliet Yang: And additionally, we see the long-term engagement level for our users is also improving. Actually, we've seen that the registered users in 2018, '19, 2020, the DAU to MAU engagement level in 2021 as actually improving on a year-on-year basis.
Alex Poon: 
Juliet Yang: In every quarter, we release our daily  and our monthly user engagement number, and that year-on-year growth rate is actually faster than our MAU growth rate.
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: So all of those metrics show that we'll not only be able to attract users to join our platform, they actually stay with us and become more engaged.
Rui Chen: Okay.
Lei Zhang: 
Juliet Yang: Thank you.
Operator: We have the next question which is coming from Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Alex Poon:  I will translate my question. My question is regarding the advertising business. Congrats on a very strong growth of over 200% for 2 quarters. Given that there are recently regulations around data privacy, flat-screen ads, education, etc. How should we forecast and look at the second-half growth? Where will the growth drivers come from? Thank you very much.
Lei Zhang: 
Juliet Yang: So for the second quarter, our quarter ad revenue has surpassed 1 billion for the first time, and achieving 200 -- over 200% year-on-year growth, and this is the ninth consecutive quarter that we deliver each advertisement results.
Carly Li: 
Juliet Yang: As we look into the second half and for the next few years, we've done several things to continue to improve our ad efficiencies and lay a solid foundation for our future ad growth.
Carly Li: 
Juliet Yang: So first of all, we have continued to explore multiple scenarios for our ad products based on our client's needs. And we hope to help our clients precisely reach their target audiences multiple times across various scenarios across Bilibili's product ecosystem and quickly view their brand image through just 1 campaign investment. And we have that -- already achieved that all within this quarter.
Lei Zhang: 
Juliet Yang: So secondly, we are also actively exploring new ad formats, including an ad in the video format, as well as connect advertising with content creators' creativity. In the regulatory environment you mentioned, we believe that the foundation or the logic behind it is that the regulatory hope our consumer will be notified it is an advertisement.  And what Bilibili has been practicing is, first of all, we -- all of our advertisements will not be a blockage type of advertisement. We hope really to embed and connect and combine content with an advertisement, make it more interchangeable.  Good content could be a good commercial and a good commercial could be good content. And from that perspective, our integrated marketing solution, as well as our content creator's own creation, their own production towards native ads is a perfect solution to our problem.
Lei Zhang: 
Juliet Yang: And secondly. Our ad efficiency was also greatly improving in this quarter thanks to our ad - tech and our NGL team. And we're also investing in frontier ad-tech-related R&D.
Carly Li: 
Juliet Yang: And thirdly is that we will be focusing on our leading verticals and provide industry-based solutions such as a game, technology, education, e-commerce, and food and beverage, etc. And as we stand to -- expand our user base, we hope to further expand our new ad vertical -- industry verticals and verticals with sufficient ad budget for example, such as automotive and new domestic consumer goods, and all of that has been reflected in our second quarter's app performances.
Carly Li: 
Juliet Yang: And most importantly, we have upgraded the organizational structure of our commercialization team. And that second quarter we have integrated the Bilibili commercialization net where the platform consists of commercial traffic management systems, ads systems, and our Sparkle advertisement system. The purpose of doing so is to further optimize and allocate Bilibili 's commercial resources and improve our commercialization efficiency. And additionally, we have also regrouped. We grouped our sales from the integrated marketing team and our content creator-related sales team, forming 1 centralized sales center. The goal is to provide Bilibili featured integrated marketing solutions and help our clients to improve their brand equity and achieve self-reinforcing marketing circulations on Bilibili.
Carly Li: 
Juliet Yang: So there's a thing that the platform's value equals the user's value on this platform and we --- and Mr. Chen has repeatedly mentioned the value of the user. Our current average age of our users is around 22.8 years old and 60 -- 86% of our users are under age 35 and the majority of them are in first and second-tier cities.  And for this group of cohort main consumption groups for in China, and they represent the highest value of demographic. And building on that advantage, we'll continue to reinforce our infrastructure and continue to improve our ad profit. And for the second half of this year and 1 to 3 years ahead, we're still quite confident to maintain healthy and fast growth for our ad business.
Carly Li: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JP Morgan, please go ahead.
Alex Yao:  So my question is about what the regulatory team has on theming and the live streaming operation. Given the changing regulatory environments in the space, and potentially more quality coming out in the next couple of quarters. How should we think about the impact on our gaming and the live streaming operation? Thank you.
Alex Poon: 
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: Actually for 2021 what we have observed, there's no significant change of the regulatory environment towards games or towards live broadcasting. The speculation and discussion that's all over the internet are just based on the media. It came from the immediate level. And the Company ourselves, we have kept a regular dialogue with different government authorities.  And from the Company's perspective, we're actually haven't heard anything here. And the discussion is generally from the media or the Internet users, and it's just based on their own speculation s or imaginations, and there's no ground to those discussions.  And from our perspective, we think that from a global perspective, the regulation towards internet content game or live broadcasting, it will be more standardize and rule-based. And that hasn't changed.
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: From our perspective, in the past, Bilibili has always responded very actively towards just all kinds of regulations from the government. We believe our industry that's experiencing fast growth, certain regulation is actually beneficiary for this industry's long-term and healthy growth.
Rui Chen: 
Alex Poon: 
Juliet Yang: So we think as the industry's development, as they have more influence and impact towards the society, it's a very natural process for the regulations could become more rule-based and standardized.  And I believe the video industry, will be a multi-billion -- trillion of RMB worth of industry, and games probably will become -- they will very likely to become the mainstream format of entertainment. And in the past it's probably is an emerging new vertical.  And the details of those regulations were not mature, and as you grow bigger, it's just very natural for the regular tree to form up of a more standardized and rule-based regulatory environment.
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: So we think that the government's regulation towards video content and game content has been very clear. And in general, they do hope this industry will develop and they encourage the development of this industry and they have been very specific on the same side and hope to regulate.  One is on the minor protection, 2 is the compliance of the content itself. And in the past and up to now, Bilibili has been very clear on those requirements and has followed an implementation, all the regulatory requirements
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: So generally, I think that the game industry will definitely move forward and experience better development. And as an Internet Company, we'll be fully compliant with the key areas that the government has specifically required.  One is on the minor protection, and 2 is on the compliance of the content itself. My personal view is still very optimistic. I believe that this industry will only become better and better under the supervision of the government
Rui Chen: 
Alex Poon: 
Juliet Yang: Generally, I think that this industry is quite different from 10 years ago. Probably, in 10 years ago, it's  early stage, there is not a very precisely regulated. But 10 years later, this industry has become much more mature. The participants in this industry also gained more experience over ten years of experience.  I think we have already reached a consensus, the industry players and the regulatory is that the industry needs to be regulated towards a healthy development path, and from Bilibili's perspective we have strictly followed the rules. For example, on the Minor Protections, the revenue generated from users that's below 18 years old the game revenue only takes around 1% of our total game revenue.  We have been implementing restrictions and rules to better protect our minors and follow the regulator's requirements. So I think the overall industry is growing towards a more healthy and positive track. And I personally feel quite comfortable with the existing environment.
Alex Poon: 
Juliet Yang: To summarize, in the past few months, I personally don't believe there's a vast change of regulatory environment towards games or video. And we believe the regulatory -- the existing practice and requirement from the government are very appropriate and scientific.  And we believe our peers in this industry also agree with that and already reached a consensus that this industry needs to be moved towards a more healthy and regulated path.
Operator: Okay. The next question comes from the line of Felix Yu from UBS, please go ahead.
Felix Yu:  Let me translate myself. So first, congratulations on the strong set of results. My question is on the GP margin. I notice the GP margin this quarter was -- showed some weakness Q-on-Q and year-on-year. So may I know the reason or any color behind that? And what are the management's thoughts on the GP margin trend for the rest of this year, and towards the longer-term potential? Thank you.
Xin Fan: This is Sam (ph). Let me take your question. You're right. A slight decrease of the margin in Q2. Actually, it's mainly due to the change in the sales mix. In Q2, we thought the contribution of game revenue actually was decreased as a percentage of the whole revenue. And there was also a lower contribution from our core operation gains.  And also for our live broadcasting revenue, the gross profit margin also declined a little bit due to -- because we launched a campaigning Q2 to offer higher revenue -channel ratio, it's like a performance-based incentive and -- for those new hosts . Actually, if you look at short-term GP margin trends, we are still in the early stage on the monetization side, so it will be  over the quarter.  But before we get into the details of our long-term margin trend, I would like to emphasize the way we -- the strategic thinking  for facility and why we have the opportunity to quickly extend our user base or pirated always focused on user growth and top-line station, rather than to limit our growth potential. For the sake of the break-even.  When we're thinking about the past to the profitability, actually we're thinking what the center bowl, revenue level to achieve a healthy break-even status. And whether it's simple to keep improving the possibility after the break-even. So, for example, a Company with like RMB 20 billion revenue and the same Company with RMB 15 billion revenue, the bigger revenue side is sure, more sustainable for long-term development.  Over the past 12 months here, actually, we successfully achieved quality revenue growth with the expansion of our user base. Our MAUs were up 38% year-over-year, and monetization efficiency per MAU was also increasing, especially, the  revenue per MAU actually increased by 72% year-on-year to around 13.8 RMB per quarter in Q2.  Yet we believe there is plenty of upsides because we grow our user base and improve our monetization efficiency. And also on the costs side, our key relatively fixed operating costs, including the content, server, and staff costs, decreased from 34% of the total revenue in 2019 to 28% in Q2 this year.  As we grow our top-line and improve efficiency, our revenue mix will also be more diversified, and our segment margin, which is live broadcasting and online games, as I mentioned, does have room to improve. That's the way you want to look at the long-term gross profit margin trends.
Felix Yu: Thank you. And that makes sense. Very clear.
Operator: Thank you. We have the next question from Lee Wen Zhang. Please go ahead
Lee Wen Zhang:  So my question is regarding . So in the first half-hour, can you remain pretty stable? How should we go? Okay. I've costs and also for longer-term gaming revenue growth additional late where way to the self-developed game. What're key factors we need to have in mind. Thank you.
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: Indeed, when we look at our game revenue we have experienced some of the slowdowns in the first half of this year. The main reason that we see is the lack of supply for both of our exclusively licensed games and jointly-operated games for the revenue to grow we need to connect to -- we need to get more new games.  And because of the overall permit issue process, in the past 6 months, that there has been some delay and the supply has been slower than expected. And for the same reason, some of our projects have been delayed, and that was the main reason for the  for our game revenues.
Rui Chen: 
Juliet Yang: We've also seen some positive signs as we operate our business. Besides the supply issue, we've seen on the demand side, there are many, many positive signs. First of all, on the user.  The game-related user who watch game-related live broadcasting and video actually kept growing with our overall MAU s, even with the undersupply for game titles, for all the -- for many new titles that we used in the first half of this year, including Guardian Tales and Sword Art Online.  It's a new addition. New downloads and new users have constantly broken our single-game record. And on the other hand, for the old games, we are seeing a long operation cycle. Many of our games continue to grow in terms of revenue and users. For example, our Azur Lane -- our exclusively licensed game, Azur Lane, our jointly operated games gain some impact.  We're seeing more users joining and  continuously to grow year-over-year. So generally, we think on Bilibili the gamers are growing and their desire and need for high-quality games are also growing.

Juliet Yang: As we see it, we think as long as we solve the supply problem, we should be able to solve the bottleneck that we've been seeing in the past quarters. And the solution to the supply problem is, while we continue to enhance our licensing business, we will continue -- we will start to invest in our self-developed games.  And actually, from -- in last year, we've already seen the trend of lots of supply in the market, and we started to invest in the self -developed game business. Currently, we have over 1,000 team members in our self-development team, and there are multiple titles and projects  under development.  And we'll be expecting to launch our own self-developed games next year and the year after next year. From -- based on our existing business scale, we think our self-developed game will be our number one priority. And I believe in a few years later, our self-developed games should be contributing over half of our game revenue
Rui Chen: 
Alex Poon: 
Juliet Yang: And to summarize, we believe as our future continues to expand, we should have more gamers and more demand for games. And to solve the supplier problem will continue to reinforce our licensing. Being in business while investing in self-developed games.  And in the past, we might have one engine for game revenue growth, which is licensing. And in the next few years, we'll be due engine self-development Licensing and operations and we think that should power our game revenue growth.
