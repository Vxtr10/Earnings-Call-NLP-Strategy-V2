She will provide you with our operating metrics in more detail and our financial assessment. Ashley, please go ahead.
Ashley Xin Wu: Thank you Mr. Dong, and hello everyone. Following Mr. Dong's remarks, I will start with an update on our content enrichment and diversification initiatives. E-sport is at the core of our content ecosystem and we have been committed to bring more high-quality and popular E-sport content to game enthusiasts. During the third quarter, we broadcasted 131 third-party E-Sport E - sport prominence, generating total viewership of 590 million. LPL Summer,  World Champion Cup, and LCK Summer were among the most watched events in the third quarter. Our exclusively broadcast comprehensive regional tournament, including national electronic sport tournament and E-sport Championships East Asia were also welcomed by users. Although some key license events were temporarily delayed during the season, we added more professional, comprehensive content in comparison with last year's schedule. In the third quarter, we broadcasted 58 self-produced eSport tournaments and entertainment PGC shows, and total viewership reached 142 million, growing over 40 % year-over-year. Among the eSport tournaments that we produced, the HUYA All-Star Cup, Huya  has become a signature event for PeaceKeeper Elite. In these event's summer season, we invited top professional players and well-known broadcasters from multiple live-streaming platforms in China as well as several international teams to team up and compete, making it especially popular. During this period, we also hosted the  for CrossFire Mobile, CrossFire HD,  and Naraka Bladepoint, all of which further complement the content for those game titles already on the Huya platform gaining even more traction with game lovers.  Notably, our  cup for LoL  held in August quickly attract users’ attention before the formal launch of this much anticipated game. In addition, during the period of HoK World Champion Cup, we produced the complementary program  integrating professional game play analysts with  show. It is the first of its kind for this HoK tournament. We believe it was a success, attaining a viewership of over 12 million during the third quarter. On the entertainment TGC program  our long-standing GodLie Season 6,  a werewolf game show, and Huya Kungfu Carnival Season 5,  a mixed martial arts competition continues to be the top performing show. In September, we introduced Huya Music Pub. Huya Music Pub, , our first music scene invests into real program. This program invites well-known musicians to share their stories, further enriching our pan-entertainment offerings. We continue to strengthen our efforts for videos by encouraging streamers to also become video content creators. In addition to the popular video - on -demand format. The video carries their format  which supports ongoing replace. It's also  on our  as it livestreaming user habits. In the third quarter  reached MAUs, who watch videos on our platform increased to approximately 14 million representing quarter-over-quarter growth of 30 %.  Moving on to our international expansion progress, the average MAUs of Nimo TV, our overseas game live streaming platform, increased to more than 28 million in the third quarter and the overseas revenues are just over 200 % year-over-year growth. The sequential user growth was mainly driven by certain regional E-sport tournaments, particularly in Southeast Asia. As we continue to deepen our relationships with local content providers and game companies, we are also refining our cooperation with local agent  for more sustainable and healthy future revenue growth.  Next, I will walk you through our financial highlights. In the third quarter, our total net revenues were approximately RMB 3 billion, up 6 % year-over-year. Our live-streaming revenue, or RMB 2.6 billion in the quarter. A slight decrease from the same period last year, primarily due to lower average spending per paying user of  Partially offset by the increase in the overseas live streaming revenues, the number of paying users for Huya Live reached 6 million, which is flat compared with the same period last year. Nevertheless, our paying user numbers improved compared with the second quarter and were in line with our mobile MAU expansion trends. The usual low spending from newly active playing users has resulted in a lower ARPPU in the third third quarter. Advertising and other revenues increased by 137 % year-over-year to almost RMB 374 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by revenues from content licensing. Profit levels in the third quarter were impacted as we set up investment in our content. Our non-GAAP gross profit was RMB 516 million non-GAAP gross margin was 70.3%.

Revenue sharing fees and content costs increased by 16.3% to RMB 2.12 billion for Q3, primarily due to the increase in revenue sharing fees in relation to certain broadcaster incentive programs and the increase in spending on E-sport content and content creators. This cost decreased by 14.2% to RMB 178 million for Q3, primarily due to improved  cost management and continued technology enhancement efforts.

Share of income in equity master investments, net of income taxes was RMB 379 million for Q3 compared with RMB 0.2 million for the same period of 2020, primarily attributable to the investment income related to a disposal equity investment.

Rongjie Dong: 
Hanyu Liu: The S11 actually took place last weekend. And we are more than happy to see that this event has caused sensational outcomes in the world of games. And we are very happy to see that another LPL team entered into the final and got the title in the end. And we believe that the influence of this event is expanding.
Thomas Chong: 
Ashley Xin Wu: We're very happy to see that during this whole S11 period, Huya had continued our lead in the market shares.
Thomas Chong: 
Unidentified Company Representative: During this event, Huya had sought a number of new records made for the viewership, especially for PCUs. This year actually is 2 times of that from the last edition and it has also recorded as the highest PCU for Huya platform and its history.
Thomas Chong: 
Ashley Xin Wu: During this tournament, we had launched operational activities together with Tencent and also we launched a mobile game based on the tournament. Both of these activities have delivered very nice results and we will continue to improve our live streaming technologies to optimize the viewer experiences. The penetration rate of Huya and  actually is the highest during the past 3 editions. 
Unidentified Company Representative: Now, Ms. Wu, I will tell -- I will talk about the users and revenue expectations in Q4 and next year. So overall speaking, we expect our users to grow continuously, and despite some seasonality changes, we believe that our investment in the content will help us to grow our viewership. And also we expect some very positive impact from most recent new mobile launch -- new game launches, as well as tournament events.
Ashley Xin Wu: 
Unidentified Company Representative: New games have always been an important source for our users. And winning the title for S11  and also becoming -- for e-sport, becoming an official item in Asian games will both create very positive impact for our viewers and will help us to enter into a wider audience’s population. So for the longer term, we believe that our potential user growth will have -- will continue to increase.
Hanyu Liu: 
Ashley Xin Wu: In terms of revenue, we believe that revenue to some extent is under the impact of the micro environment as well as live streaming sector as a whole. So our target is to keep a higher-than-average growth pace and continue to grow in years to come.
Hanyu Liu: 
Ashley Xin Wu: That's it. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Yiwen Zhang from China Renaissance. Please go ahead.
Yiwen Zhang:   Thanks for taking my question. I have a two-question regarding LoL mobile. Firstly, it's extent -- exactly
Rongjie Dong: one of the intro in game knowledge. Can you share more color on the new users found this title?
Yiwen Zhang: And I guess if we make a reference to  also  what hit that gap between  and user coming into our platform? And then secondly, can you discuss the preparation we made for LoL mobile, including the stream recommend, and also our self-organized tournament. And additionally, how much incremental content cost do you expect to incur? Thank you.
Rongjie Dong: 
Unidentified Company Representative: You're right by saying that LoL mobile was launched about one month ago and Huya platform
Ashley Xin Wu: continued to take this significant market share. And right now the user or viewership performance is better than other games such as PUBG. But of course, we will continue to monitor their performances going forward.
Rongjie Dong: 
Unidentified Company Representative: This LoL Mobile is by no means replacing the users for LoL PC or HoK. Therefore, we have the right confidence of gaining more viewers and users from live-streaming for this mobile game.
Rongjie Dong: 
Unidentified Company Representative: In preparation for the launch of this game, we've done a lot of things in operation. For instance, we had signed some live streamers as well as our working together with talent agencies in preparation for the launch.
Rongjie Dong: 
Unidentified Company Representative: Since the launch, we had organized a number of tournaments and events in order to give opportunities for our live streamers to make their shows and make exposures. We have now assigned over 1,000 streamers and also had signed a number of professional teams.
Rongjie Dong: 
Ashley Xin Wu: Going forward that we would consider acquiring licensed tournaments in China for domestic leagues as well as the other key important tournaments on top of organizing our own tournament events.
Hanyu Liu: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Lei Zhang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. please ask a question.
Lei Zhang: Hi.  Two questions here. First is on margin trend. Can you give us more color on margin trend, especially any change in revenue sharing costs in our content costs. And secondly, wondering your updates on your strategy about e-sports tournament and how should we think about the tournaments-related costs in the future? Thank you.
Ashley Xin Wu: 
Unidentified Company Representative: In order to improve our competitiveness and better serve our users, we had step-up our effort in putting more resources in content since Q3, including by making more investments for our content creators as well as the self-produced, high-quality content, and licensed tournament content as well. In terms of revenue sharing with our live streamers, in order to improve our competitiveness while maintaining the basics of revenue sharing mechanisms unchanged, we will also address and trying to give more incentives for the live streamers according to the market dynamics.
Ashley Xin Wu: 
Unidentified Company Representative: In terms of margin levels, well, there's some seasonality changes according to the scheduling of our operational events as well as the tournaments, especially in Q4  because there are a number of big events towards the end of the year. And also there are some  of events and tournaments such as S11 auto plays in Q4. So that has generated some impact on our tournament costs and also the operation costs with regards to contents.
Rongjie Dong: 
Unidentified Company Representative: So Mr. Dong will take the question with regard to tournament and its IP cost. Please dot E-sport are will continue to be very popular in a few years to
Ashley Xin Wu: come, especially with the S11 final title, as well as Asian games. So we believe that the costs for top tier tournaments will probably go higher in the future.
Rongjie Dong: 
Ashley Xin Wu: On the other hand, for some long tail tournaments or new tournaments really depend on the promotion of live-streaming platforms. So the costs for these kinds of events will probably be quite flattish. On the other hand, we also noticed that self-produced content is also a very important source of content for Huya.
Rongjie Dong: 
Rongjie Dong: 
Unidentified Company Representative: So for self-produced content as well as our own e-sport tournaments or event -- our entertainment events,
Ashley Xin Wu: we believe that this kind of content creates a better value of money and it's quite unique to our platform so we will continue to invest in these areas and we hope to raise the percentage points from the current level to around 10 % to 20 % in years to come.
Hanyu Liu: Okay. Next question, please.
Operator: Next question comes from Ritchie Sun from HSBC. Please go ahead.
Q - Ritchie Sun: 
Ritchie Sun:  So I will translate the questions myself. So firstly, I want to ask about the competitive landscape dynamic. How has that been trending? And without M&A and also ongoing intense competition, how should we think about the long-term net margin level for the platform. Second question is, can you share about the progress made in game video? You mentioned the MAU of 40 million. So what about the user time spend, retention, as well as monetization plan? Thank you.
Rongjie Dong: 
Ashley Xin Wu: Mr. Dong
Unidentified Company Representative: on the question of competition landscape. Well, since we are not joining hands with DouYu and became competitors again, we believe that in recent quarters, the overall competition landscape for a game live streaming does not change a lot. Compared with DouYu, I think we have a much better operational efficiencies and we have outperformed in terms of users, as well as our revenues.
Rongjie Dong:  
Unidentified Company Representative: Even though our peers are making more and more investment in live-streaming for e-sport s, however, we are a professional platform for e-sports and we rely on our core competitiveness and continue to strengthen our positioning in this regard.
Rongjie Dong: 
Ashley Xin Wu: As I said before, we will continue to gain our market share and also to keep strengthening our advantages in live-streaming
Unidentified Company Representative: for e-sport s. And over time, as we are accumulating more and more professional know-hows and experiences in running e-sport s, we would love to have a more diversified business models and by relying on self-produced content, for instance.
Hanyu Liu:  
Ashley Xin Wu: Ms. Wu, on the question of video content production. But actually for videos, the user actually had increased. Since Q3, our MAU reached 40 million compared with the previous quarter of Q2, there is an increase of about 30 %. We believe that video business is a natural extension to the live streaming business that we have. A lot of video content originated from the events, tournaments,
Unidentified Company Representative: basically about editing and reproduction of the live streaming contents. I think one of our biggest advantage in this regard is that we have abundant resources in terms of content origins, and we have a very good ability of editing and reproducing them into videos. In terms of the video content production, we encourage live streamers and talent agencies to make content -- to make a video content. And in terms of the products, we have launched a lot of new features.  For instance, we have this highly efficient editing features and we can use AI technology to identify the key moments and points, and generate our video clips are automatically. So this is a very positive feature that we have for producing content for software videos
Hanyu Liu: We can have the next question. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Bryan Gong from CTP. Ask your question.
Bryan Gong:  I will translate myself. Can management share your latest view on the impact from the regulation of gaming and game live screaming, towards our operations and the fundamentals. And is there any change to our strategies post to the latest regulation. Thank you.
Ashley Xin Wu:  
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you. As you rightly pointed out that in recent months, our industry has received quite a lot of attention from the regulators. And we believe the purpose of doing that is to better regulate the industry and to promote a healthy long-term growth. We've been keeping an eye on the latest regulatory changes and to make sure that our business operation is in full compliance with those regulations.
Ashley Xin Wu: Even though there will be some short-term changes in terms of the revenue or user-based growth because of the regulatory changes for the short-term. But we believe that for the long-term we would be agile enough to mitigate the impact on our business and to actively address our product and operations to make sure that we can cater for the demands of the users and also at the same time be compliant. 
Hanyu Liu: 
Unidentified Company Representative: That said, we will continue to invest in high-quality content production to upgrade our products, as well as to consolidate our competitiveness of the business as a whole. And for the longer-term, we believe that this will help us to better serve our clients and generate long-term value. Thank you.

Our MAU in overseas market reached 28 million. And especially we had a very stellar performance in the market of Indonesia.
