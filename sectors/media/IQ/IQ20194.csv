Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the iQIYI Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I must advise you that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Investor Relations Director of iQIYI, Dahlia Wei. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Dahlia Wei: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone and thank you all for joining iQIYI's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference Call. The company's results were released earlier today and are available on the company's Investor Relations website at ir.iqiyi.com.
Yu Gong: Hello everyone and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and the full year 2019 earnings call. We concluded the year 2019 with a solid ending. Q4 and the full year net revenues reached RMB7.5 billion and RMB29 billion, respectively, backed by the optimized structure of our content costs, which only grew moderately at single-digit percentage on a full year basis. We further solidified our industry-leading position in terms of our user scale, user stickiness, and a number of subscribers. We are pleased with a set of significant progress we made in 2019, including being the first among industry peers to hit the 100 million subscriber milestone, consistently developing innovative original content, pioneering new advertising solutions, and making new breakthroughs in technology development. I'll start my review with our membership business. As of December 31st, 2019, our total subscribers reached 107 million, a net addition of 19.5 million compared to year end 2018. Subscription revenues grew 36% year-over-year to RMB14.4 billion and contributed half of our full year 2019 total revenues. This reflects our dedication in delivering best quality content to our subscribers and our various operating initiatives to expand our subscriber base. In the fourth quarter, the release of a number of highly popular drama series drove subscriber growth, namely Qing Yu Nian, The Listener, Sword Dynasty and Spirit Sword Mountain among others. Typically, drama series have been the main driver of the subscriber growth, but with our portfolio of content expanding, we are beginning to see a wider range of content categories playing an increasingly important role. For example, hit theatrical movies, such as Ne Zha and The Captain, animation serials One Piece, as well as premium variety show, More Than Forever, all helped to drive our subscriber growth.
Xiaodong Wang: Good morning, everyone. Let me go through our financial highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2019, iQIYI total revenues were RMB 7.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year.

Online advertising service revenue in 2019 was RMB 8.3 billion, down 11% year-over-year, primarily due to the macro headwinds, the uncertainty of certain content scheduling and intensified competition in advertising business. Content distribution revenue for the fourth quarter was RMB 878 million, up 68% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and the contractual price of the titles we distributed in the quarter. Content distribution revenue in 2019 was RMB 2.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year, driven by a number of premium content titles that we distributed during the year. Other revenues for the fourth quarter were RMB 874.4 million, down 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the soft performance of certain business lines, partially offset by strong growth in game business.
