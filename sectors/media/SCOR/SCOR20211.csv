"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to comScore's First Quarter 2021 Financial Results. At this time, all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised, that todayâ€™s conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jackie Marcus. Please go ahead.
Jackie Marcus: Thank you, Elaine. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include comments about our plans, expectations and prospects and are based on our view as of today, May 6, 2021. We disclaim any duty or obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information after today's call.
Bill Livek: Thank you, Jackie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. The completion of the recapitalization transaction in the first quarter, whilst the process to a close, substantially eliminated in our outstanding debt and providing us with the financial flexibility to invest in next generation products. And we are doing just that, comScore's capitalizing on the opportunity to help the media business both the traditional and the new direct-to-consumer platforms to more effectively use comScore service to run their business, acquire new customers and to sell their advertising. We believe that we have the best information needed to jump to a forefront of video measurement in the industry in digital and television and moving measurement. Because our core services are census based not on a small sample that lacks stability. Our results are stable, predictable and reliable. In comScore's approach to cross platform measurement, we leverage intelligence from various data collection techniques, including our digital census, our set-top box devices, our smart TV data and our panels. Each of these sources provide different information about content consumption and advertising exposure. Our measurement philosophy is always to bring the best available information to bear on each process within our overall measurement solutions. Our expertise in processing these inputs coupled with our IT, we arrive at a de-duplicated audience measurement across the sources. This is foundational to our product strategy and in my opinion it's the best approach to measurement. Additionally, we are taking action to enter new markets that I'll be sharing with you on future calls. We are also recapturing customers given our substantially more advanced, privacy-focused solutions. And we are posed to take market share in areas that we provide a stronger service versus others. We also look at our valuation of some of our competitors. We believe that our potential to deliver improvements in both our revenue and our bottom line has not been fully appreciated and in fact expect. We expect that to change during the course of 2021 and beyond.
Greg Fink:
Operator:  And your first question comes from Dan Medina from Needham.
Dan Medina: Good morning Greg. Thanks for taking the question. Just given where the first quarter came out, I was wondering if you can discuss how we might think of revenue growth cadence over the next three quarters and what will be the key growth drivers in each quarter? Thank you.
Greg Fink: Thanks Dan. I appreciate the question. Look, we're really pleased where first quarter came out and we're very optimistic about the back half of 2021let me start there. And while we haven't provided specifics regarding the 2021 quarters, we are very focused on revenue growth and continue to believe it's going to be in the back half of 2021 as we have outlined in our guidance to achieve the 3% to 5%. Bill outlined many different products and things that have occurred over the last four months to start out 2021 and as those now are signed and in in-process, we expect those to generate revenue in the back half. Well, I haven't given specifics around quarters; we do continue to believe that we will see improving quarters throughout all of 2021.
Dan Medina: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And now I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Livek for closing remarks.
Bill Livek: Thank you operator. We remain excited about the future and we'll continue to see the progress as it evolves through 2021. We look forward to sharing with you the progress on our next quarterly call and with press releases in the interim. And thank you for joining us today and trusting us with some of your investment dollars. Thank you and have a great evening.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
