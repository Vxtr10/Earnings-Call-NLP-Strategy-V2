In particular, our coverage of this event was well received by our users achieving 15.3 million views in total.

We also achieved improvement in other operating metrics including user conversion rates retention rate and user time spend our flagship news app iPhone. Notably, our consistent coverage of this high profile social event continues to boost both our market leadership and brand influence in China's new media industry.In addition to premium news coverage, we also continue to enhance our brand influence and solidify our leadership in key content verticals to offline events in the quarter.

Golf Player is a highly anticipated game title produced by our subsidiary in 2019. We're convinced that our commitment to developing creative IP and new channels of monetization will enable us to continue growing our traffic and diversify our revenue stream in the long run. By the end of 2019, we have cash and cash equivalents of around US $243 million and we are expecting to receive about US $200 million from the second payment charge of our Yidian transaction.On acquisition front, while we remain certain of our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets and capitalize on these opportunities, we will continue to exercise the prudent approach with due diligence in order to maximize our upside potential. With abundant cash reserves, healthy cash flows and systematic strategy investments, we firmly believe in the strength of our long-term growth prospects. Looking back, on 2019, we experience the challenges of involving media regulations and macroeconomic head points. However, despite these effects obstacles, we continue to enhance users' stickiness by in reaching our content library, bolster our brand influence in key continent verticals and explore additional monetization opportunities, as well as advance into 2020; we are facing unprecedented challenges from one of the most devastating epidemics of era. It's coronavirus outbreak. We always pride ourselves, our ability to deliver premium reporting to our audience. In response, we have once again set ourselves apart from our media and internet portal peers by launching various reporting initiatives to lead outbreak coverage.At onset, we launched the first-ever climatic as well as international epidemic map to track the spread of virus in real time. Document confirmed cases and categorize cases by chronology and geography. We also created the first special media column dedicated to fact-checking and debunking outbreak rumors, while producing daily briefings on a latest outbreak press, keep our users informed. Furthermore, we let the first internet wide campaign to fight the surge of resentment and discrimination towards those at outbreak's epicenter in Wuhan, successfully promoting a thorough understanding of the situation. To heighten public awareness, we leverage our ability to process, analyze and deliver informative and engaging new content since January 19, We-media account human intelligence Agency, [Indiscernible] has issue over 30 in-depth analysis pieces on outbreak development helping to educate the public on origin and transmission mechanism of virus, while demystifying outbreak rumors.The exclusive coverage of all We-media account global has also received industry-wide recognition cracking over 14 million views on our platform and producing multiple articles that have topped the charts of other social media platforms. Additionally, we publish a number of pieces on ordinary Chinese citizens bravely battling against the disease to maintain a sense of normality in their lives on popular We-media account. Living [Indiscernible]. These stories receive 5 million views on platforms with the most public collecting one in 50 million views across Internet, notably our success in these initiatives continue to illustrate our competitive advantages in professional reporting talent, powerful brand influence and a global journalist team which is second to none.For our internal operations, we immediately acted to protect the health and well-being of our employees and maintain efficient daily operations. Moreover in line with our commitment to social responsibility, we provided additional forms of aid beyond our premium news coverage. For example, we were part of the first batch of Internet companies to donate RMB1 million to the China Charity Federation in support of those medical workers on the front lines of the outbreak. We're also among early donor of education equipment to help students is less developed areas, a course online learning courses.To better facilitate the public access to medical assistance, we establish platform to provide counseling services to those in need of mental health support and an online registry for those who suspect that they may be infected and are under self-imposed quarantine. Our response to the outbreak has not only received a positive reception from the public but has also helped to further augment our brand influence and credibility. To date, we have remained at the forefront of the domestic reading in terms of breaking news and quality of content.Going forward, we'll continue to focus on providing our audience with the premium news coverage that it requires in such times of crisis. In the coming quarter, we believe that most domestic companies will inevitably be forced to reach and evaluate their marketing strategies and revise their advertising budgets such as shift will negatively impact our advertising revenues in the near term. However, as I have mentioned, our ability to generate highly relevant sales leads will remain attracted to those advertisers, while focus are maximizing their ad ROI while operating under budgetary constraints. Therefore, we expect the epidemic to impact our business segments in the short term. However, our consistent delivery of premium new content and elevated brand influence will help to ensure the growth prospects about advertisement business in the long term.With that I'll turn the call to Edward, our CFO to go through the financial details.

We are now ready for questions. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]Your first question comes from the line of Frank Chen. Please ask your questions.
FrankChen: Hello, Shuang, Edward, Qing. Hope everyone is healthy. I have a question on the loss margin in 2020. I remember last time you were talking about to lower the loss by like 50% in 2020. Given current situation, can you give some update on your target? How should we think of the loss and loss margin in 2020? Thank you.
ShuangLiu: Yes. Hi. This is Shuang. I like to answer your question maybe Edward can add few more words. We believe that we can significantly narrowing our loss in 2020. First at the end of the 2019, we thoroughly refine our organization structure and also things at the start of 2020 also systematically optimize our content cost and traffic acquisition cost to control our content cost we review all the contracts with our content providers more carefully before planning it so that we can maximize our return, our investments of all copyright contents. To control our channel cost, we have taken into consideration both the current market environment, user growth strategies, implemented a series of serious cost control measures and limited power manage into those channels with less efficient traffic acquisition.Moreover, I think the outbreak of our operating metrics have improved substantially as a result our conviction towards maintaining our professional journalism and augmenting our brand influence is further strengthened as these core competencies enable us to attract those users with profiles desirable by our advertising clients. We believe we're able to improve our profitability in an efficient manner. So we remain confident in our ability to narrow losses substantially in 2020.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carmen Zhang from First Shanghai. Please ask your question.
CarmenZhang: Hi, management. Thanks for taking my question. My question is about the recent coronavirus outbreak. Could management share your thoughts on how the outbreak may impact your business?
ShuangLiu: This is Shuang. Yes. I will tackle the question first and maybe later Edward can cover the impact on our advertising business and other relatable. I think the early stage of the coronavirus outbreak; our editorial team has provided comprehensive and in-depth coverage of epidemic. Our reporting performance have in turn significantly enhance our operating metrics including DAU retention rate and click-through rate our iPhone news app. In addition, our well received news coverage also helped us further enhance our brand reputation. So this outbreak provides us with an opportunity to further strengthen our brand influence and improve our traffic. We also like that outbreak coverage rates by leveraging Phoenix satellite television news reporting resources providing original video programs producing in-depth expert opinions and distributing real time epidemic data. Beyond our news coverage we also provide various type of aid to support those affected by the coronavirus, including as I mentioned in my opening remarks, including the donation of cash and medical supplies to Hubei province. We initiated several influential social campaigns. For example, we established China's first online registry for coronavirus patients; offer tablets to children in poverty so they can access online classes and publish an encyclopedia of protective measures in collaboration with Providence Academy for overseas Chinese students.These initiatives not only provided tangible support to those affected by the epidemic, but also enhance our branding reputation which will improve our brand advertising sales in the future. Based on these our recent practice, the industry-leading quality of our news coverage has attracted many new users to our platform with a healthy level of click-through rate and user time spent. So going forward we, I think we will continue to focus on the needs of those core users as we optimize our content ecosystem and AI powered content distribution system. So with this strategic focus in mind, we have -- we evaluated our user acquisition strategy as well. We think when we examine the ROI of those users acquired through our investment in marketing channels, we figure out that their level of stickiness and engagement, as well as their contribution to our ad inventory still has quite a bit of room to optimize.So we believe that in 2020 our traffic acquisition cost should be reduced by at least 50% as we improve our user acquisition efficiencies. So this epidemic also let us realize that we need to re-evaluate and without new user growth strategy to optimize our user experience. While we are expecting user traffic to gradually return to normal levels after the epidemic, the outstanding quality of our news coverage during the outbreak has allowed us to further enhance our users' stickiness and brand influence. These improvements will remain attractive for our brand advertising clients after epidemic is contained. Edward probably could have few more words on advertising and other business.
EdwardLu: Sure. Thank you, Shuang. Good morning, Carmen. This is Edward speaking. I'd like to talk to about the impact of coronavirus outbreak on our advertising business. Actually the competition the online advertising market has become increasingly fierce in recent years. Top short-form video platforms are gaining an increasing amount of market share and the user time spend as people have spent more time on lines throughout the coronavirus outbreak, we have observed an increase in the overall supply of advertising inventory. However, at the same time the epidemic is impacting advertisers business as well and causing them to be more conservative about your ad placement and the marketing spending.From our perspective, the combination of these factors has created downward pressure on the pricing of our advertisement for sure, especially on the ECPM of performance-based as from SME. During the outbreak, our excellent reporting of the epidemic has resulted in a significant increase in user traffic. This improvement enabled us to effectively increase our advertising inventory and the sales. However, in general overall advertising environment well create a serious challenge for our advertising business in 2020 especially on the brand advertising sales side.Take the auto industry as an example. Due to the impact of the epidemic, consumer demand for cars has dropped significantly. According to recent data released by the China Association of automobile manufacturers, auto sales in the first of the two months of 2020 decreased by 42% in comparison to the same period of 2019. As a result of these, carmakers in China yet to be forced to add or reduce their marketing budgets or delay their marketing plan. However, it is expected that the market will start to recover in the second quarter of 2020 and the manufacturers will also begin to gradually increase their marketing spending.Another area worth mentioning is e-commerce; [Tech Difficulty] severely impacted the outbreak. The e-commerce sector enjoyed a 3% year-over-year increase in south during the first three months of 2020. Generally speaking since the people avoided going outside during this period, the epidemic accelerated the shift of consumption habits from offline to online, actually benefit the e-commerce industry. So we expected a significant increase in total e-commerce spending for the full year of 2020. Our reporting of the epidemic has led to a surge in our lower user base and in our ad inventory. As a result, we should be able to better serve our e-commerce advertisers going forward.Overall, I think the epidemic has created challenges for our advertising sales. In response, we have also implemented a few measures for our advertising business. For example, we have been shifting some offline events to online. As the surge in our traffic should give our advertiser better brand exposure and a higher sales conversion rate. Also [Tech Difficulty] expanding into new verticals such as study abroad and online education to further diversify our client base. Also we are facing the short-term headwinds on our advertising business. Our brand influence and the public recognition to our in-depth coverage will bolster our growth in the long-term for [Tech Difficulty]Moreover, our gaming business, our subsidiary, Miaoqiu has completed the development of the Golf Players. On February 10th, this game title received its gaming license from the state administration of price and publication. We are currently working closely with leading game producers in China to distribute and launch the game in April. We will for sure update everyone on our progress in these areas in a timely manner going forward. I hope that answer your question, Carmen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Binbin Ding. Please ask your question.
BinbinDing: Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. I wish everyone stay healthy and safe. I have a high level question on your strategy in 2020. So I think the overall media space in China become very dynamic and competitive in past two years. Can you share some colors in terms of your top business priorities in 2020? And with your focus increasingly shifted to content production, how do you balance Phoenix position as a more traditional media platform offering news service versus our new role as a content producer providing more English content such as literature, video content, et cetera. Secondly, could you update as your investment strategy in 2020 given you have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. Thank you.
ShuangLiu: All right, Binbin. This is Shuang. To answer your question; the first operational challenge this year is to significantly reduce our operating loss. As I mentioned in my previous remarks, we are very confident that after adopting the new user grow strategy, we are going to fiercely cut our marketing budget and become more focused on core users for the optimize our user experience. So that the loss will be reduced significantly. That's our top operational challenge and we are confident that we can tackle that challenge.And as to the content strategy, we will -- as you got witnessed in this coronavirus outbreak, we are at the forefront of the covering of the coronavirus. We are very proud of our breaking news coverage, our analysts' high quality professional analysis, our offline charity event and campaign and also the very -- video program targeting at people affected by this virus. So we are going to continue to stick to our core strategy as content -- as a top content player especially in the news and news related areas. Because I think there is -- in this era of uncertainties, the high demand for independent quality and professional news coverage of the major event. That provides us unprecedented opportunity to better serve our users to improve our traffic. And also we have like other players we have Phoenix TV backing us. We can leverage their rich reporting network all over the world. And their topnotch documentaries to enrich our users experience.As to investment and growth strategy, we are continued to explore new growth drivers both organically and through acquisitions. Notably, by combining our operational experience and industry expertise, we have developed a systematic approach to evaluating strategic investment opportunities. Our current priorities are to evaluate acquisition targets with attractive valuation, strong synergistic capabilities and the potential to expand our footprint in such sectors as healthcare, finance and urban lifestyle. And more importantly, in response to the increasing uncertainties brought on by the pandemic, we have also adopted a more cautious approach to our strategic investment and M&A strategy.We believe that we have the right game plan in place to accelerate the development of our new business while mitigating potential use factors to ensure long-term returns for our investors. So as soon as any meaningful progress is made on this front, we will be sure to update everyone maybe. Thank you.End of Q&A
Operator: There are no more questions at this time. I'd now like to hand the conference back to today's speaker. Please begin.
