Youdao’s net revenues for 2021 reached RMB5.4 billion up 69% year-over-year. On a quarterly basis, net revenue increased by 21% to RMB1.3 billion in Q4.

The significant increase was primarily due to the strong top line growth as well as improved cost control measures.

For the full year, total operating expenses were RMB30.6 billion or 35% of our total net revenues. For the fourth quarter total operating expenses were RMB8.3 billion or 34% of net revenues. Looking at the fourth quarter selling marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 13.5% compared with 14.1% in the prior quarter to quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to decrease marketing spending related to Youdao.

The second question is related to Cloud Music. Can you comment on the pricing trend for the subscription and also overall subscription growth target and the margin trend for the business? Thank you.
Charles Yang:  For metaverse, our understanding is that metaverse, is that integration between the virtual and a reality and for NetEase, as we have many, many years of operating MMORPG games and for, MMORPG games, there’s very heavy social elements, and there’s a very sophisticated economic system. And in some, in certain ways you can regard it as a model or prototype for metaverse. And so we’ll continue, in that way. And secondly based on our existing technology, we’ll also, we’ll also be exploring possible new games for metaverse. Thank you.  Okay. Firstly we, that the Cloud Music will continue to grow through comprehensive content offering. And one of that is to, is for us to continue to produce high quality, an exclusive content, and much of it will be self-produced by ourselves in-house and I believe, and we believe that everything will be able to deliver to the Chinese consumers a lot of the high quality Chinese pop music for them. And this is the, so content strategy is our one of the main focus for our growth and expansion. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Natalie Wu with Haitong International.

And my second question is about our core competence in developing a high quality high dose on a consistent basis like Harry Potter and Naraka. Thank you
William Ding: Okay, thank you. So Thomas, the first question in terms of new types of games. So in addition to mobile games, console will also be an important area for us. So, any media you think you can imagine play games on is an area that we want to explore that is where we want to create game content for. In terms of regional focus, both China and overseas and international markets are very important to us, overseas is going to be the next new focus. And in terms, your second question on our core competence, and I think over the last two decades, you can see that NetEase is a company that’s very focused and very dedicated in content creation. And secondly, is that we value our talents. And thirdly is that, we are very much high quality driven. So, we are now, when we think about creating games, we’re not thinking about just in China, but also looking at, we are also taking a global vision.

Thomas Chong: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley.
Alex Poon:  Thanks for management for taking my question. I have two questions. First question its related to our legacy titles. Recently macro environment has not been very good and consumption advertising has not been doing well. And does this weaker macro environment affect our legacy titles, especially those high paying users. And also there have been some daily limits on the loots box, some games does this change affect our growth of our legacy titles? The second question is related to the status of Lord of Rings and the rob blocks  like platform that we discussed before in December. Is there any chance that these two games will come out in Asia in first half? Thank you very much.
William Ding:  So Alex for your first question, is that the, from what we are seeing our legacy titles are actually growing very well throughout last year. And I think you, what you mentioned about the price draw, yes actually has very little impact on us, because we’ve been very conservative in terms of how we monetize, and for games like FWJ if you remember, is actually a time based type of game. So a second question, Lord of Rings, we to release that game in, in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. And for your third question we are going to have – we are actually developing some of the UGC oriented game. And then so some of them will be introduced to the players.
Alex Poon: Thank you very much.
Operator: Moving next to .
Unidentified Analyst:  Thanks management for taking my question, and congrats on your great performance. My question is how should we expect the impact of activation acquired by Microsoft, on their cooperation with NetEase especially for the past range of license games and your cooperation on Diablo and for the more the potential IP license? Thank you.
William Ding:  Yes. So both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard actually have been very close partnership with NetEase over the past years, and we’ve been able – we’ve been operating Minecraft in conjunction with Microsoft and we’ve delivered very good strong results. And we congratulate Microsoft, our Activision Blizzard for coming together. Microsoft is one of the largest gaming platforms in the world with while Activision Blizzard is one of the best game creators in the world. And then we believe that that their partnership will create great synergy and they will create positive impact on the gaming just three. And in China NetEase, have a close relationship with both of them. And we believe that in the partnership between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard will also yield strong, positive impact for us in China too. And from our perspective would also love to explore more possibilities of working with Microsoft. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I’ll take our next question from Guanran Wang with CITIC.
Guanran Wang: Hello. Can you hear? Yes.  Under the current situation of the, the master gaming industry, we have observed that many gaming companies have also taught their publics or optimized the resource allocation. I would like to ask under the calendar dramatic and oversee market environment, how that is well developed are these structure key game categories, strategy of resource allocation and the feature pipeline feature?
William Ding:  So you have been a while since we saw new license approval for NetEase, we are already a game content creator, and we’ve been preparing for the overseas market for a long time. For the past couple of years, you’ve seen some highly successful games in Japan, and you’ve seen us being able to attract some of the biggest global talents to NetEase. We are committed in investing in a global markets. Hopefully in the next two to three years, you’ll see some huge blockbuster titles being produced by NetEase in the global – on the global stage, whether it’s self-developed by us or it’s in a partnership with some of our partner friends. Over the last 20 years, we have accumulated tons of experience in game development in terms of marketing operations, in terms of R&D engines and all of those years, that will give us that strong edge in creating globally successful game. Thank you.
