"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2020 Momo Incorporated Earnings Conference Call.  And please note that this conference is being recorded today. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Ms. Cathey Peng. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Cathey Peng: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Momo's fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. The company's results were released earlier today and are available on the company's IR Web site. On the call today from Momo are Mr. Wang Li, CEO of the company. Mr. Wang Yu, Founder and CEO of Tantan; and Mr. Jonathan Zhang, CFO of the company. They will discuss the company's business operations and highlights, as well as the financials and guidance. We will all be available to answer your questions during -- they will all be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session that follows.
Wang Li: Good morning and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. 2020 was a tough year for all of us. I’m proud that my teams were able to navigate through the many challenges with relentless focus on our core mission which is to help users discover new relationships and built meaningful interactions. The commitment to that core mission also enabled us to make difficult, the right decisions in the past year for the long-term well-being of the company and our community. Getting through that bumpy journey was also a valuable growth experience for my team. I’m happy to see that we have finally come out of those temporary drawbacks, stronger and better poised to seize the growth opportunities ahead of us. My speech today consists of two sections. In the first part I'm going to review the key operating and business results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020. And then I'm going to run through our strategic priorities for the year 2021. And perhaps more importantly, how these near-term strategic priorities fit into our ambitions over the longer term horizon. First of all, a brief overview of the financial performance. For the fourth quarter 2020, total Revenue was RMB3.80 billion, down 19% year-over-year, but up from RMB3.77 billion last quarter. Q4 revenue came in better than our original expectation mainly because of the outperformance from Momo's almost live streaming business in the year end competition event.
Wang Yu: Thanks. So let me briefly review Tantan's operational and business developments in the past quarter and our next step plans. First, a quick review of the user trends and related metrics. Total paying users were impacted by the COVID outbreak in early 2020. By May the pandemic in China got under control, and we subsequently saw decent use recovery from May to early August. Since mid August, the user acquisition cost has started to rise dramatically due to the aggressive marketing investments for medication and online gaming companies, and in Q4 joined by eCommerce players as well. For ROI considerations, we scaled back our spending in the paid marketing channels in Q4, which puts some pressure on the user trend. During Q4, our team fully focused on improving the marketing efficiency and lowering the unit acquisition cost. The team conducted a thorough walkthrough of the system to identify potential areas of improvement and optimization. We realized that marketing and top of the funnel conversion is indeed an area where we need to make increased investment -- improvements in order to get more efficient in driving user growth. There's actually a great deal of essential we can cultivate here. In Q4 and January 2021, we quickly put two things in place for Chinese New Year's campaign. Number one, building up the backend infrastructure to enhance our data tracking capability, so that we can provide more effective feedback to our channel partners. Number two, beefing up ad materials to make it more appealing to our target users. We stepped up our marketing efforts when the competition became milder towards mid-February. We were able to see some initial positive results on the cost side. The new ad materials and channel strategy are also bringing in significantly higher percentage of women in the new users. At the same time, the retention ratio in users also improved meaningfully. Overall, we're on track to deliver a better March DAU than last December. More importantly, we should be able to achieve that while further lowering marketing costs from Q4, which was already a step down from Q3. All of this gave us the confidence that this is the right path to go down. From March onwards, we are going to take bigger steps to refine our marketing approaches. I'll give more details later. Now turning to paying users. Paying users for the fourth quarter of Tantan totaled 3.8 million, down from 4.1 million last quarter. The 300,000 net decrease was due to the combination of the full scale rollout of SVIP package as well as the pressure on the users due to the decreased marketing spending in Q4. Now briefly on revenues. Total revenues for the fourth quarter reached RMB740.5 billion, up 100% year-on-year. The growth was driven by the increase in average revenue per user which is contributed by the live streaming service as well as users continuous shift towards higher priced membership services. For fiscal year 2020, total Revenue was RMB2.37 billion, up 88% from last year. Live streaming contributed the vast majority of the incremental revenue, which amounted to RMB999 million. Despite the decrease in number of paying users, VAS revenue still grew 9% on a year-over-year basis driven by the  ARPPU increase. Next, let me give you an update on the progress that we made against our other strategic priorities. First, enriching the product experiences. One of our biggest focus for 2020 was to build supplementary features and services around the core  experience. So we can offer a richer canvas for users to discover and establish new romantic relationships. In the first half of the year, we introduced a brand new version of Tantan with discovery page and nearby posts and activities, which paved the road for further diversification of our offerings. This is particularly helpful for users who found it less effective to connect in the interact based on the swipe and match mechanism. Providing Tantan users with richer ways to connect beyond our signature swiping experience is an important step that we've taken to enhance user engagements, retention and time spend. Towards the end of last year, we have also begun a limited scale testing on a new voice dating experience, which based on the early data we have been seeing could be positive engagements in revenue driver in the coming few quarters. Another achievement for 2020 was the successful introduction of live video service, which has clearly helped us further optimize monetization value of the platform. This was particularly helpful when our membership business was under COVID related pressure. At the same time, we have also been extremely careful in monitoring and pacing the growth of live streaming service to make sure that we place a complimentary roles in the core dating experience and does no harm to the overall dating ecosystem. So far live streaming has been fitting well into the dating ecosystem without showing any significant undesirable results. In comparison with core mobile live streaming, Tantan's pay -- paying user structure and performance revenue contributions are much more decentralized and long tail driven. Tantan's showrooms are relatively small with fewer concurrent users, but very interactive. The smaller showrooms, you do not have to pay a huge amount in order to get a quality interaction. So the relatively added  distribution structure is very helpful in enhancing the social attributes for the live streaming experience of Tantan. Our intention is to keep our live video channels that way this year. For that reason we're going to continue to control the pace in adding revenue oriented operational reports, especially those that aim at increasing the ARPPU, or otherwise cost centralization. In late Q3, we also started rolling out the new SVIP membership package. New package includes some existing popular membership privileges as well as a number of new premium features added to the package. The goal of introducing the SVIP is of course to offer new valued -- value added services to the dating community. However, we do have a rationale on the business front as well. During the past couple of years, we have consistently observed a key trend that young people in China are demonstrating strong willingness and rising consumption power to pay for dating services. I believe that such trend is going to continue or even accelerate in the coming decade. Long-term wise the best way to take advantage of such secondary trend is certainly to supplement the subscription base model with a good non-sub base value added service mechanism. This is indeed one of our key priorities in the coming few years. But for the time being within the subscription model, we also need a mechanism whereby we can adjust the average selling price, which is by nature more rigid within the sub model. SVIP is our attempted solution here. So far such solution have been working pretty well both in terms of how the user receive it and in terms of hitting the goals we are trying to achieve on a business side. After the rollout of SVIP, we seize to offer some previously accessible features such as separate VAS items. Our general principle in making price efficient is to maximize the revenue. The combination of merchandise replacement and the price strategy led to a de facto priceless effect, which caused the number of subscribers to decline in ARPPU on the contrary to rise. As we expected, Q4 VAS revenue indicates that full scale launch of SVIP is positive to the overall revenue. For the users who churned previous package, but yet subscribed to SVIP, we plan to board them back over time via payroll strategy or new VAS features. Therefore, this approach actually leaves bigger room for us to drive paying user expansion as well as revenue growth in the future. Those are the key updates about the year 2020. Now that we've started the New Year, I'd like to briefly talk about the key things on our agenda for 2021. As Wang Li mentioned, our growth is the top -- of the top priorities for Tantan this year. Two areas that are crucially important for us to achieve the goal -- this goal. First, significantly improve marketing efficiency. The second make the coordinating experience more appealing. On the marketing side, there are a number of things we need to do. Number one, we're going to further optimize our user acquisition system. Although we have made some initial progress in beefing up our channel marketing approach, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. These efforts range from making fundamental changes to the backend infrastructure such as enhancing our data tracking capability and feedback system to improving the ad materials and adjusting them based on the outcome of the campaign. Number two, optimize our use of conversion model, so we can drive better ROI for user acquisition. Number three, enhance our brand awareness. Tantan is a relatively young brand, there are still many people who are not using Tantan because they have not heard of us before. We're yet to be fully aware of the core value of Tantan improvise. We will invest more to empower our brand equity and drive user awareness this year. The second area we need to improve is -- is to enhance the coordinating experience. While Tantan is undoubtedly the most dedicated and effective dating app in China, we do have many opportunities to optimize, so we can do better in connecting the users for romantic purposes. The most near-term priority is to make our swipe and match system more effective. Our efforts include upgrading the use of tagging system to generate better portraits of each of the Tantan users. And based on the tagging and other aspects of big data mining, optimizing the recommendation engine to make more relevant searches. We want the users to genuinely feel that Tantan understands what they're looking for on the platform. While continuing to strengthen our dating related product offering, we're also going to keep exploring more diversified features and services to make Tantan experience better fit for Asian dating culture. This in turn will further improve user engagement and retention which will translate to user growth. Those are the key things that I'd like to cover for today. So let me pass the call over to Mr. Jonathan Zhang for a financial review. Jon, please.
Jonathan Zhang: Thank you. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. Let me briefly take you through the financial review. Total revenue for the fourth quarter 2020 was RMB3.8 billion, down 19% year-on-year, up 1% quarter-on-quarter, exceeding the high end of our revenue guidance, primarily due to the better-than-expected outcome from the year-end competition event in live streaming business. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Momo was RMB836.4 million compared to RMB1.25 billion for the same period of 2019 or a 33% decrease year-over-year. Total revenue for fiscal year 2020 was RMB15.02 billion compared to RMB17.02 billion for 2019, down 12% year-on-year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Momo for 2020 was RMB2.9 billion compared to RMB4.49 billion for 2019, a decrease of 36% year-on-year. The year-over-year decrease in top line and bottom line was due to the impact from the pandemic during the first half of the year and the structural reform in the second half in 2020, partially offset by Tantan's rapid growth in revenue and narrowing loss. Looking to the key revenue line items for the quarter. Firstly, on live broadcasting. The total revenue for live broadcasting in business for the fourth quarter of 2020 was RMB4.33 billion, down 31% from the same period last year, and 2% from last quarter. Core Momo's live broadcasting revenue totaled RMB1.92 billion for the fourth quarter, down 43% from the same period last year, and 3% from last quarter, while Tantan's live broadcasting revenue amounted RMB404 million, 2% up from previous quarter. Moving on to VAS revenue. From the -- revenue from the value added services reached RMB1.4 billion, up 18% year-on-year, 5% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue from VAS, excluding RMB336 million from Tantan reached RMB1.07 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, a 30% increase year-over-year, 7% increase sequentially. The solid performance of Momo's core VAS business was primarily driven by the teams focus on product innovation and effective operational efforts. Audio and video based social entertainment experience continued to generate strong growth momentum, and was the biggest revenue driver for the core Momo VAS services. Now let me briefly review the costs and expenses items for the quarter. Our non-GAAP cost of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was RMB4.02 billion compared to RMB3.32 billion for the same period last year. Non-GAAP cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 53%, an increase from 50% from Q4 2019. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for the quarter was down 3% from a year-ago. The decrease was attributed to the following factors. Number one, high payout ratio from the core Momo's live broadcasting business. Number two, lower gross margin for Tantan, as its live broadcasting services revenue has become increasingly sizable. Number three, higher payout ratio from core Momo VAS business due to the robust growth coming from audio, video based social entertainment business, a big part of which involves third-party professional moderators. And the number four, certain fixed nature of cost items such as headcount, depreciation of fixed assets related impacted the gross margin negatively as the total revenue declined and this items represent a higher percentage of total net revenue. On a sequential basis, the non-GAAP gross margin remained flattish compared to Q3, much better than our original expectation. As Wang Li mentioned earlier, in Q4 we successfully lock down a vast majority of existing high grossing broadcasters by rolling out a new incentive program. We originally had expected this new plan to have a couple of percentage adverse impact on the gross margin. However, the team was able to optimize the overall cost structure so that the gross margin remain the same as in Q3. This demonstrates management's commitment to drive healthy growth of the business not only for the revenue aspect, but also as the gross profit and cash flow level. This year, we will focus at our supporting mid to long tail broadcasters and further strengthening the content ecosystem, a very important step for us to achieve that goal is to provide better motivation and recruit new talents so that we can maintain a good metabolic system. To serve that goal, in q1, we made another adjustment to our incentive program to make it more attractive to the new comers. We currently expect this new program to have a couple percentage impact to our gross margin starting from Q1. In return, we now have a well rounded incentive program that can provide sufficient motivation to all important broadcasters in our ecosystem. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for the quarter was RMB286.5 million compared to RMB244.3 million for the same period last year, representing 7.5% and 5.2% of total revenue, respectively. We ended the quarter with 2,394 total employees of which 807 are from Tantan. The R&D personnel as a percentage of total employees for the group was 57% compared to 58% last year. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter was RMB654.1 million or 17.2% of total revenue compared to RMB554 million or 14% of total revenue for the same year last year. Non-GAAP G&A expenses was RMB134.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to RMB151.7 million for the same quarter last year, representing 3.5% and 3.2% for the total revenue, respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 28.3%, an increase from 22.4% from Q4 2019. The increase was mainly due to the negative operating leverage as a result of a decrease in total revenue. Now briefly on income tax expenses. In Q4, the company received an approval for qualification of Key Software Enterprise for one of our major profit generating entities to enjoy a 10% preferential income tax rate. For the fiscal year of 2019, which enabled us to lower our tax rate for the entity from 12.5% to 10% for fiscal year 2019. Therefore, we subsequently reversed the over accrued tax liability of RMB113 million to reduce the current quarter income tax expenses. As this qualification application is assessed by the relevant tax authorities annually, we make this tax adjustments upon receipt of our approval notice going forward. Now turning to balance sheet and cash flow items. At December 31, 2020, Momo's cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and long-term deposits totaled RMB16.48 billion compared to RMB15.23 billion as of December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was RMB1.04 billion. Lastly on business outlook. We estimated our first quarter revenue for 2021 to come in the range from RMB3.36 billion to RMB3.46 billion, representing a decrease of 6.5% to 3.7% year-on-year to a decrease of 11.5% to 8.8% quarter-over-quarter. For Q1 2021, on a year-over-year basis, we expected the total revenue from core Momo to decrease in low teens percentage. Total revenue from Tantan is expected to grow in the high 40s percentage. Please be mindful that the forecast represent the company's current and preliminary view on the market and operational conditions which are subject to change. That concluded our prepared portion of today's discussion. With that, let me turn the call back to Cathey to start the Q&A. Cathey, please?
Cathey Peng: Actually just a quick reminder for people who are in the queue to ask the question in Chinese first, and perhaps follow with English translation by yourself. And also if you could limit the number of questions to one to two, that will give more time for other people to ask questions. Operator, ready for questions. Thank you.
Q - Thomas Chong: Thanks management for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first one is about the user and the revenue trend during and after Chinese New Year for core Momo and Tantan. And also, can management comment about the full year outlook, if possible. And my second question is about the spending. Can you comment about the marketing spending for this year as well as the overall margin outlook? Thank you.
Wang Li: Let me translate first. It has been around 5 weeks after the lunar year holiday. During that period of time, it's fair to say that the Momo core has been seeing pretty encouraging recovery trends, both in terms of traffic and in terms of grossing. I would attribute that positive trajectory to three major factors. One is the progress that we made in improving the basic social experience last year on the core. And the second factor is the fruits coming out of the structural reform in the second half of the year. And the third factor is the right approaches that we adopted on the channel marketing side both during and after Chinese New Year for the core Momo. More specifically on the user front, the average DAU so far into March on the core has already exceeded last December's level in a pretty meaningful way. On the grossing front, we did see a pretty mean -- pretty significant decline in both live streaming and VAS during the 3 weeks around Chinese New Year. But up until now, live streaming -- for live streaming, it has already entered into a period of steady improvement and VAS has truly been an outperformer here. Its grossing has far exceeded -- already far exceeded the pre-Chinese New Year level. It looks like that in Q1 we are going to see a pretty meaningful sequential growth from last Q4, and even on a wide basis we're going to see very notable acceleration which is very impressive to me. For the whole year, although now it's still a little bit too early to get very prescriptive, but here are some big trends that I'm ready to share. For live streaming, I think this year will still be -- still about improving the content ecosystem in reaching and diversifying the long tail content. So I would definitely put stabilization as the number one priority. And for that reason, I'm not going to adopt aggressive approaches to stimulate short-term revenue. But as the overall content ecosystem continues to recover, the spending is also going to see steady and gradual improvement on top of Q1. And as I said, we need that steady improvement to happen not just at the revenue level, we needed to happen at a gross profit level as well. For that, on the core, we're actually seeing a greater number, a greater number of growth opportunities relative to live streaming and also from a product and traffic allocation perspective, we are also going to be leaning more towards VAS because it does have a more flattish distribution structure in comparison with -- the VAS does have a more flattish distribution structure in comparison with live streaming. And it is also more tightly knitted into the vantage that we have as a social platform. So my expectation is that this year VAS is also -- VAS is still going to be growing very robustly on a year-over-year basis as a percentage of total revenue, it's also going to continue to rise. At the group level, I think the VAS revenue in Q1 is expected to reach close to 80% of live streaming revenue. In the future, I'm also hoping that we can continue to drive out that ratio from there. That is the fundamental differentiation and advantage that we have as a social platform as opposed to other entertaining providers out there in the market. I think this year you guys are going to see us capitalizing on that advantage and differentiation in a bigger way than we did in the past. Now here's Wang Yu to talk about Tantan.
Wang Yu: Okay. So firstly, let me elaborate a bit on the  trends. In January and early February, we pretty much focused on building our user acquisition materials, and fixing other technical stuff in order to make the Chinese New Year campaigns more effective. So the December week user trends continued in January and early February. They -- usually they started ticking up from late February. As said, we're on track to deliver a better March DAU than last December, while further lowering the total marketing costs from Q4. Revenue wise we had pretty strong seasonality this year due to the streaming services. Because we have the big majority of our live streaming revenue coming from long tail broadcasters are difficult to manage. The broadcasting time and the number of channels saw a very significant decline during the winter period, winter holiday period,  the revenue to see a deep dive and also a slow recovery. Now the supply has come back and we expect the revenue to gradually ramp up from Q2 onwards. Now some thoughts about the whole year. User growth is the single most important priority for Tantan this year. We had some initial success in sorting out the user acquisition approach in the post-Chinese New Year campaign. It definitely shows that we are heading towards the right direction. In the coming few months, we've lined up a few other new product updates, most of which aim at further improving the retention ratio on the platform. We're confident that with these products and marketing efforts, we're going to see solid user growth this year. Revenue is not one of the top priorities for the company this year, neither is profit. We certainly care about top and bottom line, and long-term wise, they should be the outcome of user growth. But if this year, any of the financial goals temporarily goes against the product and user goals, we will definitely put a ladder on top. Here's an example. As I said, after we adjusted our marketing approach, Tantan now has a much higher percentage of females in the newly acquired users, which is going to be a big, big benefit for dating ecosystem. However, that actually lowers the paying in conversion ratio pretty significantly, because women are much less likely to pay the lump. Previously, we would have tried to reverse that chain to raise the paying conversion because we need to meet quarterly numbers in revenue and paying users et cetera. But this year, this is going to be an example that we're going to put the short-term numbers aside and focus on what's really important for our future. That said, I believe overall, we're still going to see pretty decent growth on the top line for 2021. Here are some drivers for it. Firstly, user growth will drive VAS growth. Secondly, we're going to be rolling out a few new monetization features this year. Some of these are sub based and others are other cards . For example, the virtual gifting around the voice dating experience that sort of drives our people on the VAS. For live streaming this year, we'll make it subservient to the product and . This year, we also prefer not to go any further in terms of raising monetization levels. Putting everything together, most likely we will end this year with the majority of revenue coming from VAS, which goes more hand in hand with coordinating in relation to live streaming. Thanks.
Jonathan Zhang: Thomas, this is Jon. Let me address your second question. On the marketing strategy for core Momo, actually we are looking to keep the same level of channel investment for the payment -- for the marketing channels, same dollar amount, similar dollar amount for -- from last year. However, as Wang Yu said, this year some of our new apps are getting tractions. And with that we do like to keep the flexibility to invest more to grow the users and revenues for those new initiatives. But, however, we are focusing on the revenue growth on those new apps. So I guess we are probably looking to increase the marketing resources available for those new initiatives. We're looking at probably around 1 to 2 percentage of total revenue for core Momo. So -- but, however, we're only to make adjustments on this level where the spending plan on as we go basis, because a lot of it really depending on the performance of ROI. So that's the moving piece. For Tantan, as Wang Yu just mentioned, Tantan's team is the top priority on user growth. So we're going to spend -- how much they're going to spend? We're going to really -- it will really depend on the pace and magnitude of the improvement of its marketing efficiencies and product rollout. So if we move faster, we will spend more. But however, the VAS revenue will grow up more. And if we need more time, we'll spend less and the VAS revenue will ramp up a bit slower. So, instead of managing the line by line target, we are more focusing on targeting a range of bottom line. At this stage, we are looking at further narrowing down the adjusted net loss for 2021 down by RMB150 million to RMB200 million from last year's level. So, that's on the Tantan side. In terms of margin trends, on top of the additional potentials ending from core Momo, on the gross margin side, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, due to the newly launched incentive program for new broadcasters, we do expect  margin impact on the gross profit -- gross margin side. And that's for starting from Q1. You can apply that throughout the year. And, however, there are other factors probably will impact the margin on a quarterly basis such as the revenue mix might have some impact. But, however, we don't expect a  will be significant. So, overall, the gross margin will see a 2% to 3% downtick for the year and also the potential -- higher selling marketing expenses from core Momo. Thank you.
Thomas Chong: Got it. Thank you.
Cathey Peng: Operator -- yes, operator, we're ready for next and maybe for the interest -- in the interest of time, this will be the last one we take -- we take in.
Operator: Thank you. Yes. Our next question is from the line of Tian Hou of TH Capital. Please go ahead.
Tian Hou: Yes. Good morning, management. Just a question on the VAS. Look at the financial results VAS was growing pretty rapidly and also Mr. Wang expressed enough confidence for 2021. So can Mr. Wang elaborate a little bit further the drivers for VAS continue to grow in 2021? That's my question.
Wang Li: With regards to the future outlook for VAS, we are actually seeing plenty of growth opportunities in VAS both in terms of product innovations as well as revenue growth. As I said, over 80% of the time spend on Momo is in a variety of social experiences that are not related to live streaming at all. There is actually a lot of potential that we can cultivate in this big pool of users and traffic. In addition other than Momo and Tantan, this year some of our newer applications are also becoming more meaningful revenue contributors and that could push the VAS opportunities beyond the core Momo. More specifically, I think in the year 2021, we are mainly looking at several key drivers. Number one is we're going to continue to bring in new product innovations into the chat room experience. Things like the new interactive gifting experience, the new game plays into the karaoke experience, all of these have proven to be effective levers that we can pull to drive continuous growth in the chat room. And the second area of growth is the opportunity -- the revenue opportunities around the new applications and the new paying experiences that we're testing. Things like Hertz and the video matchmaking experience both within our core website which is  and as a separate application, which is . Other than these we also had a few -- a couple of other . These new opportunities are increasingly coming into fruition on the revenue side. And -- so they can be more of a longer term driver for the VAS line. And the third driver this year is going to be the innovations within the older experiences. For example, the interest group is a old experience that has been around for many years  after have been around since the year 2012. But after the introduction of new gifting experience, it started growing very impressively in the last year making it actually one of the most important drivers for the VAS line. This year we also have plans to continue to introduce new stuff into the one-to-one  chatting and also the group chatting in order to activate people's willingness to pay for VAS. Now about Tantan, content VAS is actually at a very early stage of development in terms of user growth, ARPPU and the overextension of paying experiences. I think, obviously, the biggest, biggest priority for Tantan this year is on user growth instead of pulling other revenue levers. But actually in the coming 3 to 5 years, Tantan should actually have bigger potential -- bigger revenue potential in the form of VAS than Momo has today. I think we're approaching the markets open. So that will be the last question that we take today. And that also wrap up -- wraps up the conference call for today. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you next quarter. Operator, we're ready to close.
Operator: Thank you.
Cathey Peng: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s . Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect."
