Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nelson Cheung from Citi.
Nelson Cheung :  So let me translate myself. So with the revenue decline of reservation revenue this year, can management share the reasons behind it? And what's your expectation for the long-term trend of this business going forward?
Xing Jin : 
A –Vivian XU : First is due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in some member cities, consumers' confidence is weaker than normal and their willingness to spend is not that strong. It's impacted medical aesthetics market.

And also for the next year, what do you see for user growth and revenue growth? My second question is about the progress in So-Young PASS. Compared to surgical categories, which is greatly impacted by COVID-19, how is the growth trend for nonsurgical category and highlights here?
Xing Jin : 
Vivian XU : Thank you for the first question. In Q3 and Q4, the rebound of pandemic in some cities brought short-term uncertainties to our business. We are monitoring the development of the market and we'll make adjustments for our marketing strategy timely.

Vivian XU : For the Q4 and next year, we believe the popularity of nonsurgical category will maintain its momentum. We will solidify our existing strong position on surgical side while executing our established strategy on nonsurgical side to penetrate into more market and gain more market share.
Xing Jin : 
Vivian XU : In the past several years, the main driver for the growth of medical aesthetics industry came from the plastic surgeries because these surgeries are nonstandard treatments, the quality of which is largely dependent on surgeon doctors. Therefore, the status of the industry remains fragmented with no universal standard and poor service quality. The COVID-19, by some degree, has changed user behavior. In the meantime, the advancement of the technology of light aesthetics and expanding user group are accelerating the development of the digitalization and the standardization of the industry.

Among them, the online GMV for the Fotona4D even grew over 400% year-over-year.
Xing Jin : 
Vivian XU : In addition, we added So-Young PASS to the shop opening and the promotional campaigns of newly joined institutions, healthy and small- and medium-sized institution with less online resources and operations experience to rapidly increase the exposure and improve accurate client acquisition.
Xing Jin : 
Vivian XU : In summary, we mentioned before, So-Young PASS is just the first step as we take to enhance contract performance for user and also investing use on the nonsurgical side. For the whole nonsurgical business benefited from the rising popularity of nonsurgical services, we are committed to standardization of nonsurgical service in the long term, continuously enhance content performance and ensure users to enjoy a premium experience of authentic products on the nonsurgical side.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Chiang from Deutsche Bank.
Leo Chiang :  I'll translate my question. So my question is regarding the MAU and sales and marketing. Just wondering why the reason behind the MAU decrease and the reason behind the decrease in marketing expense? And what is the marketing and promotion strategy for next quarter and next year?
Xing Jin : 
Vivian XU : Firstly, due to the impact -- negative impact of resurgence of COVID-19 in some large cities, consumer confidence was hurt and consumption willingness declined resulting in the Q-on-Q decrease in MAU.

Vivian XU : Looking forward to the whole year of 2021, we estimate the total sales and marketing expense will account for no more than 50% of our revenues, maintaining the same level as we projected in the beginning of this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shiqi Ge from CICC.
Shiqi Ge:  Just wondering if you could give us more business update on Wuhan Miracle? And since you added the business of upstream equipment supply, could you please also share with us more color about your long-term development strategy?
Xing Jin : 
Vivian XU : In the third quarter, we closed the deal of acquiring Wuhan Miracle. We have set up a flagship store for Wuhan Miracle on our platform and promote its products to our users and integrate its products with So-Young PASS. As of early November, So-Young had established business relations with more than 30 institutions derived from Wuhan Miracle network.

Vivian XU : With the refinement of our operation, our online service will be more standardized and transparent in price. We are able to correctly display to users the place of production, usage, specification and other information. We are also pioneered in offering online rights protection at no cost, providing advanced compensation and insurance for relevant medical aesthetics treatment to our users.
Xing Jin : 
Vivian XU : At present, as we better understand the medical aesthetics industry, we are aware that the higher transaction value of upstream products and the limited choice of categories have set limits for more users to enjoy medical aesthetics consumption.  user demand side, we are seeing that medical aesthetics consumption expanding out of the original user base as the demands for the medical aesthetics continues to rise. For that reason, we believe at the current stage, we will leverage ages of our platform, enhance cooperation with the supply end, explore into new industry, enable more users to have access to good medical aesthetics experience and expand the overall market size. 
Operator: If there are no further questions. That brings to the end of a call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect now. Thank you all.
