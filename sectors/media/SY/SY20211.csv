Operator: Thank you. . First question comes from the line of Thomas Chong of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Thomas Chong:   Thanks management for taking my questions. Management talks about how we are going to operate our pool, our users in 2021 and how we are going to better monetize our users as well as detract. If possible, can management share about MAU target, as well as marketing strategies? 
Min Yu: Okay, I will be answering these questions. Our user growth strategy in 2021 won’t change compared to the 2020. We will still be focused on expanding our user base and increase our penetration in terms of our targeted user base.  For the last part of your question is you said, what’s your MAU, what’s our MAU target and the guidance. I think although we never provided that guidance in the previous quarters, but we still see positive increase in terms of our MAU. For the first quarter of average MAU, it’s around like 8.4 million and going forward we expect our MAU at the end of the year still seeing around 40% growth, that's our target.  For, what's our strategy and how we’re going to spend our sales and marketing budget? As you can see in the first quarter result, we did have bigger or larger than normal, our previous quarters spending in sales and marketing. Excluding those payrolls, we have around 192 million on the spend on the customer acquisition.  We think that we have around 102, have been focused on branding, which we associated with the TV shows as mentioned earlier in the previous quotes and we also for – in terms of promoting our slim festival in March, we did spend a large campaign offline with Focus Media. So that’s the extra spending compared to the first quarter of last year, same period of last year and even more the fourth quarter of 2020.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Chiang of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Leo Chiang :  Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. So my question is that what is the provision of marketing expense and the trend for institutional which you are spending on So-Young’s platform and you’re ? Okay, thank you.
A - Xing Jin:  Okay, so first according to Frost & Sullivan report, the take-off online customer acquisition spending by the medical aesthetics service industry in China was about 20% in the past five years. The percentage of total customer acquisition spending on online medical aesthetics platform has continued to increase from less than 2% in 2015 to 13% in ’19.  The market share of the online platform is continuously expanding and secondly, in terms of the number of institution at our platform, we have formed a partnership with more institutions. In the first quarter we could see that a number of pain medical service providers on our platform was up more than 40% than the number of more than 4,700. Thanks to our target user base and our strong brand recognition among users. And lastly, we think that we use improvement in institutions operation capabilities. We see that their spending behavior is also growing mature as they turn to customer acquisition channels with better ROI performance. In order to reduce overall customer acquisition cost, those institutions are also testing new ways to improving their – new ways to put their allocation off marketing, also improving their own capabilities.  We believe that as long as our performance is better than the PS in the market, our contribution to the – our contribution of value in the industry is increasing, institution we are meeting their proprietaries for So-Young when they are allocating their spending. Thank you.
Leo Chiang : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from  of CICC. 
Unidentified Analyst:  Thanks management for taking my questions. I noticed that we have recently signed a cooperation contract with Bloomage Biotechnology. So could you provide more detailed directions for future cooperation with upstream manufacturers or the suppliers? Thank you. 
Xing Jin:  Going forward, we will continue to strengthen cooperation with medical product manufacturers to have better control over our user experience. So let me elaborate why then we choose to cooperate, we choose to enter an inclusive comprehensive strategic cooperation agreement with Bloomage Biotechnology skin booster products.  If you see the, according to the agreement we were in partner with Bloomage and helped the latter on two strategic initiatives. One is hyaluronic acid program and one is creating the future medical aesthetics alliance. We think that we will become the strategic partner to help each and medical aesthetics service provides. And also, we think that in several ways we will provide comprehensive support like in – like including product R&D and new product training.  In addition, we have also developed a packaging solution for its hyaluronic acid program. So as the largest medical aesthetics platform in China, So-Young will maintain our leadership in the industry and enable efficient connection between consumers and the business. 
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Vincent Yu of Needham & Company. Please go ahead. 
Vincent Yu:   Hi management! Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. The first question is the medical, is about the trends on the two categories of the medical aesthetics market. The medical aesthetics market has been  beginning of the year with significant growth. Management also mentioned strong demand on the consumer side. Can you share more details about the trends for surgical and non-surgical treatments respectively? And how do we gain a competitive edge in the light, in surgical headway. And for the surgical treatments, have we returned to normal stage compared to the 2020? And then my second question is about the So-Young Pass. Can management gives us more color on So-Young Pass, how much revenue contribution can we expect to see and how much – how many cities we are planning to enter this year. Thank you. 
Xing Jin:  First, the medical aesthetics market as a whole is under healthy recovery. We see that the users’ willingness to purchase and the interest keep increasing. So if you see the number that’s due in the first quarter, MAU on our platform reached 8.2 million and maintained a very good rate of the gross.  So, in addition to the content consumption, our user average time spent in the introduction with the institutions and doctors, both increased significantly year-over-year and your question is on the surgical booking, we could see that the surgical booking gradually recovering and the number of reservation has return to the level before the pandemic. Yet the total GMV is still a bit behind that.  Non-surgical bookings kept a strong momentum. We can that during the slim festival in the March daily average GMV for injections treatment increased by 62% compare with the double 11 last year and so we still see that like the injection, skin care and anti-aging women are most popular treatments to users our platform.  We could see that the competition among nonsurgical sector is intensified this year for both upstream - to upstream manufacturers to the downstream institutions. In contrast the consumer side count fully understand and evaluate service, those services like the effect and the risk is behind that, aiming to sort of pinpoint of consumers. This year we will continue to leverage the age of our platform in content and community, construction and also enhance consumer protection and optimize user experience on all platforms.    We, first of all to improve the online users experience for products units and enhance user trust on our platform, so we do it in three ways: One is of course increase in the total SKU supply. And we also – secondly, we also refined our product library enhancing standardization and improving description of service and SKUs; and third, we refined payment and aftersales warranty systems to protect the whole users experience.  So you could see that we separate our down surgical treatments and first of all it’s for those low end product line. We reinforce our leading position in both SKUs and pricing system, as well as the regional and also the categories coverage.  For the mid to the high end product line, we could see that the So-Young Pass are widely recognized by our users and we successfully to improve the performance, our promise to the contract terms, which could focus in to acquire those mid to high end customers group. And later we enhance corporation with upstream manufacturers who are metrics of So-Young Ambassador program, PUGC and the New Media Content. It is in an effort to increase content supply and user engagement for non-surgical treatments.  Lastly, enhance the customer recognition of our expertise in non-surgical. So some like the shopping events; some shopping events line the anti-aging festival and the slim festival, as well as market contents. Thanks all, thank you.    Referring to your question about the So-Young Pass, since the launch in last October, So-Young Pass program has now expanded to 11 cities, with more than 90 institution partners. In terms of the product selection, we regularly hold events to select product for our So-Young Pass program and consistently optimize our SKUs, especially for the non-surgical product standardization, we have extended our standardized category to 30 plus. So this allows us to a flattish standards and expansion transparency in the non-surgical sector.  Meanwhile in terms of the order fulfillment, we saw that complaint rate for the projects under the So-Young Pass program largely below those, our main apps for the reservation products. At the revenue level, since the So-Young Pass have not scaled up yet and did not contribute a meaningful revenue, at this moment we still give the subsidy to our end users, so we did not separate a different line for this growth, a more detailed number on the revenue level of So-Young Pass. But we are generally saying that the total tech rate for the So-Young Pass program was higher than other products. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect."
