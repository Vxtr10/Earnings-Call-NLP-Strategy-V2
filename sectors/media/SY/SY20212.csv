On the regulatory front, over the past few months regulatory authorities have expressed their views and opinions on various matters such as antitrust, data security and medical aesthetics advertising and issued a series of policies and guidance for multiple industries. We have taken this opportunity to reflect on our practice and our role as an industry leader and engage in self-reflection and introspection. First of all, since our inception, we have established a stringent review and approval process for all doctors and institutions, as well as conducted rigorous review mechanism for content and service offering on our platform. In addition, following the guidance issued by regularity bodies at various levels, we have an established internal review process and continued to improve the online information we provided of medical aesthetics services.  At the same time, we have also been actively engaged in the self-discipline of China's medical aesthetics industry by promoting platform governance and assisting our institution partners with compliance audits and promoting a standardized and orderly development of the medical aesthetics industry. To summarize, we believe the Chinese medical aesthetics industry is well on the track of steady growth. As a leader in the industry, we have the responsibility to make industry better by promoting industry standards and providing authentic and truly valuable services for our users. Looking forward, we will leverage our competitive advantage in content, technology and our large user base and continue to focus our efforts on user acquisition and expand our online presence into other segments of the industry.

This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call to the operator and open the call for Q&A. Operator we are ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from Thomas Chong of Jefferies. Please ask your question.
Thomas Chong: Now I will translate myself. What are the company's view regarding the recent changes, on the advertising guidelines regulating the beauty, medical sector, which were issued by the state administration for market regulation? And how it will affect the company's business moving forward. Thank you.
Xing Jin: Thank you. We noticed that documents issued by regularity or authorities since the beginning of this year have mainly been focused on supervising their practice of medical institutions in the medical aesthetics sector. We believe that such supervision is conducted to their long-term and healthy development of the entire industry. As an internet medical services information, since our inception, we have established a business review and approval process for all the doctors and institutions we partner with as well as content and product review mechanism. We are committed to build strong governance across our platform and strive to curb any non-compliant activities. In terms of having medical information featured on our platform in order to cooperate with So-Young medical institutions are required to submit their state issued business license, medical institution practice license and other documents issued by governance authorities as well as have our internal review and verification. We also require doctors to provide their qualification certificates and verified practice license before information can be published on our platform. In terms of publishing content on products and services, we have built a rigorous information display system equipped with risk control and anti-fraud systems. Information displayed by institutions must first meet our strict requirements. And we have two additional review procedures, one automated and the other by manual inspections. We have also a professional compliance team that closely monitors state policies and standards in real time, which we then compile to optimize our platforms verification system and standardization process. We also have a strict set of violation information risk control model library. Because of professional internal risk control measurement and the platform governance, we think that this should be the operational strength that differentiate us from our peers. Last May we initiated a self-discipline campaign for China's medical aesthetics industry to promote platform governance. Regarding the draft guidelines on regularity in advertising the medical aesthetic sector issued by SAMR, we will provide our feedback through appropriate channels on the premise of protecting the legal rights and interests of consumers. Through positive and constructive feedback, we aim to create a voice for medical aesthetics professionals and at the same time, provide better service to our customers and promote regulated and orderly environments for the development of the industry. Meanwhile, we also believe that with strict regulation and further execution of specific rules, offline medical institutions are required to enhance their services capability and medical level, not blindly pursue traffic growth in marketing and user acquisition and even treat consumers with faith or specialty . Institutions will be more cautious selecting marketing channels.  Also the enforcement guidance also clarifies that online platform operators’ duties to perform contracts and to do the verification and government’s online platform compliance will be enhanced. In this regard as the first mover in the industry to start and continuously self-discipline, we believe that So-Young will be benefited by the regulation in the long run. In the long-term, we believe that regulations will prove highly conductive to the healthy development of industry. For So-Young we are committed to adhere to all regulations. And we will continue to further improve our internal review mechanism to full compliance and regular self-governance. To lead by example we will remain proactive in intercepting medical aesthetics, promotional information that doesn't comply to the rules, in order to offer authentic information and online services and promote better care in the medical aesthetics industry. Okay, thank you. That's all.
Operator: The next question comes from Nelson Cheung of Citi. Please ask your question.
Nelson Cheung : So let me first state it out in English. Thanks management for taking my questions. So my question is regarding to business prospects. Can management share your views related to the impact of COVID on your business? And can you share more details about the growth trend going into the second half of this year?  And my second question is related your progress on So-Young Pass, the SY Pass. Yeah, thank you.
Xing Jin: In July and August, China faced the double impact of COVID-19 resurfacing in the few cities and damages from flooding disasters. Operations of medical institutions were adversely affected in the first tier and second tier cities, such as Shanghai, Chengdu. Nanchang and Jinjiang. As the situation got under control, medical institutions were able to resume operations and return to their regular growth trend. Looking to the business growth in the second half of this year, firstly policies in particular regulations for medical aesthetics advertising required institution to conduct self-inspection first in the near term for unqualified products and treatments from their offerings. Meanwhile, the enforcement guidelines also set clear requirements for online performing operators to fulfill the duties imposed by laws. As a result, institutions will be more cautious about marketing in the near term. In the second half of this year, taking advantage of the rising popularity of non-surgical treatments, we will continue to implement our established strategy to grow the non-surgical categories, further penetrate and expand market share while maintaining our strength in the surgical category. As of the end of August, So-Young Pass has extended its network to 36 cities from 11 tier 1 and the number of institutions increased from 95 to over 160. The number of verified orders on So-Young Pass also increased by 40% in Q2 compared to Q1. That's all thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Leo Chiang of Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question.
Leo Chiang : Let me translate myself. So thanks management for taking my question. My question is regarding to competition landscape. Can management share the latest competition landscape you have observed recently? Thank you.
Xing Jin: At current level of market competition, we believe it is no longer purely about competing for user traffic, but whether platform can really address the pain point for users and improve user experience. From the perspective of both regulation and a better user experience, platform must be professional at all times and have in-depth knowledge of the industry. As the popularity of non-surgical category increase in demand, we will continue to strengthen the operation of non-surgical category and implement our established strategy to expand market share on top of growing our entire medical aesthetics, user base.  Meanwhile, we are continuously strengthening our cooperation with other platform to empower the entire medical aesthetics industry. For instance, that we partnered with JD.com to establish JD Healthy Medical Aesthetics channel so that consumers can experience and have easy access to professional and premier medical aesthetic services.  Besides that, we also worked with AutoNavi to connect with other 1,000 institutions and established a consumer service for medical aesthetics users on their Amap platform. So-Young Pass has also achieved more strategic co-operations with like Little Red Book,  and Weibo and we hope to explore popular treatments in medical aesthetics, build a premier shortlist of select products and expand our service scope to continuing powering more institutions. That's all. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Yu from Needham & Company. Please ask your question.
Vincent Yu : Thanks, management. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. One is to follow up on the impact on the regulation. So my question is more focused on how the regulation impacts the traditional industry structure and like traditional practices in this industry? And how we view this as a potential opportunity? And second question is on the Miracle Laser acquisition. How shall we think about the strategy behind this acquisition? We're kind of cooperation we will have between this manufacturing company and the institutional clients? And also what kind of monetization model we are hoping to see for the future. Yes, thank you.
Xing Jin: First we believe that the regulation action against the non-compliant practice and strict regulatory requirements will benefit. It's a healthy development of the whole industry in the long run. With tightening of regulations, local regulation will further clarify and the detail the approval system and the process for institution adapters. Meanwhile, the usage specifications for drugs and equipment will be strengthened, forming more effective protection for manufacturers and institution producing, distributing and using genuine and authentic products. Beyond entry compliance, we are seeing that the stricter regulations were to some extent driving institutional base level from their marketing customer acquisition to internal operations, serves to improve service quality. Besides educating consumers to distinguish and select services, institutions need to retain clients with good service and skills. Institution won’t survive long by focusing only on customer position and ignoring management and service quality. Tightened market regulation had significant driving effect, standardization and going online for the entire medical aesthetics market, particularly the non-surgical medical aesthetics market.
Min Yu : Yes. I will try to answer your questions about our acquisition of Miracle Laser. As mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks in the previous part, Miracle Laser is one of the biggest manufacturer for laser medical machineries in China. And we think the synergies going forward between the platform of So-Young and further cooperation with the manufacturers -- with a branded manufacturers like Wuhan Miracle, will have a new complete service experience for users on the platform. And at the same time, we can make sure the services taken by the customers will have a very consistent experience. It also will have certain cost-saving effect like we will provide our platform customers directly to the clinic or hospitals who have Wuhan Miracle’s medicine instruments or equipment directly. And we will like share the revenues between that. And it will be a showcase attempt for us for the further co-operations with upstream manufacturers in medical aesthetic service industry. Going forward, we will see further co-operations with other branded manufacturers to provide consistent and of course, the consistent screening drugs and medical devices and service providers to our customers. At the same time, Wuhan Miracle itself is a very well-run business. They have been listed in the NEED  exchange in China for almost six years, being highly compliant in terms of financial control and internal control. And they have been experiencing of course, and the industry as a whole has been hit by the COVID-19 in 2020, but they have recovered quite well in the first half of this year. And we feel very positive for its going forward growth after being acquired by us. And our co-operation will adding more elements for the business going forward.  Okay, that's it. Thanks.
Vincent Yu : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of  from CICC. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst : Thanks management for taking my questions. And congrats on your strong performance. We noticed that the absolute value of sales and marketing expenses have declined sequentially. Can you please comment on any marketing and promotion trends in the second half of this year? Thank you.

At the same time, we will leverage the advantage of our platform and conduct performance-based marketing on third-party platforms with premium content to establish our brand as professional medical aesthetics platform. For the full year, we forecast that sales and marketing expense as a percentage of our revenues will remain largely stable at no more than 50%. That's all. Thank you.
