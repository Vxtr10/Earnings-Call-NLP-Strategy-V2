Rick Hermanns: Thank you for joining us. For the third quarter, we experienced a modest stabilizing of the temporary employment market against the backdrop of continued uncertainty driven almost entirely by the global pandemic. By design, we created our franchising business model with the distinct purpose to be able to weather economic cycles. And over the last two quarters, it has proven to withstand the fallout from a once-in-a-generation pandemic. Make no mistake, this is a serious challenge to the operations of our franchises as construction, retail, concerts, sporting events and many other areas of the broader economy, which drove temporary staffing opportunities, have significantly decreased or stopped altogether. But our franchisees have moved quickly and judiciously to adjust staffing levels and associated expenses to help navigate these unprecedented times. The PPP loans were a key to this effort. And for HireQuest itself, while we have been challenged, we again delivered profitability and cash flow in the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, we initiated a quarterly dividend, and we are increasingly confident that the worst is behind us. Collectively, our third quarter franchisees system-wide sales were down 25% over the same period last year. However, the decline slowed during the third quarter, and we are encouraged by the franchisees resiliency and the swift actions that they are taking to adjust their cost structures with the realities of the current economic climate. To date, all of our franchises remain operational, and we have had no business failures. Our third quarter is typically our strongest quarter, and this year is no different with revenue of $3.4 million, up marginally compared to $3.3 million in the year ago quarter and $2.9 million in the prior quarter despite challenging economic conditions. While we believe the industry sectors our franchisees serve are stabilizing, we don’t expect a more robust recovery into leisure, hospitality and construction return to more normalized levels. The recent encouraging news from Pfizer regarding their vaccine candidate gives us increased optimism that we could see full stadiums again in the next year. For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $0.15 per diluted share and have generated nearly $6.7 million in operating cash flow from continuing operations through the first 9 months of 2020. Our balance sheet remains healthy and with no debt to service and positive cash flow generation.
Cory Smith: Thank you, Rick and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. Total revenue in the third quarter of 2020 was $3.4 million compared to $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 2.7%, which was primarily due to higher franchisee royalties. Our total revenue is made up of 2 components: franchise royalties, which make up roughly 90% of total revenue; and service revenue. Franchise royalties in the third quarter of 2020 were $3.2 million compared to $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 2.5%. This increase may seem counterintuitive, given the negative impact COVID-19 has had on our system-wide sales, the reason we saw this increase in franchise royalties is due to the handful of locations that were still company-owned after the merger in the third quarter of last year, which are currently reported as discontinued operations. All of these company-owned locations, with the exception of the California-based locations, which were sold, were subsequently converted to franchisees at the very beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019. Approximately $681,000 of our royalty revenue was attributable to branches acquired in the merger that had already, became franchisees.
Operator: Thank you.  We will take our first question from Aaron Edelheit with Mindset Capital. Please go ahead.
Aaron Edelheit: Hi, thanks and great quarter. I had two questions. The first question was can – if we get a vaccine, like the Pfizer vaccine and it’s effective and things kind of go back to normal. Could you talk about like how much of your business do you think would come back? Because I’m guessing most of your stadium, like cleanup and hospitality business is running pretty close to zero. I would imagine that you would have a pretty sharp snapback. That’s my first question. My second question is, was there anything – your operating margins, which are normally quite high, seem really high in this quarter. And I am just wondering were there any special factors that your operating margin was so high this quarter? Thanks.
Rick Hermanns: Yes. Thank you, Aaron. So to answer the first question is realistically, throughout the quarter, our revenues, as discussed in the last earnings call, we were running around the – basically about 27% to 30% behind the comp period of the prior year. By the end of this quarter, we were down to about low 20s, so 21%, 22% less than the prior year, probably almost 100% of that is due to leisure, hospitality and similar businesses. So to your point, is – provided the Pfizer or the similar vaccines become widely available and as effective as purported, I would expect that we would go back to similar revenues or system-wide sales of 2019. There’s – we are, as you said, and your assumption is correct, we’re running at extraordinarily low levels as far as auto auctions and arenas and stadiums, and those are fairly significant contributors for us. And again, those are virtually nonexistent right now. So that’s a good question. And again, once you see – and I said this in the last quarter, once you see stadiums full again, that will have a significant increase, you should – and significantly increase our revenues. As far as the second question, the – and I am going to leave this to Cory to correct me if I’m wrong, but my guess is the main reason for the increase in the operating margin is due to the workers’ comp, which is sort of our – basically the performance of our workers’ comp book. As time goes on, we expect that to improve as our workers’ comp experience becomes more seasoned. And to give a little more color to that is basically when we did the merger, there was – we did not pick up any of the old experience from HireQuest. And as a result, our results for the last 15 months have basically only included sort of new workers’ comp claims. And new workers’ comp claims tend to be more heavily reserved. But as time moves on, we would expect some relaxation of that. And I think that, that’s part of what you saw probably in the – that’s what we saw in the third quarter. And the improvement also was partially – the second quarter still contained a lot of – also contained – first of all, lower sales. And also, we still had – some of the major cuts that we made were in – were as late as in the end of April. And so they really didn’t fully flush out until the third quarter.
Aaron Edelheit: Okay. Well, great. I mean, I am just looking at close to a 60% operating margin, and that’s pretty phenomenal. Thank you for the explanation.
Rick Hermanns: Thank you.
Operator:  We will take our next question from David Lavigne with Trickle Research. Please go ahead.
David Lavigne: Hi, all. You have done a fantastic job. This is a really good quarter, I mean all things considered. So can you give us some sense sort of along the lines of the last question, but can you give us some sense of what maybe normalized SG&A will look like going forward then? Because I think the operating margin was really a function of that. I mean just sort of trying to get my arms around, I don’t know, some kind of range or something to expect. It’s been sort of all over the place, though.
Rick Hermanns: David, thank you for the question. So what I would say is more – and this is on our sort of investor deck, on our website. But in the longer term, our target is more from, I would say, from a net margin standpoint, as it relates to system-wide sales, is to fall somewhere between 3.75% and 4.25% of system-wide sales. And again, workers’ comp can swing and things like that. And the difficulty is the margins seem like they swing more when they’re shown as a percentage of revenues, which, of course, the revenues mostly just represent royalties. When you compare them to system-wide sales, those SG&A expenses and other operating expenses are a lot more stable. Because the problem is that we only have $3.4 million worth of revenues in a quarter, if you have a $200,000 swing in workers’ comp, it seems like a really big deal. But when you take that $200,000 compared to $60 million, $55 million worth of system-wide sales, the $200,000 is nothing. And that – so I would encourage you, even as you look at it, to really look at it more as a percentage of system-wide sales. It gives you a better sense of really – it – because actually, the beauty of our model is we really are very stable, not unstable. And so, but again, to get that sense, you really have to look at the system-wide sales. I don’t know if that answers your question, but I would really advise that.
David Lavigne: Yes. That answers my question. It doesn’t make the modeling any easier, but that answers my question though. That’s good. Appreciate it. Thanks. 
Rick Hermanns: Sure.
Operator:  And there appear to be no further questions at this time.
Rick Hermanns: Great. Well, I thank everybody for joining us today. I thank you for your continued support of the company. I think there are a lot of really good things happening. Again, as the markets have reacted over the last week with the Pfizer vaccine, I am very hopeful that – and more confident that there’s at least now a bright light at the end of the tunnel. And I would also just reiterate that it’s really good news as well that all of our franchisees have made it through this period, and – which really sets us up for the future as leisure and hospitality, as that business snaps back that we’re in a great position to capture back the business that was lost due to the COVID-19. We are in a great spot for it. And then I would also say that as we put a little bit more distance behind us from the – basically from March is we’re starting to see more acquisition opportunities because I think it’s become more clear, sort of where the economy is likely to end and/or at least settle in at, the election uncertainty is over. Mostly over, I guess the – and that’s all helpful as well as far as getting sellers to come to realistic prices. And so we are hopeful that again that viable acquisitions will be available to us in the near future. And so again, thank you for joining us and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a great day."
