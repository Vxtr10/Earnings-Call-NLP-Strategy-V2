All figures discussed today on today's call are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.I'll now turn the call over to Sharon Driscoll. Sharon?
Sharon Driscoll: Sure. Thank you, Zaheed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Our solid results in the quarter reflect continued progress against our strategy to provide multichannel solutions for buyers and sellers in all segments of the used equipment market.We are very pleased with the progress on our strategic initiatives and particularly with the performance in our U.S. region and with our global online growth. We continue to make good progress in the quarter with our MARS implementation and our RB Asset Solutions products and services, along with our Marketplace-E solution is resonating very well with customers.This quarter highlights the solid execution by our sales and operations teams to deliver positive results for our consignors, particularly at a time when global markets faced heightened economic and political pressures.Before we jump into the quarter, I want to take this opportunity on behalf of both Carl and I to thank all of our team members globally, for their tremendous energy and commitment in the quarter to deliver these results.We delivered 18% total revenue growth, with a 28% improvement in adjusted diluted earnings per share and generated greater than 200% improvement in our operating free cash flow. These results were led by the strength of our 5% GTV volume growth on a constant-currency basis and stronger guaranteed contract rate performance and fee revenues, which contributed to our 11% service revenue growth in the quarter.Our online GTV had robust growth of 37% led by Marketplace-E delivering another tremendous quarter of growth, up 56% over last year along with strong IronPlanet weekly auction and over 120% growth in GovPlanet.Another highlight in the quarter was the great work from our Ritchie Bros. Financial Services team, which produced its 31st consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth at a very strong 29%.Our results were unfavorably impacted by a 3% GTV decline in our Live Auction channel and lower year-over-year inventory profit rate performance. The Live Auction GTV decline was driven by a few factors: first, a shift in our Moerdijk Netherlands auction to Q2 of this year coupled with challenging environments within the global agriculture and energy sectors.Regionally, our U.S. team had an impressive quarter delivering double-digit total GTV growth led by strong online performances from each of Marketplace-E, IronPlanet weekly and GovPlanet together with high single-digit growth in live industrial auctions. The headline story for our Canadian business was slightly less positive, as we experienced GTV decline resulting primarily from the weakness in the agriculture sector and general uncertainty for industrial consignors, primarily Western Canada leading into the federal election.The agriculture weakness was driven by lower ag commodity prices, international trade uncertainty and unfavorable weather affecting harvest timing and leading to a deferral of equipment consignments. All in, we held 13 fewer on-the-farm auctions in Canada versus last year's third quarter and saw softer agriculture performance at our live events. Notably however, we are already seeing a more positive story unfold and good early momentum in Q4 with booked volumes from on the farm auctions significantly up over last year.GTV in our international group declined in the quarter and was heavily impacted by the decline in the euro versus the U.S. dollar. Excluding the significant unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, international was flat till last year despite the shift of the Moerdijk auction into the second quarter and the softness in the Middle East.Finally, our international group posted another strong Marketplace-E performance with GTV growth in the quarter up 148%. I wanted to add that our operational metrics remain strong and we are encouraged by our increases in the number of listed items and total number of overall bidders.And overall in the market, as it relates to construction equipment supply, OEM production levels appear to have caught up to new equipment demand and large strategic accounts are shifting their focus towards inventory management, which could indicate further loosening of equipment supply in the near to midterm.Additionally, in the transportation sector, we have seen more assets come to market and coupled with some weakness in demand has led to pricing pressure on those assets in certain markets. The impacts to supply will vary by geography as consigners navigate such factors as the U.S.-China trade deal, Brexit, the results of the federal elections in Canada and a moderating economy in the U.S.Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about the used equipment supply. And as we have said in the past, we do not expect to see a lot of equipment all at once, but more a general improvement as we go into Q4 in 2020. We are collectively focused on keeping the momentum going as we drive our business forward and stay focused on our long-term growth initiatives.I will now turn to the financial highlights. Our total revenue improvements of 18% was driven by both a 32% growth in inventory sales revenue and an 11% increase in service revenue. Commission revenues increased 4% in line with GTV growth and strong guaranteed contract rate performance. Fee revenues were up 19% in the quarter as a result of higher GTV volume, the impact of our fee harmonization and a higher mix of lower value lots. RBFS also contributed to fee revenue growth in the quarter with their strong performance. The 32% growth in revenue from inventory sales was primarily due to a higher level of inventory deals transacted in the U.S. region and GovPlanet inventory sales revenue from our government surplus contracts.Our operating income on an adjusted basis excluding the onetime severance costs related to acquisition synergy actions in the third quarter of last year was up 23% driven by our total revenue growth and operating leverage with our SG&A growth costs growing at about half the rate of service revenue growth. Net income on an adjusted basis, which excludes the non-operating gain on the sale of an equity investment in Q3 of last year, improved 31% from both higher operating income and lower interest expenses.Turning to our Auctions and Marketplaces segment, service revenue was up 12% in the quarter. Regionally, the U.S. posted 90% service revenue growth, led by strong live and online GTV growth, including higher volume from our strategic accounts, strong growth from GovPlanet as well as higher fee revenues. Canada was up 2% on higher fee revenue from the fee harmonization and increase in lower value lots, resulting in higher per lot fee rates and a 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in our guarantee commissions rate from our industrial live auctions. This was partially offset by the significantly lower activity in the Canadian agriculture sector as mentioned earlier in my comments.Our international service revenue decreased 3% due to the Moerdijk auction shift, softer performance at our Dubai auction, partially offset by higher commissions earned from online GTV growth. On a rate basis, we were pleased with our A&M service revenue rate performance in the second quarter coming in at 13.8%, roughly 90 basis points higher than last year. The rate improvement was due to strong guarantee commission rate performance in both Canada and GovPlanet and in conjunction with fee revenue growth.Moving on to our Auctions and Marketplaces segment inventory sales revenue, the 32% growth in our inventory sales revenue was led by the U.S. region, which was up 106% over last year, primarily driven by the continued growth of GovPlanet surplus contract and increased inventory contracts at the live on-site auctions. As well we have seen a slight increase in distressed sale transactions and early signs of defleeting by some large strategic accounts in both the construction and transportation sectors. Our Canadian inventory sales revenue increased 11% primarily due to a large equipment dispersals in the west during the quarter.Our international region was up 2% from increased inventory contracts in Japan and in Australia. On a rate basis, our implied rate of return on inventory deals in the quarter was 8% which was roughly a 250 basis point sequential improvement from Q2 levels. The sequential increase in our rate was driven by disciplined inventory deal management as our sales and valuation teams navigated a very fluid pricing environment. This increase was partially offset by some trailing effects from the remaining lower rate inventory in our international market, which was anticipated and which has now been fully sold through. Overall, we are encouraged with our sequential inventory rate improvement and strong rate performance from our guarantee contracts delivering at-risk rate performance which remains in line with historical levels and our expectations.Moving on to SG&A expenses. We continue to prioritize our cost initiatives. The 6% increase in SG&A over the prior year quarter was mainly driven by higher year-over-year incentive compensation due to improved financial results. Excluding this impact, SG&A was only up low single-digits compared to service revenue growth of 11%.Ongoing incremental GovPlanet costs, investments in RBFS growth and the positive impact of foreign exchange fluctuations due to the devaluation in the euro and the Canadian dollar also affected our SG&A. We are pleased with our overall sales force productivity, which on a trailing 12-month basis was up 5% year-over-year in the third quarter.Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity metrics. Our operating cash flow of $309.1 million for the nine months ended September 30 improved to 218% over last year. The improvement was driven by higher net income and improvements in working capital, primarily resulting from a decrease in inventory balances.Additionally, cash flow this quarter was favorably affected by the timing of auctions closer to the end of the quarter and the corresponding timing of receipts and disbursements. On a trailing 12-month basis, our operating free cash flow increased 214% to $334.4 million.Our year-to-date CapEx spend of $25 million is currently tracking under our full year range for 2019 of $45 million to $55 million. And with one quarter remaining, we are now adjusting our full year 2019 CapEx guidance down to be between $35 million to $40 million.During the quarter, we continued to reduce our long-term debt position with additional voluntary payments of $10 million along with a $4.5 million scheduled repayment. Our strong cash position, the reduction in debt as well as a 17% increase in adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis has resulted in an adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times on a trailing 12-month basis, which continues to be well below our evergreen target of less than 2.5times. On a trailing 12-month basis our ROIC increased to 8.6%, up from 7.1% in the third quarter of 2018.Our overall financial position remains in very good health. Our clear strategic focus strong, leadership across our business and a solid balance sheet give us continued confidence for the future.And with that, I'll now pass the call over to Karl.
Karl Werner: Thank you, Sharon, and good morning everyone. To begin, I'd like to echo Sharon's comments and highlight our U.S. regions strong performance delivering solid positive growth across both live and online channels. As discussed, our third quarter live auctions were unfavorably impacted by the agriculture and energy sectors.Keeping that in mind that that last year's energy comp is a tough one to follow us we had a major event with a large single customer dispersal. The shift to [indiscernible] foreign exchange, lower Middle East performance and trade concerns affecting exports to various markets have also affected our international business. While these factors affected our live auction performance this quarter, we take them and describe because issues were not structural. They were either market-driven and/or timing related and are not indicative of our team's live auction execution in the quarter.In fact when looking at our live auction comp performance. These issues did not affect the U.S. region which posted high single-digit live GTV growth and 58% of our auctions globally delivered solid wide comps.To name just a few of the standouts; Edmonton was up 27%; Orlando was up 54%; Qigong [ph] Australia up 36%; Sacramento up 19% in Atlanta, Los Angeles up 42% and 30% respectively.I'd also be remiss if I did not mention our fantastic execution and record-breaking $77 million live auction in Houston earlier this week. As mentioned we are seeing some of the same of equipment which contributed to our overall unit growth with the U.S. driving a significant share of that. Particularly offsetting the unit growth with some price declines in older high hour heavy equipment and transportation categories.Before I move on to online commentary, I'd like to share some insights on priority bidding tool which we launched in the quarter. Priority bid will replace our current RB Prebid function which allows customers to place online bids up to a week before the event.With priority bid already in use and IronPlanet, this will give our customers a more consistent experience across platforms and allow customers more opportunity to place bids more often and provides us with insights into how item and categories may perform before the live auction. This also opens potential opportunities for marketing to intervene through direct campaigns if there are concerns of items underperforming.Turning to online performance. We had a strong quarter of online growth across all channels. 67% of our GTV was purchased by online buyers in Q3 versus 60% last year, in line with our overall improving supply environment. We also saw strong incremental volumes through IronPlanet weekly including contributions from our large strategic accounts.One of our growth initiatives is Marketplace-E solution. Our objective here is to drive penetration of the midstream segment which we discussed previously as part of our strategic roadmap.Our rapidly growing Marketplace-E Offers consigners complete control over pricing, time of disposition through a variety of unreserved formats. Marketplace-E offers consigners an alternative to selling their own or using brokers -- selling on their own or use of brokers and by achieving strong prices value through leveraging the RD platforms, our global reach and network effects.We officially launched Marketplace-E in January of 2018. Since inception, marketplace has surpassed the $5 million mark in GTB. Marketplace-E has momentum right now and is fully embraced by our sales team as another capability to serve our customers' needs, particularly those seeking control over every reserve platform.With Marketplace-E we are now attracting customers which in the past have not transacted with us. In fact through our customer data, we are seeing approximately 60% of our sellers on Marketplace-E and the last year have been new sellers to RBA or IronPlanet indicating that the channel is driving incremental new business.Marketplace is also giving us a beachhead for any new international markets in an asset-light format and markets where there isn't the same level of comfort with an unreserved platform.We are pleased with early strong momentum we are seeing and we'll continue to focus on scaling business attracting new customers as well as growing share of wallet with existing customers to capitalize on significant market – market share opportunities within the midstream segment.Turning now to our areas of focus in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged with the momentum we are seeing in our business. Over the last two quarters, we remain acutely focused on executing our priorities as we move in the fourth quarter and into 2020. We are focused on what we control and that starts with sales execution, leveraging our multi-channel platforms, and driving overall sales productivity improvement.Our sales effectiveness initiative called SAGE, was launched in Q2 and has now been fully cascaded to our sales teams, while they still take a few quarters to see real tangible outcomes. We are already encouraged by early signs of engagement and adoption. We remain firmly committed to our key growth drivers of expanding our base live and online auction businesses and accelerating our growth initiatives, including Marketplace-E, RB Asset Solutions, Ritchie Brother Financial Services, growing our priority international markets and our government business.Together with Sharon and the entire executive team, we have been committed to focusing on our people, our customers, and ensuring there's a high level of support and engagement as we progress through the CEO transition. Priority one, right now is to ensure this transition process is seamless as possible, while allowing our teams to stay focused on our business and be fully empowered to do the best each day.We've been in auction business for over 60 years. We've seen many inflections in cycles come and go. It's times like these where our determination shows and that is when our customers consider the implications of possible economic slowdown, they turn to a seat council on disposition options, timing and strategies. That is where we excel. That is where trust, experience become the biggest asset position as well to support both buyers and sellers apart from driving into – with our absolute best levels of service and commitment to continuously improve overall experiences.Finally, we will continue to be focused on our expense discipline and driving incremental leverage into our business, while maximizing our cash efficiency and operating free cash flow.With that, let me turn the call back to Sharon to close this out.
Sharon Driscoll: Thank you, Karl. So to recap, we are pleased that the execution of our multi-channel strategy is showing positive results and with just one quick comment on Karl's remarks. That we have seen in the two years since its inception with Marketplace-E over $500 million of GTV transacted on that form. And that we have delivered strong financial performance across all of our core metrics of GTV, revenue, operating income, earnings per share. We also continue to make great strides towards achieving our evergreen model targets. Our online acceleration this quarter was very strong and with all of our core solutions of IronPlanet weekly Marketplace-E and GovPlanet posting positive growth.Our U.S. team delivered a solid performance with positive live and online GTV and very strong revenue growth. We continue to be very disciplined and are pleased with the strength of our balance sheet and our positive cash flow generation.Finally, we are very encouraged with the continued momentum in our business and confident our multichannel strategy positions us well for continued growth and value creation. At the end of the day this is a people business. And we would like to thank our entire team for their energy and passion for serving our customers and driving value for our shareholders.And with that, we are ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please open the line to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities. Your line is open.
Cherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask about what feels like an ongoing shift to lower value lots. Just curious whether that's principally the influence of GovplaNet? Or whether that's a trend that you're also seeing across the live auctions and online marketplaces?
Sharon Driscoll: Hi, Cherilyn it's Sharon. I'll take that. So certainly GovPlanet is the impact that is a channel that has very low item prices. So that's very similar to our tow auctions at our live events. But we equally are still seeing, the age of equipment is still tending to the lower -- not later models but it's not in our sweet spot the way we would like it to be. So that is also having an effect. So it is being seen in our live events as well. And as we again continue to expand our capabilities in that small sector and in transportation, we do start to see downward pressure on our average sale price per lot.
Cherilyn Radbourne: And how do you feel about that strategically? Because I understand that lower value items attract higher fees and that's positive for the revenue rate. But I assume that there's also more competition to sell lower value items versus higher value items?
Karl Werner: Hey, Cherilyn, this is Karl. We get a lot of those in packages of equipment. So mix constantly changes. It's a balance for us. And we don't see -- the competition is mainly on the large packages and those are just a component of those.
Cherilyn Radbourne: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on SG&A, you had some nice leverage there this quarter. Just wondering whether there was anything we should be mindful of as we model like lower stock-based compensation or anything of that nature?
Sharon Driscoll: So no we were very pleased with the discipline that the teams showed in our SG&A spending. It's clearly things like travel and promotional costs were very well-managed in the quarter. The compensation expense is the primary driver of what you're seeing in Q3 is really related to variable based performance where we are seeing strong performance in our financial results compared to where we were last year.So I don't think there's anything particularly unusual for you to be considering. I do probably just would call out that there is currently a positive foreign exchange impact on our SG&A as we translate our international and Canadian offices into U.S. dollar currencies.
Cherilyn Radbourne: Thank you. Those are my questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Derek Spronck of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Derek Spronck: Okay. Thank you for taking my question. It was another quarter of pretty high inventory sales. Do you think this is going to be more of the trend going forward here? And the margins seem to be a little bit more compressed than it has been historically. Is that correct? And if so, are there any levers that you can pull to maybe change that dynamic?
Sharon Driscoll: Sure. So I'll tackle that. So we're somewhat agnostic to the form at which our contracts are written. And it really is up to consign or demand in terms of whether or not we take something as a Straight commission, a guaranteed commission contract or an inventory position. The things that will cause inventory to fluctuate positively will be increases in insolvency transactions, increases in our international business, because those are the areas that really where you do need to take title to the assets to basically complete those transactions.So I think unfortunately this is the new accounting standard. So you see the variability which is why we've been recommending that from a revenue standpoint the performance of our service revenue line is more indicative of our overall growth and health of our business because there will continue to be variability in those -- in that revenue from inventory sales. And it does come with commensurate cost of good sold that will offset any increases in revenue that you see from that loan.
Derek Spronck: Okay. That makes sense. Are you happy with the margin profile though of that business?
Sharon Driscoll: Yeah. So again the margin profile is only part of the story. We do earn fees and other service revenues and those don't show up in that pure gross profit measure that you're really seeing on the face of the statements. Overall, if we go back to our overall at-risk performance, we are very much in line with our historical levels. And clearly, on our expectations with respect to both performance of inventory contracts and our guarantee contracts. So we're very pleased, particularly in light of -- right now what we're seeing is a very fluid and dynamic pricing environment and our teams have done a very good job of ensuring they're looking forward to where prices are going to be as we price out those at-risk contracts.
Derek Spronck: Okay. No that makes sense. Thanks, Sharon. And just one more for myself if I could and then I'll turn it over. There's been obviously multiple different areas and segments that are delivering growth. Are there any particular areas or segments that you are most optimistic about in terms of providing growth over the next one to two years?
Sharon Driscoll: So I think we're very encouraged with what we see in the U.S. and that really has been a tailwind for us for the last few years which is just related to equipment supply. So I'd say that that -- clearly what we're seeing in the quarter and the discussions that the U.S. team and the sales teams are having with their customers give us some degree of comfort that the current trend may not continue at that rate, but it actually looks like those tailwinds to supply have really abated. So we are quite keen on the progress that the U.S. team has made. And in addition the two key drivers of performance being our SAGE sales kind of effectiveness program and Marketplace-E, we're really pleased with how we're seeing that particularly the U.S. team adopting those concepts to provide better value to our consignors as well as improve our overall sales productivity with that force.
Derek Spronck: Okay. Thanks, Sharon.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Ben Cherniavsky of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Ben Cherniavsky: Good morning guys. Sorry I'm still trying to completely understand the different revenue reporting that's changed since you -- since the accounting policies were changing. You couldn't just report it in a simpler fashion the way you used to. So the -- when I look at the other revenue that you reported, does that all fall into the fee bucket? Is all other revenue or fees – what -- or ask another way what exactly does that represent the other revenue?
Sharon Driscoll: So, yes. So I assume you're referring to the other segment or the other classification which is made up of other segments. So what's predominantly in there is, Ritchie Bros. Financial Services, Mascus which is listing fee revenues and hosting fee revenues in RBAS, as well as ancillary and refurb-type revenues that are related to the equipment that comes into the transaction -- transactional site, but is not related to the auction.So what you would have seen as we've got very good growth in Ritchie Bros. Financial Services, we see -- are seeing some good growth in Mascus and RBAS, but a lot of the inventory that we sold through this quarter, the work that had been done on that for refurb, paints etcetera have been done in prior quarters. So you're seeing some declines in those ancillary revenue bucket purely because of timing and when network has performed.
Ben Cherniavsky: But it's all -- but that is all classified as -- none of that is commissioned right, that all fall -- all the other revenue as you described, it would be fee based revenue?
Sharon Driscoll: Yes, it's all in the fee bucket.
Ben Cherniavsky: And other services include Ritchie Brothers, fee RBAS, right?
Sharon Driscoll: Yes. Mascus, Logistics…
Karl Werner: Logistics, refurbishers.
Sharon Driscoll: Asset Class, Services group. It's a mix of a lot of service-related fees that we actually do outside of our auction fee structures.
Ben Cherniavsky: Right. I guess what I'm trying to back in to here Sharon is, what the -- because I know there's also been some fee harmonization. And I'm trying to figure out how material that was in the quarter or year-to-date?
Sharon Driscoll: So the fee -- yes so the fee harmonization is not in the other sector. It's in auction and marketplaces fee structure. And it was a large driver of total fee growth of 19%. And the two real factors, the current year harmonization, but also what we're seeing is this increase in small lots that you're getting year-over-year benefit not just from this year's harmonization, but the fee implementation from last year.And to build on Cherilyn's point, those fees are essential for us to be able to make money on those small lots and make it more - make it a more viable kind of part of our solution and it is definitely working. And without having impact to what we see as price realization rates or impact to our customers.
Ben Cherniavsky: Right. So you're saying that there's also a mix component to it. As the loss gets smaller and you start imposing fees that aren't imposed on larger lots. And that will drive some of that revenue growth.
Sharon Driscoll: I would put it a bit differently, Ben. I think it's just -- because on small lots, they don't hit the cap, so as a result the percentage of the GTV ends up higher on a rate basis, even though the dollars may actually be small on small lots is just they're not -- they just haven't hit the cap level.
Ben Cherniavsky: Right. Okay. And then, you did make one reference to the evergreen targets, but I realize you're in transition to some new leadership. And I don't know, maybe those will be revisited. But -- and then, I think, I've asked this in past quarters. ROIC improved, but you're still roughly half of what your target is in two years? Do you still think that's achievable 15% in 2021?
Sharon Driscoll: So, we do look at that. We've done our planning out. All our models indicate that evergreen target is still very much achievable through a combination of continued reduction in debt and earnings growth.
Ben Cherniavsky: Okay. Thanks very much for answering my question.
Operator: And that was our final question. I will now return the call to Mr. Mawani for final comments.
Zaheed Mawani: Thank you, Chris, and thank you to everyone for joining us on our third quarter call. And we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth protocol in the New Year. Have a great day everyone. Bye-bye. That concludes our call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
