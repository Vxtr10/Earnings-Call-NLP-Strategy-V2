"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Quarter 2021 ACCO Brands Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christine Hanneman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Christine Hanneman: Good morning. This is Christine Hanneman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Welcome to ACCO Brands first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Speaking on the call today are Boris Elisman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACCO Brands Corporation; and Neal Fenwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Slides that accompany this call have been posted to the Investor Relations section of accobrands.com. When speaking about our results, we may refer to adjusted results. Adjusted results exclude transaction, integration, amortization and restructuring costs and other nonrecurring items and reflect an adjusted tax rate. Schedules of adjusted results and other non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the earnings release and slides that accompany this call. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking non-GAAP measures. Beginning with the first quarter we changed the way we calculate and report adjusted non-GAAP results by excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets. Please see our press release for further explaining of this change. Forward-looking statements made during the call, including statements concerning the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company, are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management based on information available to us at the time the statements are made. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our earnings release and SEC filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. Our forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update them going forward. Following our prepared remarks, we will hold a Q&A session. Now I will turn the call over to Boris Elisman.
Boris Elisman: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I will spend the next few minutes highlighting key elements of our first quarter performance. Neal will follow me with more details on the quarter and provide additional comments on our bond and bank debt refinancing. Then, we'll take your questions. Overall, I'm very pleased with our first-quarter results and in particular, the performance of PowerA and the continued strength in EMEA. The 7% total company sales growth we performed better than we expected, despite comparing a COVID-19 affected quarter against a mostly pre-COVID-19 quarter, last year.
Neal Fenwick: Thank you, Boris. Good morning, everyone. As Boris mentioned, we saw the initial impact of COVID-19 hit our EMEA business minimally only in late March last year. So, this is the last quarter of comparing a COVID impacted quarter against one that wasn't impacted very much. Our first-quarter sales rose 7% as a result of the PowerA acquisition. Comparable sales declined approximately 13%. PowerA's sales were much stronger than we expected, coming in at $63 million, mostly in the North American segment, and this compared with pre-acquisition sales, last year, of approximately $31 million. We also continued to see strong sales growth in product lines that focus on work and play-from-home, such as our Kensington computer accessories, TruSens air purifiers, do-it-yourself, and are supplies. Sales to commercial channels remained weak and drove most of the comparable sales decline. Compared to 2020 and excluding PowerA, sales to commercial and B2B customers declined 18%, and retail and mass sales were down 7%. On the other hand, e-commerce sales rose 28%, while sales through tech-specialist channels rose 6%. First-quarter adjusted net income was $10 million or $0.10 per share versus $13 million or $0.14 per share last year. The year-over-year decline was mainly the result of lower volume in North America and International, higher incentive accruals and logistics expense, and higher interest expense associated with the acquisition, that is benefiting EPS for our cost reduction efforts and better profits in EMEA. Our reported profit was also negatively impacted by $14 million of other expense related to the bond and bank debt refinancing, and $7 million due to the earn-out portion of the PowerA purchase price. In addition, we had $4 million in restructuring charges, $1 million of pension curtailment charges, and $4 million increase in amortization charges, and $2 million inventory step up that are acquisition-related. You may recall, though the PowerA earn-out is payable in two equal installments over the next two years if certain sales and profit targets are met. As such, every quarter, we must reflect the fair value of the earn-out and recognize any change as an expense in our income statement. We expect that this will result in  charges throughout the two-year earn-out period as we forecast strong results for PowerA. This quarter we booked a $7 million expense, which along with the higher charges previously noted, resulted in a small reported operating loss for the total Company.
Operator:  Your first question is from the line of Chris McGinnis with Sidoti and Company.
Chris McGinnis: Hey. Good morning, Boris, Neal, Christine. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter. Can we just start with the strength of PowerA? Obviously up 100%. Can you just talk about, is that really just driven from the new consoles, and then maybe, can you break down the growth between North America and EMEA, and how is the EMEA integration going? Thanks.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Chris, thanks for the question. PowerA growth is driven by multiple factors. There is the overall growth in gaming and that's been accelerated by the introduction of new consoles released last year from Microsoft and Sony. So, that's part of it. The second part of it is just supply availability, chip availability. PowerA has done a great job managing their supply chain, so we have decent product availability and are able to deliver to our customers when some of our competitors, and including first-tier suppliers such as Sony and Microsoft, can't deliver to all of the demand. And rather, the third primary reason, the team in PowerA has done a great job servicing customers and taking share and increasing their lead. So for all those multiple reasons we saw tremendous growth of slightly over 100% during the quarter. The integration of PowerA is going well. We are in the midst of it right now. The plan is to transition from the services agreement with the seller by the end of the third quarter and be completely on our systems, and then we could get exclusively focused on further growth. Did I answer all your questions, Chris?
Chris McGinnis: Yes. I guess, just one more on that, just the growth in North America and EMEA, were they 100% or can you just maybe break that, I don't know if you can provide that ?
Boris Elisman: Yes, look, I don't have that detail with me. PowerA's business is 80% in North America. So, North America's definitely driven the majority of the growth. Although, EMEA has done well, it's a relatively small number.
Chris McGinnis: I appreciate it. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Gomes with Nobel Capital.
Joe Gomes: Good morning, Boris and Neal. Congratulations on the quarter, and again, thanks for taking my question.
Boris Elisman: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Gomes: So, I kind of wanted to follow up a little bit here on PowerA. You gave some guidance of increasing the expectation from 15% growth to 25% growth, but I mean if we look at what you just projected, Neal, you said for the fourth quarter of $50 million to $60 million, if you hit the top end of that, then you really are already at that 25% growth level, and 65% of PowerA sales are in the second half of the year. Are we just taking a more conservative stance here on PowerA growth or is there something else there that would kind of prevent you from putting out even a greater expectation for PowerA revenues for this year? Thank you.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Joe. So, there is nothing artificial in that number. The -- we certainly will strive to exceed it, obviously. We'll do as much as we can. The only thing you have to keep in mind is a couple of things. The compares will get much more difficult in the second half because there was significant growth last year due to people staying at home and gaming more. So that's one factor to consider. And the other factor to consider is supply. There may be a lot more demand out there, but that just can't be fulfilled because of the long lead times associated with supply. So, I think your math is largely correct. I think we are assuming some kind of supply constraints for the second half and there is a lot of uncertainty with what's going to happen in the second half. But if we are optimistic, then maybe, we'll do a little better.
Joe Gomes: Thank you.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research.
Kevin Steinke: Good morning.
Boris Elisman: Good morning, Kevin
Kevin Steinke: Yes. So, obviously, you talked about commercial office sales in North America continuing to be weak, but also 60% of US schools, they're now fully reopened. And I think in the past, you've tied kind of reopening of schools to maybe some eventual return to the office. So, I'm just wondering if there are any glimmers of recovery or hope in the commercial office sales in North America?
Boris Elisman: There certainly are glimmers of hope of recovery. We are definitely hearing a lot more companies scheduling dates for returns back to offices. We think a lot of companies will go back in the summer and early fall timeframe. And it will be enabled by schools being fully in-person as well. So, we think there is a recovery ahead of us. We think there is a -- definitely a sales upside ahead of us as things continue and  going to revert back or  take hold. But based on everything we're seeing in the marketplace and hearing from our customers, we do think that North America -- US especially, you know, Canada has some slightly different issues, but US, especially, is poised to go back to the office is a lot more  currently. And well, we do anticipate it's going to be a hybrid kind of arrangement. But certainly, we do expect more offices to be in-person than they are today.
Kevin Steinke: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. Thanks for taking the question.
Neal Fenwick: Thank you.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Hale Holden with Barclays.
Hale Holden: Good morning. I had two quick ones. Neal, I was wondering, given the growth in PowerA, if you are where you need to be for working capital or if there is further investment in the current quarter expected?
Neal Fenwick: Quick answer to that one, Hale, is: it's a seasonal business and so its strongest sales are in Q4, and therefore, as it seasonally grows in the year, we're going to see an increase in working capital. We were also doing our best to bring up our inventory levels of some of their products because of the chip issues that we're seeing in the supply chain. And so, for both reasons, we are quite happy to invest in PowerA's working capital.
Hale Holden: And that actually is my second question is that you alluded to the chip issues that maybe some of your competitors were having, and I was wondering if there is any risk to your sourcing there?
Neal Fenwick: It's why we've been modest about projecting too much growth in the second half for PowerA because of our end supply questions, and obviously, we expect to improve, our forecast will improve.
Hale Holden: Great, thank you very much.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Hale.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of William Reuter with Bank of America.
William Reuter: Good morning. My questions are, I guess, kind of two-part question on raw material inflation, as well as shipping inflation. So, I guess, do you have an estimate of the aggregate dollar impact of inflation across input costs as well as shipping? And then, how much of that's going to impact this year versus maybe some of it being delayed due to some hedging or for purchases contracting, switching, etc? Thanks.
Neal Fenwick: Yes. So, I think two different things. One, we're seeing live the shipping impacts. We saw that in Q1. And from a purchasing point of view, I think that's going to be a much bigger story from the rising costs that we're seeing for raw materials. To the point you mentioned, we do have contracts with building time delays and we have inventory that builds in recognition delays. And so, for both reasons, what we're going to see is an increasing impact of those costs on our business as the year runs on. And that's quite necessary for us to raise prices in the market to offset. And  you know, basic commodities, they are up significantly.
William Reuter: Yes. I guess, just on that point, I guess, do you expect that the second quarter is going to see much of that or really will we see the impacts of those in the third quarter and beyond?
Neal Fenwick: No, we're going to start to see cost impacts hit the P&L in the second quarter, and then, much more so in the third quarter and beyond.
William Reuter: Great. I'll pass it to others. Thank you.
Boris Elisman: And just to follow up on that a little bit, Bill. As Neal mentioned, we have raised prices in April in the US to offset that increased inflation. And we're going to be doing some of that in other countries. And also as Neal insinuated, as we go into the second half, we'll also be looking at that and if inflation continues to be high, we'll be raising prices again in the second half to offset the impact of inflation.
William Reuter: Thank you.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital.
Brad Thomas: Hi. Good morning, Neal and Boris. I got on a little bit late, so I apologize if you covered some of this, but I first want to touch on back-to-school and see if you could give -- so a little bit more color on how you were thinking about the split between 2Q and 3Q, and how you're thinking about that unfolding in the US this year?
Boris Elisman: Sure. So let me start. We're very optimistic about back-to-school, being 100% in-person, in the US. There was some uncertainty earlier in the year about how exactly it's going to break, but consensus is emerging and we're seeing that today we've 60% of the schools already being fully in-person. That come August, July, even when some schools start to go back-to-school, we feel very good that there'll be at 100% in-person. With that said, given with that back-to-school, buy orders are made pretty early in the season just given the length of the supply chain, and given the situation last year with -- where they had pretty poor back-to-school. And most retailers were conservative in their upfront purchases. And then we will chase supply when demand materializes early. We had a very good back-to-school sell-in last year. If you remember, North American sales were quite strong in Q2 of last year. So we think that from a relative standpoint sales will be -- sales in the end will be weaker than they would have been otherwise just because of the more conservative position that the customers are taking, plus some inventory overhang that someone will have from last year. So, we think there'll be some shift from Q2 probably to Q3. And there'll be more replenishment in Q3 and certainly that we saw last year, but probably, also that we will traditionally see. With all of that, we expect the sell-up to be up significantly. The industry estimates are anywhere from 5% to 25% higher than last year. And also, as Neal mentioned, despite some of these shifts, we do expect growth in North American sales in Q2 versus prior year.
Brad Thomas: That's very helpful, Boris. Thank you. And if I could add a follow-up on PowerA, certainly, a very exciting new product to bear business. Could you just give us, you know, what's your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about the medium-term, perhaps two-year to three-year revenue opportunity from PowerA? And how you think about the long-term opportunity for PowerA?
Boris Elisman: Well, this year, we said, we expect roughly 25% growth from PowerA. If you look at the forecasts from industry analysts, they project a 18% sales growth over the next few years for the gaming industry. So, I don't think it's unreasonable for us to expect that we will grow in the medium term, at least with the market. And from a inorganic standpoint, as we mentioned, over the last couple of quarters, we also think that that gives us a new leg for a potential inorganic growth as well. So, we think it's an exciting and important segment for us. We're happy to invest in it and hopefully, looking to continue to grow at the rates that we've been seeing.
Neal Fenwick: Yes, and also in the longer term, we do see geographic expansion is a big piece that we can add to that on top of the industry growth.
Brad Thomas: Wonderful. Thank you so much.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Brad.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Karru Martinson with Jefferies.
Karru Martinson: Good morning. Just following up on that. In terms of the new leg to invest in, where are you comfortable on your leverage? Or do you have to get down back to that 3.5 by -- by year-end to fund the investments, or how are you thinking about that?
Boris Elisman: To do something major, Karru, we would have to get down to that 3.5 times, at least, or lower. But we are comfortable doing small tuck-ins at the current level as long as they are strategically aligned and financially very prudent. And when I say small tuck-ins, I'm talking about $10 million or less. But, for a major investment of $50 million or more, we'd like to get to 3.5 times net leverage ratio.
Karru Martinson: Okay. And you guys referenced funding some growth initiatives for the second half, I was wondering is there any more color in terms of the size  of those investments, and what they're going behind, other than the PowerA supply issue concerns?
Boris Elisman: Yes, most of them will be our new product development and demand generation to support our growth. And the product development will be in the work-from-home, video gaming, computer accessories, art supplies, wellness, all of the areas that we are seeing strong demand in. And demand generation will be in the near term to support those but also support back-to-school in North America. So that's where the investments are going to go in.
Karru Martinson: Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Karru.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial.
Hamed Khorsand: Hey, good morning. So I just wanted to ask about back-to-school. Are you seeing any changes in the purchasing habits on the regional side as these schools are going back into the session? And what are your expectations on gross margin as you start to scale up and you go back to normalcy with back-to-school purchasing?
Boris Elisman: Hamed, it's difficult for us to say because right now, the increased demand from end-users will be in primarily service by the inventory that the customers already have. So, we haven't seen a significant replenishment cycle yet. That's still to come. So, it's difficult for me to give you any additional color on a regional basis. Beyond that, overall, we are seeing sell-through up for pretty much all of our customers in the US. And what was your second question, I'm sorry?
Neal Fenwick:  Margin, gross margin.
Hamed Khorsand: It was gross margin.
Boris Elisman: Yes, it's also a tough question to comment on, because certainly with scale, we would expect an expansion in gross margin, plus we think some of the -- hourly  absolute inventory accruals will be released as well as volume goes up. But on the other hand, we are seeing increased inflation, raw materials inflation, and we are seeing -- continuing to see logistics and freight inflation. So, how will those things offset each other? It's difficult for us to give you additional color on until we see a little bit more in the quarter.
Hamed Khorsand: Okay. Thank you.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Hamed.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.
Carla Casella: I'm wondering on the M&A front, if you're seeing any more opportunities out there as we come out of the pandemic? And then, if your success in PowerA has made your -- made you change the view for -- you might be interested on the M&A front more be it more tax versus the traditional business?
Boris Elisman: Yes, thanks for the question. There certainly is no shortage of M&A opportunities in the whole thing. As we've mentioned over the last few earnings calls, there's lots of things in play there, both because the pandemic has squeezed some players strategically, but also because the valuations there are relatively high. So, people want to monetize the opportunity. We have always thought that  agency would be interested -- interesting for us. We've looked at that for a while. Overall, our strategy doesn't change. It has to make sense strategically for the company in terms of distribution, brands, value add, etc. What else has to make a financial sense from an -- accretion for our shareholders. So, our strategy hasn't changed. As I mentioned in my previous answer, to do something big we have to deliver as well. We have plenty of work on our hand this year to drive organic growth in the business. We think we have lots of opportunity, but we are definitely open to other acquisitions if both strategic and financial criteria are met. And we have the balance sheet to do it.
Carla Casella: Great. Thank you.
Boris Elisman: Thanks so much.
Operator:  Your next question is from the line of Joe Gomes with Nobel Capital.
Joe Gomes: Thanks for taking the follow-up. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Boris, maybe you can give us a little bit more insight in some of the new product introductions that you're thinking about here or looking at? I know, previously you talked about humidifiers as a potential area of interest. Maybe you could expand a little bit more on that? Thank you.
Boris Elisman: Sure. In the wellness area, we're definitely looking to expand of the line. You mentioned that previously we talked about entering the humidifier space, that's definitely something we're looking at. We're also looking at more of a commercial delayed air purifiers. Today, our products are largely focused on the consumer space and the home space, but we think that there is a sustained need for air purification in the office environments as well, and small businesses, given the pandemic, and just the sensitivity to those topics. That's one big area of investment. Work-from-home products is another big area of investment. We think that the world will not go back to the pre-pandemic way of working. We think that because as people return, they will return largely to a hybrid type of situation with people working in the offices a few days a week and working from home a few days a week. So, we think there will be sustained need for work-at-home products. And that includes investments in additional docking solutions, both for traditional PCs as well as for Apple ecosystem, including iPads. Certainly, investments -- continued investments in PowerA and video gaming, and expanding that line. Neal mentioned for international expansion for mobile gaming in headsets, and to support other console introduction. And then the other big area for work-from-home is manual shredding. We think there's a huge opportunity there to introduce value products that actually work and don't break after a few months and also a line of storage products and organizational products for home. We mentioned the  and Cosy range that we introduced in EMEA, which is a big hit. And I think there's an opportunity to introduce that on a global basis. So, there's really not a shortage of ideas for us to invest in the product development. We think we have a great roadmap and I look forward to bringing those to our consumers.
Joe Gomes: Thank you, Boris.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Boris Elisman for closing remarks.
Boris Elisman: Thanks, Natalia. Thank you for your interest in ACCO Brands. To summarize, we're optimistic of our continued recovery throughout the rest of 2021. We're also very pleased with the performance of PowerA and EMEA and expect growth in both to continue. We remain confident about our future and our ability to continue to position the Company for growth, and improving returns for our shareholders. Have a great day and we'll talk to you next time. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes the first quarter 2021 ACCO Brands earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
