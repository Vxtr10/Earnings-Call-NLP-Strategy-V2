Sherry Bahrambeygui: Thank you, Michael and good day everyone. We hope you are all healthy and safe. Thanks for joining us today and for your interest in our company. We will be sharing the strong results from our fiscal second quarter and how we are continuing to build on the momentum we’ve developed as we cross the mid-point of fiscal 2021. Our adherence to the founding principles of this company has carried us through a myriad of continuing challenges brought on by COVID and its related effects. We remain vigilant in our unwavering commitment to the safety of our members and employees. The extensive protocols we implemented to provide a safe and healthy environment continues. For instance, we are providing global employees a paid time-off for vaccines, where and when available. Additionally, we continue to support our employees with bonus opportunities, benefits, and enhanced safety measures. Over the past year, the pandemic has challenged us in many ways. However, I believe it's only strengthened us as a team. It's incredible to watch our team address the short-term challenges while at the same time remaining focused on the long-term objectives we set for ourselves.
Michael McCleary: Thank you, Sherry. Good morning or afternoon to everyone and thanks for joining us today. Total revenues and net merchandise sales for the quarter were at $937.6 million and $898.4 million, respectively, representing increases of 3.4% and 3.1% over the comparable prior year period respectively. As a reminder, including the clubs we opened in Liberia, Costa Rica in June 2020 and Bogota, Colombia and December 2020. We ended this quarter with 47 warehouse clubs compared to 45 clubs at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our comparable net merchandise sales growth was 1.1% for the 13 weeks, ended February 28, 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations had a negative impact on both net merchandise and comparable net merchandise sales of approximately $27 million or 320 basis points and $26 million or 300 basis points respectively. By segment in Central America where we had 26 clubs at quarter end net merchandise sales increased 3.6% with a 2.4% increase in comparable net merchandise sales. Our Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua markets contributed approximately 300 basis points of positive impact to total comparable net merchandise sales. This contribution was partially offset by 140 basis points decrease coming from Panama and Costa Rica for club closures and currency devaluation contributed to the decreases in sales respectively. In the Caribbean region, where we had 13 clubs at quarter end, total net merchandise sales declined 0.6% while comparable net merchandise sales increased 0.8%. The Dominican Republic continued its stellar sales performance during the COVID-19 pandemic with double digit sales growth despite a significant foreign currency devaluation compared to the prior year period. In Trinidad, as mentioned on our previous earnings call, we began limiting temporarily and in line with our ability to source tradable currencies U.S shipments to that market during the first quarter because of the on-going U.S. dollar liquidity situation. Our reduction of U.S. shipments has adversely impacted sales and Trinidad were in line with that expectation, comparable net merchandise sales declined 10.7% in the second quarter. We were able to source a modest increase in tradable currencies during the second quarter compared to the first quarter and are working on multiple projects to increase sources of U.S. dollars, such as by exporting goods produced in Trinidad. Therefore, we began increasing our levels of imported merchandise in Trinidad towards the end of our second fiscal quarter. However, we expect similar albeit slightly moderated declines in sales in this market going forward, until we are able to establish more reliable sources of tradable currencies, and subsequently more important goods. While we are in the process of implementing more sustainable sources of U.S. dollars in Trinidad, our exposure to a potential devaluation of the Trinidad dollar may grow. Moving back to segment sales. In Colombia, where we had eight clubs opened during the quarter net merchandise sales increased 9.7% and comparable non merchandised sales decreased 4.5% positively contributing 120 basis points to total net merchandise sales but negatively impacting total comparable net merchandise sales by approximately 50 basis points. This comparable sales decline in Colombia is primarily attributable to sales transfers from our newly open warehouse club in Bogota in December of 2020. The impact of currency on total and comparable net merchandise sales in Colombia was significant at negative 4.3% and 3.8% respectively for the quarter. Currency devaluation continues to be a challenge in Colombia, but we're employing different approaches in an effort to mitigate the impacts. Such as sourcing of locally produced goods and actively managing our sales prices and foreign currency exposure there. Turning to gross margins, total gross margin on net merchandise sales came in at 16%, 130 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year. A 130 basis point increase was primarily driven by the liquidity premium we have priced into our imported merchandise in Trinidad and as a result of more focused merchandising strategies and inventory management, resulting in fewer markdowns. Total revenue margins increased to 17.8% of total revenues, an increase of 120 basis points versus the same period last year. This is the result of a higher gross margins of 130 basis points that I mentioned previously, partially offset by lower revenue margins from our casillero and marketplace business in the quarter of 10 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were 13% of total revenue, an increase of 70 basis points versus the same period last year. In total, SG&A expenses increased $10.1 million compared to the prior year. Warehouse club and other operations expenses contributed 40 basis points with the increase primarily due to the fact that our new clubs in Colombia and Costa Rica have not yet reached normalized sales levels and a special bonus to all non-management employees for phenomenal performance. General and administrative expenses contributed the other 30 basis points of the increase primarily due to investments to support our technology and talent development. Operating Income was $45 million, or 4.8% of total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $38.8 million, or 4.3% of total revenue for the same period last year. This reflects the increase in total revenue margin, primarily from net merchandise sales of 120 basis points partially offset by the 70 basis point decrease due to the leveraging of SG&A expenses over the comparable prior year period. Net interest expense increased $0.5 million for the second quarter, primarily due to higher average long term loan balances to fund our capital projects and draw downs on our short term lines of credit as part of our COVID-19 related efforts to secure cash. Other expenses of $0.3 million are primarily from the cost of converting Trinidad dollars into other tradable currencies, partially offset by gains from devaluation of the Jamaican dollar due to our U.S. dollar denominated cash reserves designated to fund the construction of our new Portmore Club. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 came in slightly higher than last year at 33.9% versus 33.1% a year ago, primarily related to changes in our uncertain income tax positions. In our Q1 fiscal 2021 earnings call, we added 4%. However, due to our strong results in the first half of fiscal 2021, we now expect the full fiscal year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 33% to 34%. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $28.2 million or $0.92 per diluted share compared to $25.6 million or $0.85 per diluted share in the pre-COVID comparable prior year period. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $187.8 million, an increase of $51 million versus the same period a year ago. From a cash flow perspective, the $59.3 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to decreases in working capital as our temporary extension of vendor terms negotiated as part of our initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic began expiring during the first half of the fiscal year. It is important to note that many of these extended vendor terms have or will continue to revert to pre-COVID terms through the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. However, as I have previously mentioned, we do expect to end the third quarter with longer average vendor terms than we had pre-COVID which will carry forward indefinitely. Also, as Sherry mentioned, we are increasing our inventory position, particularly in the non-foods categories such as electronics to meet increased demand and prepare for potential supply challenges in this area. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $3.4 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in investments in certificates of deposit of Trinidad dollars that we have on hand, while we work actively to convert these Trinidad dollars into U.S. dollars, as availability allows, offset by fewer construction expenditures. The $85.2 million change from cash provided by to cash used in financing activities is primarily the result of a net decrease in proceeds from long term debt and net repayments of short term borrowings. We continue to be vigilant about our cash position and ready to adapt to sudden changes in circumstances. While some uncertainty remains in our markets about the extent and duration of the pandemic, we have confidence in our ability to continue our operations successfully, while also continuing to invest in the future. During Q3 of this fiscal year, we have finished paying down the remaining short term lines of credit, which we had access to as part of our initial COVID-19 response in Q3 of last year. In closing, we are very pleased with where we stand halfway through the fiscal year. I am confident that the investments we are making in our future capabilities, combined with our on-going commitment to the principles of the six rights of merchandising will propel us into the future. I want to express my complete confidence in our team and that these investments in talent, real estate, and our digitally enabled omni-channel platform have positioned as well for continued growth. Thank you all for your support and engagement in our journey. And your long term investment in a growth horizon we believe will be strong for years to come. I will now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Operator, you may now start by taking our callers questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And our first question will come from Jon Braatz with Kansas City Capital. Please go ahead.
Jon Braatz: Good morning, Sherry and Mike.
Sherry Bahrambeygui: Good morning, Mike.
Jon Braatz: I just want to touch on a couple items. First of all, your G&A expenses were a little bit -- there was sort of a step up in spending in that area. Was there a new initiative or something new that generated that increase? It was rather significant, but was some new programs implemented in the quarter?
Michael McCleary: Jon, no, it's you know, basically, we've been talking all along about how we're ramping up our spending in both technology and in support of this in general above and beyond just the omni-channel initiatives, and then we're also investing in talent, but there's nothing specific I think, as we see the sales start to increase as a percentage of sales. We expect that would stabilize.
Jon Braatz: Okay.
Michael McCleary: But as far as dollar values, we're obviously continuing to invest in the organization on future growth.
Jon Braatz: Okay, okay.
Sherry Bahrambeygui: And Jon, materiality, it may not be so much but you did ask the question about new initiatives, and I’m not sure if it came through clearly that we have started with pharmacies in our club as well,a nd we're investing in additional services.
Jon Braatz: Okay, okay. Michael on the gross margin front the pricing actions in Trinidad, I think in the 10-Q drove a 90 basis point improvement in your gross margins in the consolidated gross margins. As you go forward, do you think you'll still have that similar type of impact as a result of pricing actions in Trinidad?
Michael McCleary: Well, I think we -- I think we said that was primarily from Trinidad. But yes, I mean, at this point, we're -- nothing's really changed on the ground, and we're maintaining that. I think I mentioned last quarter that the hope would be that eventually things stabilize, and the U.S. dollars start to flow again and would not be something that we would want to continue for the long term. But at this point, there's nothing changed that That would allow us to change that.
Jon Braatz: Okay. Okay. Thank you. And then Sherry, on the March sales, which I thought were very, very good. Easter was one week earlier this year than last year. Did that have any impact? Do you think that had any impact on the March sales this year?
Sherry Bahrambeygui: Yes, I do. But there's also closures that go with the holidays as well. So, it's difficult to evaluate exactly how that's going to shift in terms of April, but we are looking forward to April costs, just as we are lapping against a very aggressive March of last year, we’ll be lapping against an April where there were significant closures. And so, timing is distorting things when it comes to comps.
Jon Braatz: Yes. Okay. Okay. And then lastly, Sherry you talked a little bit about supply chain issues. And I think that's going to be a recurring theme we hear from a lot of companies this quarter. Are you seeing any improvement, any easing of some of those issues or is the sort of steady as you go so to speak?
Sherry Bahrambeygui: Well, the shortage of containers from Asia is a global issue, and that is on-going, but what we have done is we've become much stronger in our ability to source from alternative sources regionally, and we've done a really good job of being able to shorten the lead times and make sure that we are maintaining good in stock of those, those categories that we think our members are most seeking at this time. So, we are really vigilant about it. We're aware of the risk whether the pandemic has surges that are unexpected, and we know there are externalities that we can't control. But internally, we've been finding ways to be able to mitigate that risk to be able to source from alternative resources or sources, and also increase our efficiencies using the Costa Rica regional distribution center.
Jon Braatz: Okay, all right. All right. Thank you very much.
Sherry Bahrambeygui: Thank you, Jon.
Operator: The next question will come from Rodrigo Echagaray with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Rodrigo Echagaray: Thank you. Thanks for the call. A couple of questions from my side, the first one is related to the smaller format. It sounds like you are increasingly perhaps at the margin, being more optimistic around that format. Is there anything in particular that you could share in terms of returns, sales per square meter, anything that, that can help us understand a little bit more the financial metrics of that format? And then I'll make a follow up question later.
Sherry Bahrambeygui: Okay, so I don't believe that we share our sales per square footage of, of our clubs. And although we've had some small formats that have now exceeded a year, the fact that we continue to want to build on that approach should be a strong indication about our confidence in our ability to have a profitable and positive return on those investments. The smaller format has application for us in the company in both metropolitan areas, because of the shortage of land and the expense, as well as more outlying areas where we can broaden our reach of team members, where land is far less expensive. And so the threshold for our internal metric and our internal benchmarking is easier to achieve. So we look at each one on a case by case basis. And we have internal standards in terms of what we'd like to see by way of a return and what we expect to see before we greenlight any one of those projects. So we believe a small format has good application for our company. But everything is looked at on a case by case basis.
Rodrigo Echagaray: Got it? And now that you have an online offering in all stores, including I'm guessing the smaller format, does that mean that or is it too early to tell whether having that additional, extended catalog offering makes those smaller stores even more appealing because now perhaps you don't need to have as much space for a lot of big ticket items.
Sherry Bahrambeygui: That is clearly one of the opportunities that we have, by virtue of having built up our omni-channel capabilities to allow for strategic selection of what is carried on the shelves versus what is offered online. In addition to the strategic implementation of domestic distribution centers and regional distribution centers that allow us to continue to evaluate the best way to post merchandise and to get merchandise into the hands of our members at the lowest possible price. So the smaller format supported by omni-channel and supported by the right distribution system is an opportunity for us to be able to satisfy the needs of the members with less real estate costs, which is basically one of our greatest areas of expense in terms of capital commitments.
Rodrigo Echagaray: Got it. And on that subject, how do you -- do you charge for the delivery? How much on average? Or, what's the strategy they're in? Are you outsourcing the delivery? Like all the retailers in the region to third party logistics companies that are in charge the last mile and I guess perhaps as the as you learn about, customer behavior, and obviously what other retailers charge for delivery, especially places like Colombia, where there's more competition, do you foresee investments on the subsidy of those shipping fees at some point.
Sherry Bahrambeygui: With regard to delivery, we are seeing an increase of delivery as a proportion of our Click & Go business, which offers the alternative of curbside pickup versus delivery. At this time, we do not charge separately for delivery. We do outsource significantly the delivery services that are directly charged and paid for by the member by the third party. But we have huge variability amongst our different markets in terms of consumer demand and expectation. So as you said, for example, in Colombia, that is a market that behaves in a manner that expects delivery that uses delivery, that's willing to pay for delivery. And whatever the delivery charge is passed on directly to the member. We don't independently charge for delivery but we are also looking for ways to be able to see if we can provide delivery in a manner that's even more efficient than what's currently offered by third parties. But we're looking at that on a case by case, country by country basis depending on what we see the demand of the members are.
Rodrigo Echagaray: Got it. And just on the -- I guess on the P&L last question. On the P&L where would we see the expenses related to the shipping and delivery?
Michael McCleary: That will be a cost of goods sold. I can offset -- we can offset through revenue for anything that we're passing on. But as Sherry said, we're passing on 100% we're not subsidizing any delivery right now.
Rodrigo Echagaray: Got it. Alright, that's that's my last question. Thank you guys.
Sherry Bahrambeygui: It's our pleasure. Thank you, Rodrigo.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sherry Bahrambeygui for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, Ma'am.
Sherry Bahrambeygui: I just like to thank all of our investors and our dedicated employees for their work. They've done a tremendous job dealing with externalities that are beyond our control and taking control of important aspects of our business to make sure that we're continuing to perform well. And our top priority remains, keeping our members and our employees’ safe, so that we can continue to be an important resource for our PriceSmart members and the communities in which we operate. So thank you all and I wish you good health and safety until next quarter, and beyond.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
