"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Casey General Stores Q1 FY 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Bill Walljasper, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.
Bill Walljasper: Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss Casey's results for the first fiscal quarter ended July 31. I'm Bill Walljasper, Chief Financial Officer; Terry Handley, President and Chief Executive Officer is also here. Before we begin, I'll remind you that certain statements made by us during this investor call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include any statements related to our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, growth opportunities and performance improvements at our stores. There are a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements, which are described in our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC and available on our Web site. Any forward-looking statements made during this call reflects our current views as of today with respect to future events. And Casey disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We’ll take a few minutes to summarize the results of the first quarter then afterwards we will open it up for questions about our results and outlook. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.70 compared to $1.57 for the same quarter a year ago. The earnings increase was primarily due to a strong fuel margin environment and the gallon growth during the quarter. We also benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard involving share based awards. Despite a softening in the broader convenience and food service industries, same-store sales inside our stores were up in the mid-single digits compared to a year ago in the same period. EIBTDA for the quarter was up nearly 7% to 157.9 million. In the fuel category, lower retail fuel prices from a year ago, and an increase in miles driven benefited same-store gallons. Our fuel saver program also continued to perform well. This resulted in an increase in same-store gallons sold of 3.1% in the first quarter. While total gallons sold for the quarter rose nearly 7% to 536 million. The average retail price of fuel during this time was $2.14 per gallon, compared to $2.57 in the same quarter last year. Fuel margin was up about $0.02 per gallon from the first quarter of last year due to a decline in the wholesale cost of fuel and a favorable environment for renewal energy credits resulting in a fuel margin of $0.195 per gallon for the quarter. During this time, we sold approximately 17.9 million RINs at an average price of $0.82. This represented about $0.027per gallon benefit to the fuel margin. The amount of RINs sold in the quarter were elevated by a timing issue that was mentioned following our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. We normally sell RINs twice per month, roughly in the middle of the month and then again at the end of the month. Occasionally, a contract can shift by a day or two, moving it from one month to the next, which is what happened in this case. Currently, RINs are trading around $0.85 and $0.90. Total sales in the grocery and other merchandise category were up 7.5% to 566.2 million in the first quarter, same-store sales were up 4.7%. Same-store sales in the quarter fell short of our annual goal as we saw a deceleration in customer count especially towards the end of the quarter resulting in lower than expected sales. This was further magnified by poor weather in July, which is usually the strongest month of our first quarter. Sales across all major areas of the category showed mid-single digits same store sales growth compared to the same period a year ago. The average margin in the quarter was 31.6%, down about 100 basis points from a year ago. This was primarily due to an out-of-period adjustment that benefited the first quarter last fiscal year and a switch from producing and bagging our own ice to using the third-party for a new direct store delivery ice program. Gross profit dollars were up 4.4% in the overall category to 179.1 million. Given all the challenges in the quarter, we are pleased with continued gains we’re achieving in the category and expect to benefit from the continued rollout of our operational growth programs and acceleration of new store openings and major remodels throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. The prepared food and fountain category continued to perform well. Total sales were up over 9% to 243.7 million for the quarter. Same-store sales in the quarter were up 5.1%. Even though same-store sales results fell below our annual goal, our various growth programs are on track and continues to generate the same sales lift we have experienced in prior years. Sales fell below our expectations in our unchanged store base, which we believe was due in part to the softening in the overall convenience in food service industries that many of our publicly traded peers have recently reported. We plan on introducing some new promotional activity in the upcoming quarters to help offset the apparent tightening on consumer spending. Prepared food margin benefited from lower commodity prices in the quarter relative to a year ago, primarily from cheese and coffee. The average margin rose to 62.8% compared to 62.5% from the same quarter a year ago. Our average cost achieved is locked in through December 2016 at $1.86 per pound, compared to $1.89 per pound in the first quarter a year ago. Due to the sales increases and margin enhancement, we were able to lift gross profit dollars in the quarter nearly 10% to 153.1 million. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 10.8% to 292.1 million, in line with the expectations we had previously provided. The majority of the increase in the quarter was due to a rise in wages primarily related to operating 26 more stores this quarter compared to the same time period a year ago as well as from the expansion of our growth programs. Credit card fees in fuel expense were flat in the quarter. Store-level operating expenses for open stores not impacted by any of the growth programs were up approximately 5.4%. A majority of this was due to wage pressure related to rate increases in our market area. In past calls, we have been asked about the potential impact of the new minimum salary requirements for exempt employees that goes into effect on December 1. We estimate the impact of this new requirement over the 12 month following the effective date to be in the neighborhood of $10 million. However, we believe we will be able of offset this through price increases on select items. We have already seen a shift in pricing of our competitors on numerous key items. We will continue to monitor these changes and make adjustments accordingly. On the income statement, total revenue for the quarter was down nearly 4% to just under $2 billion due to a 17% decrease in the retail price of fuel on the first quarter last year offset by an increase in a number of stores in operation this quarter compared to the same period a year ago, and the additional rollout of more growth programs to our stores. The effective tax rate for the quarter was down 350 basis points from a year ago in the same period to 33.5%. This was primarily due to the adoption of the new accounting standard related to the tax treatment of share based compensation. The impact of this adoption in the quarter was approximately $3 million benefit to income tax expense. This will be an ongoing benefit depending upon continued share based awards in conjunction with stock price appreciation comparing the grant date to the vesting or exercise date. We now expect our effective tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35.5% for the fiscal year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong. At July 31, cash and cash equivalents were 189.5 million, up significantly from 75.8 million at the end of the fiscal year. Long-term debt net of current maturities were 872.4 million, up from fiscal year end due to additional debt we secured in May 2016. Shareholder equity rose to 1.1 billion, up 65.6 million from fiscal year end. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below two times which we believe is one of the lowest in the convenient store industry. We generated 161.3 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures for the quarter were 85.2 million compared to 100.1 million a year ago in the same period. We expect capital expenditures to increase as new store construction accelerates and we continue additional major remodels and replacement projects. As of the end of the first quarter, we did not open new store constructions; however, we currently have 39 new stores under construction and 72 sites under contract for future new builds. This is up over 40% from where we were a year ago at this time and we are continuing to work on accelerating our organic growth over the next several years. We’ve also seen an increase in acquisition opportunities recently, and will look to augment our organic growth with acquisitions. However, we will continue to remain disciplined in looking at future opportunities. At the end of the first quarter, we acquired three stores and have eight acquisition stores under contract to purchase. In addition to this activity we completed three replacement stores and six major remodels. Currently we have 22 replacement stores and 15 major remodels under construction. Our store count at the end of this quarter was 1,933. In addition to the unit growth we also converted 85 one occasions to a 24 hour format and 50 more stores to pizza delivery format this fiscal quarter. We plan on adding approximately 100 stores to the pizza delivery program by the end of the fiscal year and complete 100 major remodels. We currently have 1,012 stores that are 24 hour format, 494 stores that have -- deliver pizza and completed 364 major remodels. Lastly, our online ordering continuous to gain traction. Subsequent to the rollout in January, total downloads of our mobile app have exceeded 530,000 and continues to grow. And our pizza orders done online has risen approximately 7.5%. In conjunction with this the basket [indiscernible] of online order has increased and is now nearly 13% higher compared to the telephonic order. We believe the contribution will continue to grow as a number of downloads of our mobile app increases. That continues our review of the quarter. We will now take your question.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Chuck Cerankosky: Bill, can you talk a little bit about the traffic trends and may be compared to early in the quarter, weather in July and may be what you are looking at now second quarter to date?
Bill Walljasper: Yeah, the traffic trends that we saw Chuck, actually we saw a deceleration in the traffic throughout the quarter, and it really was impacted in July and we, quite frankly were flat on the same store customers down in July, which is unusual because that's one of the higher traffic months for us typically because of the 4th of July weekend. We did experience waggle calls and inclement weather throughout the majority of our marketing area, specifically over the 4th of July weekend. We had nearly record lows during that time with precipitation, so certainly we were impacted in that period of time. I think part of that traffic deceleration Chuck, has to do with our market area, we’re in the farm belt as you know, and right now we're seeing some challenges in corn, soybean prices, farm income down, and so that's affecting consumer spending right now.
Chuck Cerankosky: Okay. And looking at the prepared foods, excuse me, the grocery segment. You mentioned the cigarette volumes were off. Shouldn't that have helped the margin a little bit more because of the low margin on cigarettes?
Bill Walljasper: Well, yeah. What's happening in the cigarettes category Chuck, we have seen it, we kind of alluded to this in the last conference call. We are tracking in the high-single digits for cigarettes on a same-store basis, and that had to do with our conversion several years ago to the Marlboro leadership program at many of our stores. Now, we indicated in that call that we anticipated in fiscal 2017 that that would moderate back into the mid-single digits and that's kind of what's happening right now. We are seeing a moderation of cigarettes or deceleration I would say back into the mid-single digits. Also here what we have seen in this first quarter, we have seen a shift albeit our carton movement is still up relative to a year ago. We have seen a slowing down of the our carton movement, people are migrating back to the packs a little bit, also migrating a little bit away from our full value products to some more of the generic products, again affecting -- obviously those are lower rings with -- I mean with a little bit of higher margin. So that’s what’s going on in the cigarette category. The other thing I mentioned in the narrative was, we did make a shift through this first quarter away from bagging our own ice -- producing and bagging own ice to a direct store delivery program. You’re going from a margin of 80%-82% down to something in the 50s. Now in the long-term, we think that’s the way to go to free up our store employees to focus on other aspects of our business. Hopefully, that answered your question Chuck.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, just wanted to circle back on the consumer. I'm curious if you are continuing to see consumers uptrade, or has that trend peaked? And then I'd be curious to hear what your average basket ring was during the quarter, if that was up or down.
Bill Walljasper: Yes. The answer your question, the first part of that question is, we have seen in this past quarter a migration away from what I'll call a trade up to the premium brands, that we saw probably two, three quarters ago. Even though, we had lower retail fuel price from period over period, we have seen that shift, we’re also seeing shift, a little bit of a shift away from cartons back to packs, again a lower ring obviously which would affect your same-store sales. So we are seeing a movement in that direction of kind of back -- I’d say a little bit backwards or decelerating from what we had experienced in last few quarters. From a basket ring, our basket ring because of what I just mentioned there in part, the basket ring over the last few quarters has gone down sequentially, and so I think as a function of that movement as well.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, and then, Bill, you mentioned the really poor weather in July hurt your business. Are you feeling better about the Labor Day weekend? How was your business during that holiday?
Bill Walljasper: Well, I’m not sure we could have dialed up better weather in the Labor Day weekend, it was an absolute great weekend throughout our market area, and so we’re encouraged by that. And our three big holidays, Bonnie, as you probably know, , Fourth of July and Labor Day.
Bonnie Herzog: Yes. Okay, and then in terms of the grocery margins and you touched on certainly cigs, which you called out in the press release, and I think I understand what's going on there. But could you talk a little bit more about performance in some of your other high margin categories, maybe energy drinks? Are you possibly seeing a slowdown in energy, for instance, which is what we've been seeing in the recent Nielsen scanner data. Is there anything else going on there?
Bill Walljasper: Yes. Absolutely energy drinks are continuing to perform pretty well for us. That’s one of our bright spots. I would say sales, total sales are going to be somewhere in that, close to double-digit right now, high-single-digit, low-double-digit area. One thing I will mention too is our beer category, obviously weather will effect that particular category. But also we see a little bit of deflation going on in the beer category. We also see a little deflation in the milk category for us too. The beer category units were up nearly double-digits, but most of our items were retailing simply below where they were a year ago, so that’s the kind of the dynamic that we have seen here developed over the last three to four months.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, so just broadly speaking, when you think about the slowdown in grocery overall for you?
Bill Walljasper: I’m sorry. Can you repeat that question?
Bonnie Herzog: No I'm just thinking as you walk through some of your larger categories, such as cigs and beverages, it's really mostly a slowdown in cigs that's impacting your grocery business.
Bill Walljasper: Yeah, you’re right on point. Cigarettes are about roughly 40% of the overall contribution to the grocery in our merchandize category and so as though it starts to move direction to another, that’s really -- it can move the overall category. Now the other major areas of that category like the beer and beverage certainly can move it, but like you just asked, the new-age drinks, we're still in the high single-digit, low double-digit. Certainly, it's moderating, as I mentioned the narrative down at least this past quarter mid-single across-the-board for all those major areas.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, and then, Bill, my final question is just on your full-year guidance. Just trying to get a sense from you, given some of the softness in the quarter, how confident you are that you're going to be able to meet your FY17 goals. And I'm thinking about in the context, especially with the slowdown you're seeing in prepared food.
Bill Walljasper: I’ll answer that category by category, if you don’t mind. Firstly, obviously on the fuel category, it is performing very well and certainly we're performing both a margin perspective and same store gallon perspective ahead of goals. So we obviously feel very confident that we can continue that and hit that goal for the year. On the grocery and other merchandize category, I mean we’re only one quarter into that, we’re a little bit behind now, but I still think there is opportunity for us to hit that goal and so I think that’s still a solid goal for us. On the prepared food category, the margins certainly is a very achievable goal. I think it will be very challenging for us to hit that same store sales goal given the performance in the first quarter’s prepared food category.
Bonnie Herzog: That makes sense, and, certainly, you're lapping a very tough comp in prepared food. But you've seen a decent slowdown in your prepared food comps over the last few quarters. And I don't know if you want to touch on that, and if you have hopes or optimistic that you can reaccelerate growth in that area.
Bill Walljasper: Well, we’re certainly optimistic we can reaccelerate growth, but to reaccelerate, to get to that goal would be very challenging. With respect to the sequential movement down over the last three quarters, you want to look at that and look we’ve done quite a bit of work in looking at the food service casual dining quick serve restaurant industry and we noticed the same type of trend in those industries as well, and so I think that probably had to do with maybe timing of the consumer spending and maybe we didn’t really back in the last few quarters because we did have quite a bit of noise in the last several quarter with calendar shifts, weather comparisons. Also we had a delayed rollout of our major remodels and pizza delivery that we felt was impacting that as well. One of the things I do want to point out Bonnie is that the growth programs or initiatives that we have rolled out are still performing at the same type of sales that we have seen over the last probably two to three years, just that the unchanged store base is the one that is lagging a little bit right now. So I mentioned we have some promotional activity, I can’t tell you what that is for competitive reasons, but we plan on introducing some new promotional activity in the back half of the year. I mentioned the price increase that we’re looking at, we feel that we have opportunities there as we are starting to see some key item shift into our competitive pricing surveys.
Bonnie Herzog: Alright, thank you so much for all of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shane Hagan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Shane Hagan: Bill. I just wanted circle back on the May 1 price increases that you guys took in prepared foods, which I believe you guys said were concentrated in the pizza, pizza slices, and specialty sandwiches.
Bill Walljasper: Correct.
Shane Hagan: Did you really see any sales impact from that? I know, obviously, you mentioned the consumer may be slowing down a little bit, maybe not trading up, and you highlighted some of the industry trends. Do you guys see opportunities to take another price increase down the road maybe to offset some of the higher wages and salaries that you discussed earlier? Or do you think you're going to have to hold the line? Or is it a category-by-category issue?
Bill Walljasper: No, we believe that there are opportunities to take, some price increases, specifically in the prepared food category. We do monthly competitive pricing survey on key products and have a what we feel is a pretty good handle on the pricing environment within our 14 state market area. We have seen a shift here recently in some key products that some of our peers have made. And so we think we have an opportunity to take price increases and still stay within -- I should say not be out of the market and be competitive. So we're evaluating that and if it goes in that direction, it will happen in the next several months.
Shane Hagan: Okay, great. And then just wanted to get your thoughts on potential margin improvement maybe later this year that you guys could expect from the new DC, as that continues to ramp up. Any color on that or how we should think about that when we model out gross margins later in the year?
Bill Walljasper: Yeah, looking at the distribution center that is up and operates, been up and operational since February. We've been extremely pleased with the rollout of that distribution center and we anticipated actually over the course of the first year of its operation to roll into that DC of roughly about 600 stores. We did that actually in the first about six weeks after we opened that. The takeaway there is that because of that quick rollout and how efficient it's gone so far is, we plan on that being accretive this fiscal year. Whereas before coming into that rollout I think the guidance or commentary that we gave was that we would be neutral, neutralish. So, we are very pleased, don't having any metrics to share with you necessarily as far as how accretive that would be, but given the direction it’s going we do anticipate increases in Q1 -- the fiscal year.
Shane Hagan: Okay, great, and then just last one on the operating expenses. They came in a little better than I was modeling. How should we think about that -- modeling that out for the rest of this year? Should we still expect a low teens increase for the full year?
Bill Walljasper: Yeah I think for the full year I think that low double-digit number is still a good number to use. As I mentioned in the narrative of the call, we do anticipate and probably you can pick up on that by our press release accelerating units in the back half of the year. In Q2, Q3 and Q4 for that matter you will see a significant acceleration in unit growth as you can imagine with the number of stores we have under construction, replacement site we have under construction, major remodels we have under construction, as well as the sites we have under contract.
Operator: Our next question comes from Irene Nattel from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Irene Nattel: Just want to drill down a little bit more on -- so the disconnect between the pickup, if you will, in gas volumes, very strong gas volumes on a same-store basis against that inside store. So is it really just that people are coming more often, Fuel Saver is helping, but they're just being really cautious on what they are spending inside the store?
Bill Walljasper: Yeah, I think you are right on point. It was a disconnect for us when we finally rolled up all the result is, typically, when you see same-store gallon movement, like we are seeing, we can pull some of those people inside the store and just we believe that that’s what’s occurring right now. Miles driven by the DOT is up in that period of time, and so our fuel saver program continues to doing very well. And just for season have not been able to, the consumer is doesn’t feel like the need to come into the stores as often. So these are some of the things that we’ll be addressing and some of the promotional activity I’ve alluded to.
Irene Nattel: Okay, so that was my next question, Bill. Is there any way that you can tie in promotional active to the Fuel Saver program to help that conversion?
Bill Walljasper: Yes, that’s what we’re looking at currently, to try to drive some more additional traffic and convert those consumers inside the store. So we have some plans going forward. Just for -- obviously, as you can imagine, for competitive reasons, don't want to necessarily put those out at this point in time.
Irene Nattel: Absolutely, that makes a great deal of sense. Just coming back to the new DC, so how many routes have you now eliminated that -- or what proportion of routes have -- delivery route have you now eliminated that third day from?
Bill Walljasper: Yes. We have no three day truck routes currently. And a good share of our two day truck routes were eliminated as well in the conversion. So miles driven, nearly the take away when it comes to be in accretive. The two dynamics on a takeaway basis is miles driven is going down on a comparative basis, also the expenses related to having our drivers overnight at a hotels and meal expenses for those additional days are being mitigated. So that’s where we see those savings. We really are encouraged about that, we’re seen obviously, you kind of picked up on my narrative that we’re excited about the acquisition opportunities picking up, obviously more and more people knocking on our doors, people circling back to us and we have knocked on their doors in the past. And so hopefully, we can convert some of these opportunities into our company.
Irene Nattel: Yes, and that was going to be my next question, Bill. These acquisition opportunities, are they mostly singles or are you seeing some small chains in there as well?
Bill Walljasper: You see a number of small chains in there as well and these are new markets. It’s kind of one of designs of our second distribution center being placed in Terre Haute, Indiana. So it does afford us the opportunity to officially expand in new markets. As we mentioned in the press release, we’ll open our first store in Ohio here after the first of the calendar year. But many of these acquisitions are in these new markets, so we’re very excited about that.
Irene Nattel: And presumably, the stores in the new markets continue to perform well?
Bill Walljasper: Yes. Definitely as expected.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Kelly Bania: Just trying to make sense of some of the comments. So you're talking about still some opportunities for price increases, but also planning some new promotional activities. So I'm just trying to understand. Do you think net prices for in-store are coming up, or maybe one was in a different category? I was just trying to -- think you could parse that out a little bit?
Bill Walljasper: Yes. They’ll be in different categories. Most of the price increases will come through in the prepared food category. Those are the -- that’s a shift that we’re seeing in after market place that I referred to. Some of the promotional activities that we’re looking at will be [indiscernible] of the merchandize, but that’s not to say that we won’t run promotional activity in prepared food category as well. Really we just need to find what works the best to drive customer traffic inside the store.
Kelly Bania: Okay, and on the wages, you talked about the minimum salary impact about $10 million. We were thinking maybe it could be $20 million. So I'm guessing maybe you have some efforts in place to offset some of that. So can you just explain how you're doing that, what those are, how you expect that to play out over the next several months? And are you expecting or are you seeing or hearing that you think fuel margins could also be an offset to that? You mentioned you were seeing some price increases already coming through. Where are you starting to see that?
Bill Walljasper: Yes, the price increase piece that I mentioned, we are seeing most of that in the prepared food business in the convenient store area and not just the convenient store here, but also similar related industries in the QSR and casual dining side of it, that would overlap in our prepared food category. So with respect to the minimum salary requirements, there is several options that you can go with. We made a decision that we are going to keep our store managers on as salaried. We feel that, that is needed to be most efficient and to drive our business in the future. We also want to make sure that we’re really in for choice and we think continuing our store managers at salaried positioned I think sends a signal that we certainly want to be that particular employer of choice. Now going forward, you made an interesting comment there, Kelly, about the fuel margin. As you know you’ve been following us for a long time that when we see widespread pressure in our industry, at least over the last probably eight years, the typical offset we have seen in the fuel margin by our competitors. Now when this comes into fruition in December we’ll be monitoring that fuel environment very closely and there certainly could be an uptick in the fuel margin based on our offset of this particular new guidance. So right now that’s not in our plan yet, because you know we follow competition.
Kelly Bania: Okay, that's helpful, and going back to your goals, it sounds like you think the grocery category same-store sales goals are still maybe attainable apart from the new promotional activity. But I don't think there was a comment on the gross margin outlook there. You talked about the impacts of the ice, the adjustment from last year, but how do we think about that category in terms of gross margin over the next couple quarters?
Bill Walljasper: Well we certainly think that we have opportunities to still hit that goal at 32% and we introduced this new ice program to be more of a long-term play for us. We happen to introduce it in the first quarter and I’ll kind of come back to that Fourth of July weekend in the month of July, we introduced it at a time where we saw some inclement weather at probably a key area of our first quarter and so I am not sure we got the full benefit for that program. We saw significant gains in sales in ice, units were up tremendously. One of things that we experienced prior to going to the direct store delivery program is we had a difficult time keeping up at certain times of the year with ice production and in many case we were out of ice and if you’re coming to the convenient store to get ice, you are coming here to get ice and we don’t have it, you’re going to go somewhere else to get ice and you’ll probably buy your other products, whether its soda, beer or whatever. So we wanted to eliminate that, so we were running into that on a number of occasions in the past fiscal year, especially in the summer months. So I think that we have opportunities and that program is continuing to drive that, I just had a meeting this morning with the marketing department. They are optimistic that we can achieve that goal.
Kelly Bania: Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned the farm economies that you operate in, and potentially some of the impact on your core consumer. What are you expecting for the rest of the year in terms of that consumer and what the impact could have on that consumer? And if you look back on past commodity cycles when you have these depressed corn and wheat prices, what do you typically see from that consumer? Any color you have there.
Bill Walljasper: Yeah, it's a great question by the way Kelly, it’s a very good question. So when I look at the current environment that we are in and I am not an expert in this area, so I do a lot of reading obviously, but as far as the USDA, farm income is at the lowest level since 2009. They are expecting record corn and soybean crops this fall, but yet corn prices and soybeans are at seven year lows. When you look at food price and say you put a piece out on deflation earlier today and -- and so you are well aware of deflation. And so you are in a scenario, in the last nine months the falling food prices, we haven't seen that since probably 2009-2010. And so, I don't know how long that's going to last, but it appears it's going to last for another quarter or so, but again I don't have any insight on that, others on this call may. And so if you look back at 2000 or fiscal 2010 here you will see that we did had a mid single-digit comps back in fiscal 2010 at a similar time period that we're seeing right now or similar type of environment. But I don't think it's a very long term situation for us.
Kelly Bania: And when you look at some of the categories, you talked about the deflation in dairy -- milk, and beer, what are you seeing in volume trends there? And are you seeing promotional activity from your local supermarkets or local competitors there in trying to drive volume?
Bill Walljasper: I definitely see promotional activity from our local competitors and grocery store chains on a number of items, but the two you just mentioned there beer I mean, for us volume or unites in our beer category roughly almost double-digit, but yes the retail prices are off on our top 20 products. So, it's becoming much more promotional. Milk is kind of the similar situation, units are up but it is unfortunately the retail prices are now significantly and relationship to what your comment we just made. So, these are things that will work through, we've seen them in the past and so one of the thing I will point, I just want to reiterate is our core business is doing extremely well. The growth initiatives are performing as expected. We continue to roll those out. We're seeing quite a bit of activity in our new store construction as well as acquisitions. So I think we're positioned well for a longer term push.
Kelly Bania: Thanks and last one for me on the acquisitions, and it sounds like the mood is changing there from some of the potential companies you're looking to acquire. What do you think is driving that? Do you think it has anything to do with the wage pressures or the deflation or a combination of those factors? Or have you heard in any of your discussions why now a little bit more, maybe willingness to have those discussions?
Bill Walljasper: Yeah, that will vary obviously acquisition-to-acquisition. But I think the points you just made are very valid points. As the industry becomes more competitive for a number of reasons, whether that's from other peers or whether that's from just an economic perspective both will weigh in on people's decisions to when they sell their business. Also it can be just a situation where you a new -- maybe it's the second-generation or third-generation owner that doesn't quite have the same passion as the founder that particular chain and that’s looking to move on. So we are very pleased with what we have seen here in the last probably three to four months with people knocking back on our doors and people been receptive to our enquires as well. I don’t want to lose sight of our organic growth as well. I mean that is an area that were going to accelerate. I think, I mentioned this in the last call that, it's not -- it wasn't too far in the recent past we would build 80 to 90 sites and we’re moving that direction. So 80 to 90 sites or 4% unit growth just from organic and then on top of that with acquisition. So we’re in a good position right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
Daniel Imbro: This is Daniel Imbro on for Ben. My first question is on the prepared foods side. So we saw two-year stack decelerate about 600 basis points sequentially. Can you give some color on to what in that segment might be driving that slowdown? And then has that trend continued into the second quarter?
Bill Walljasper: Well to have that type of deceleration you’re going to probably see the majority of the major areas of that kind of step back. Now I would say bakery and our fountain category has comeback a little bit more or so and it really will depend on which quarter that you’re talking about and for instance when we experienced really hot weather, obviously the coffee side of that particular category will take a step back. Even to some degree when it’s very hot people we shift away from the soda and move into more of a bottled water type choice as well. So it does ebb and flow a little bit with the weather, but the bakery category certainly has been a little softer here recently and primarily in the cake and donuts. So when I talk about promotional activity, that’s some of those areas that we’re looking out essentially and trying to rejuvenate that area.
Daniel Imbro: That’s helpful, thanks. And then going forward, you mentioned that it will be challenging to me the same-store sales goal for the year for prepared food. Do you think, this two year stack or this kind of growth rate is more sustainable going forward?
Bill Walljasper: It’s a good question there. I mean, when I look at the prepared food categories and as I look at tit last 10 years, 3 years, 5 years whatever period you look at, we’re averaging in the last 10 years, just shy of 10% comp growth, a little bit over that in the last three to five years. So I think definitely high single-digits on a sustained basis is achievable.
Daniel Imbro: Okay. Thank you. And then one last one, changing gears here. On a rollout of EMV, do you have a sense the remaining CapEx requirement to implement that across the store base?
Bill Walljasper: Yes. Good question Dan. The EMV just to make sure everybody, that goes into effect October of next year. It’s not a mandates as we all know, it’s just, that’s the liability shift comes into play. So right now, we’re evaluating the best rollout of EMV, and it really will come down to the competitive landscape of our marketplace. So what I mean by that is, how will our competitor response to that, will they implement EMV technology at the pump or will they just assume the liability of credit card fraud, and so we’re kind of on a wait-and-see right there. When we look at that, I can tell you that we do not plan to rollout EMV to all of our stores, it just necessarily doesn’t make a lot of sense in the small communities where we don’t have a lot of potential credit card fraud, or historically haven’t had that type of activity. And but it is an expensive endeavor, I mean there is roughly $30,000 to $40,000 per store dependent on a number of pumps. So we’ll be very calculative in how we roll that out. More than likely if we do roll it out to a large degree it will be more on stores that are in state located, larger metropolitan areas that we might be more susceptible to that type of activity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: So I just wanted to circle back to the earlier commentary about the weather. Bill, would it be possible any way for you to quantify what you think was the impact on your same-store sales because of the unfavorable weather?
Bill Walljasper: We actually haven’t quantified that, but certainly in July it was very evident for us and we saw average temperature significantly below what they were a year ago. But definitely an impact for us if you look at our sales activity, but overall in the comp base, we don’t have a number to give you at this point.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Got it, and just wanted to get a better sense of the timing of store remodels. So it looks like you did 6 in the first quarter; you plan to do 100. So are the rest going to be more evenly spread out or is it more back half loaded? What do you think?
Bill Walljasper: The remainder of those should be evenly spread out over the last three quarters.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Got it, okay. So I think you said earlier that you've completed 364 store remodels, but you've also opened some new stores. So just wondering when you look at your store base in total, what percentage of your stores are in the format that you like -- that you would say is the ideal format?
Bill Walljasper: Yeah, so I think what you’re asking is, I’m going to rephrase your question a little bit here. The new format would have the sub sandwiches included, maybe an expanded coffee bar. Some would have a sit down area, some wouldn't. Some would also had have a beer cave. Those are the amenities that we’re really focused on here over prior to last seven years or so with earnings store construction, replacements and the remodel programs, so I’ll give you a few numbers there. So everything is built in 2008 and anything we replace in 2008 have that new format. And so you’re looking roughly about, I mean the 300 and we’ve mentioned the 364 major remodels, those have those. We have an approximately another 300 roughly, 350 on top of that. So roughly about 600 to 700 would have that type of format to some degree or another.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Okay, that sounds good. So and over time, do you think, obviously not all stores will be in this format, because I imagine the smaller communities don't require this. But how do you see that in the next few years as far as the store format having the updated features that you just described?
Bill Walljasper: We continue to see, everything we touch now Anthony, including the acquisition, we try to incorporate that and all those amenities into it. So all the new store constructions that we talked about here in the press release as well as today in the call are going to have those amenities the major remodels obviously would, we have a longer runway on the major remodels than any other initiative we have. And I think there is a tremendous amount of opportunity to continue to convert our stores and add that type of dynamic. It will be interesting as we also go in to some new markets, introduce those types of products as well. So we think we have opportunity there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Bookbinder from Coker & Palmer. Your line is now open.
Ronald Bookbinder: You were just talking about the -- what you're going to offer in the new stores, new market. Are you limited when looking at new markets as to having the square footage for food, when looking at acquisitions or are you looking more at building your own as you expand east and south?
Bill Walljasper: Well, right now our focus is weighted towards organic growth as we move into new markets. However, we are not opposed to looking at acquisitions which we alluded to already on the call. You made a good point there Ron, one of the things that we bring to an acquisition one of the synergy is our ability to bring our prepared food operation into that. And so to the extent that you come across acquisitions that are smaller boxes and don't have the land availability to grow that. More likely than not we will probably shy away from those, and so to that degree I guess yes it would limit us, but we certainly would not want to take on acquisition, especially in the new market and not have the ability to put our best foot forward and we think our best foot forward -- at least part of our best foot forward be our prepared food offerings. And so we want to make sure we have that opportunity there because we want to make sure we get off on the right foot in those new communities.
Ronald Bookbinder: And so as you enter these new communities, putting your best foot forward, what percent of revenue does a new market store typically do compared to a legacy store?
Bill Walljasper: Yeah, good question. What we found at least in the markets that we've penetrated here recently and that's in last three to four years is about pulling our Arkansas, Tenancy, Kentucky and to another degree North Dakota. What we generally see is that fuel gallons and grocery and other merchandise ramps up similar to stores that we open in some of our core markets. The area that tends to lag a little bit is prepared food because we're not quite as well known. And so we do a little bit different promotional activity on prepared foods in those markets to get our brand recognition out there.
Ronald Bookbinder: Okay, and you've talked a fair amount about acquisitions, but are you seeing multiples on acquisitions moving either up or down?
Bill Walljasper: Multiples are a little bit over the board. We have seen some double-digit multiples in our market area. We've also seen some single-digit which would be kind of a high single-digit. And so we're not going to grow just for growth's sake. We are going to make very calculated good decisions with respect to acquisitions and so we will be disciplined in that. But it seems like multiples are starting to ease a little bit relative to roughly about nine months to 12 months ago.
Ronald Bookbinder: And looking at the income statement, it just looked a little odd to me that D&A decreased sequentially from Q4, despite the CapEx in the quarter. What was driving that?
Bill Walljasper: Really got to look back into prior to that quarter, the number of roll offs that we have for major remodels, the number of store operating that we’re operating relative to period over period. We also probably had -- on the replacement side, we had a lot of replacements and accelerated depreciation advantage in that particular quarter, whereas perhaps this quarter we didn't. The depreciation just as a reiteration, depreciation we think will grow in a fiscal year somewhere in that mid teen range, especially as we accelerate some of those activities on the later part of the fiscal year.
Ronald Bookbinder: And lastly, you had the out-of-period adjustment that affected the gross margin. Does that affect margins going forward?
Bill Walljasper: No, that was just more of a comparative issue. We discovered that in Q2 of last year and corrected it into the second quarter of last year. So really what that particular out-of-period adjustment was about $2.6 million of expense that should have been in the first quarter last year. So it benefited last year’s margin and gross another merchandise, so that’s why I pointed out on comparative basis if you look at the grocery and another merchandise margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel O’Hare with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Daniel O’Hare: Was there any uptick in the competitive environment in the quarter from a pricing perspective? And do you think that the deflation going on in grocery stores has lowered prices enough to maybe take some share away from you? Like people will come to the gas station, not go inside, but their trunk will be filled with groceries. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that, thanks.
Bill Walljasper: On the later question, definitely we are seen pricing in the grocery stores in our market area and probably this is true around our mid-Western area, come down in some very key areas, meat obviously is one of them, milk is one of them, there is a number of products that are obviously experiencing deflation. And so possibly, I don’t have data point that I can point to, with respect to -- I think your first part of your question was related to price uptick, I think that was the question. The only price uptick that I could really point two is really in the fuel side of business, we saw a rational, I’ll call it rational fuel pricing environment in Q1. Time were wholesales were moving down. So I think that was part of the reasons we saw an expanded fuel margin. Outside of that, we haven’t seen a price uptake in any key items that we talked about.
Daniel O’Hare: Got it. And then how many stores, when you acquire a small chain, how many stores does that typically involve? And is there a similar opportunity to improve the EBIT margins in those stores as compared to like acquiring just a single store? Thanks.
Bill Walljasper: Yes. As far as the average number of the stores, it’s really all over the Board. I mean traditionally, we’ve done a lot of one-offs, onesie-twosies, small chains, and that will continue probably it would be the way we’re going forward. Now we are as I mentioned, we are seeing some of the larger chains that have not come knocking on our goal that we’re evaluating. Answer to your other part of that question maybe help to talk about the synergies we bring to an acquisition. This would be true one store or whether it’s 100 stores. And so the first synergy that we bring is due to our sales distribution model. We will buy better inventory at their costs, once we cycle out of their inventory we bring in our inventory. Generally speaking, we see a margin uplift in the inside of the store, anywhere from 200 to 900 basis points depending on the operator. The second synergy I think Ron asked a question earlier about this, is our ability to add our prepared food operations and integrate that into the acquisition. That’s why were a little particular on size for box, or the land that it sits on. So we have the opportunity to add a kitchen. And again, it's either an addition outside the store or inside the box. So we have to keep it roughly 9 to10 months after we close on that site and then certainly we ramp up the prepared food program from that point forward. Hope that answered your question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Summers with Mcquarie. Your line is now open.
Bob Summers: So you talked about the store initiatives delivering what you expected. And I think within that, you said some of the challenges were in the unchanged store base. Is there a way you can quantify the comp differential between those two buckets of stores?
Bill Walljasper: Yes, I can actually. I would say the unchanged store base and you have our overall comp that we put out there. The unchanged store base that we have right now is probably in the mid to low single digit processing categories.
Bob Summers: Okay.
Bill Walljasper: And just a follow up on that comment there and so we’re talking about store base to roughly 1,300 stores on an unchained base. So this isn't one pocket; this is across the entire market area, which leads me back to the whole macro environment that kind of pulling that down a little bit.
Bob Summers: Okay, and two related questions to that. It sounds like on prepared food with the comp expectation, it's now a stretch goal. So with that in mind, why not take the opportunity to take it down a little bit and take the pressure off yourself?
Bill Walljasper: Well I mean we could do that Bob, I am not sure that takes any pressure off, you’re just lowering the bar basically is what you’re doing So traditionally even when we were in exact opposite environment, we don’t raise our goal from where we put out there. So we think it’s better for us to say here we put these goals out at the end of the fiscal year and we’re going to report on our goals as we go forward throughout the year and tell you how we’re performing. I mean we could pull that down, I’m not sure if that serves, think from our perspective, not sure it serves a lot of purpose from our side.
Bob Summers: Okay, and then just digging a little into the cautious in-store spending and you're talking about farm income being lowest since 2008, 2009. When I look at your store base, it would seem to be that there's probably a four or five state cluster where this is hugely impactful. And I'd be curious if that's what you're seeing in the numbers in terms of how different regions are performing. And then maybe within that, rural versus less rural stores. And what I'm getting at is in addition to farm income being challenging, is there potentially something else going on highlighting the fact that a week and a half ago, one of the dollar stores talked about how their lower-end consumer base is actually saying they're worse off?
Bill Walljasper: Yeah, I read that by the way, I saw that. And you had a lot of questions and hopefully I’ll get them all answered, If I don’t please circle back with me, if you don’t mind. But from a main state that you refer to like of Iowa, Missouri, that are in that farm belt, and as I look at by state and I kind of alluded to this a little bit ago, that as I look at it there is not a significant differential in cost on a state-by-state basis and when we look at those avenue. Now if you look at on a population basis, keep in mind that we run in the major metropolitan area where most of our stores are in 20,000 population or less and even those stores I think will be impacted for this that we’re talking about and as I look at the population disparity, I don’t see a tremendous difference in the growing of the merchandize category and really even the prepared food category albeit I will say the stores that we have in the prepared category 20,000 population or more have loaded by our camp and I am not sure it's material. Also keep in mind that delivery is a pizza is majority in our metropolitan areas, so that’s probably affecting the prepared food category.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is a follow up question from Irene Nattel with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Irene Nattel: Just a point of clarification, please. When you say, for example, in the grocery category you think you can still get to the goal, do you mean that in subsequent quarters, you think you can generate numbers in line with the goal? Or do you mean that in subsequent quarters, you think you can come in above the goal, so that for the full-year basis you come out in line?
Bill Walljasper: We see, we still think we have an opportunity to drive same store sales to get to our annual goal by the end of the year.
Irene Nattel: That is very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I will now like to turn the call back over to Bill Walljasper for any further remarks.
Bill Walljasper: I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And hope everybody has a nice week. Take care.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."
