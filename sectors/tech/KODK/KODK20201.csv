"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Eastman Kodak Q1, 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Paul Dils. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Paul Dils: Thank you, Jimmy, and good afternoon everyone. I am Paul Dils, Eastman Kodak Company's Chief Tax Officer and Director of Investor Relations. Welcome to Kodak's first quarter 2020 earnings call. At 4:15 P.M. this afternoon Kodak filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and issued its release on financial results. You may access the presentation and webcast for today's call on our Investor Center at investor.kodak.com.
Jim Continenza: Thanks Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. First off, I hope everyone is healthy and safe through the COVID-19 pandemic that we've been going through, and no tragedy has come upon you and your friends or family or loved ones. We'd like to take the time to -- currently we're sitting on 2020. And 2019, just remember Kodak took drastic members, drastic measures in cleaning up its balance sheet. We also took great measures and focusing the business in three primary areas, print, advanced materials and chemistry and chemicals. In doing such, and making those moves, we're able to end 2020 with a strong balance sheet of $233 million in cash and cash equivalents. For the first time in many years not losing $100 million plus. In 2020, we're off to a great trajectory, building off with the 2019 accomplishments.
David Bullwinkle: Thanks Jim, and good afternoon. Today the company filed its form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 with the securities and exchange commission. As always, I recommend you read this filing in its entirety.
Operator:
Jim Continenza: Great. Well, thank you. First off again, I want to thank everyone for joining. And I want to thank the entire Kodak team, the amount of effort that they've put into this quarter. It has been unbelievable, the amount of work this pandemic has caused. In the late nights and everyone working from home, we are able to mobilize within a week, everyone's working from home using Microsoft teams, using WiFi cloud, doing virtual and still making the company run. And more importantly, I really want to thank our employees who show up every day, and keep the factories that keep the supply chain working. The courage it takes for them to do that and continue to help this company grow is just getting -- we can't say enough. Again and I want everyone to stay safe. But more importantly, I just want to make sure that we recognize those that have to go to work every day in this environment, and go home to their families. And we're doing everything we can to keep them safe. So, with that, thanks for joining the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude your program. You may now disconnect."
