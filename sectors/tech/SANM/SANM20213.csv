Jure Sola: Thanks Paige. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome. Thank you for being here with us today. I would like to make a few comments before I turn it over to our CFO.
Kurt Adzema: Thanks Jure. Please turn to slide five. In the third quarter, our team did an excellent job of managing through the increasing prevalence of supply chain constraints leading to strong margins and profitability as well as cash generation. Q3 revenue of $1.66 billion was slightly below our outlook of $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion. Demand was strong. However, we believe revenue was impacted by more than $150 million due to supply chain constraints. Non-GAAP gross margin was 8.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 5%, consistent with prior quarter. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share of $0.99 exceeded our outlook of $0.84 to $0.94, primarily as a result of better than expected gross margin. Finally, GAAP EPS was $1.74. During the quarter, we had a gain of $43.4 million related to the release of certain foreign tax reserves, a gain of 8.4 million related to the liquidation of one of our foreign subsidiaries and other income of $15 million related to the sale of IP. Each of these items has been excluded from our non-GAAP results. Please turn to slide six. This slide shows the quarterly trend of our financial results. You can see, our team did an excellent job of managing the business during this dynamic period. Non-GAAP gross margins have exceeded 8% for the last five consecutive quarters. Non-GAAP operating margins have been 5% or greater for the last four consecutive quarters. If we compare our Q3 FY 2021 results to Q3 FY 2020, you can see on approximately the same level of revenue, gross margin has improved from 8.1% to 8.5%, operating margin has improved from 4.6% to 5% and non-GAAP EPS has improved from $0.86 to $0.99. We have learned a lot over the last 12 months and the hard work and focus of our team is demonstrated by this year-over-year improvement. Furthermore, we believe our revenue will increase and our margins will continue to improve as material supply chain constraints resolve.
Jure Sola: Thanks Kurt. Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you more about the business environment for the third quarter and I will talk about outlook for the fourth quarter and outlook for fiscal year 2022. Again, as you heard from Kurt, Sanmina delivered respectable results for the third quarter with strong margins and strong free cash flow. Material shortages continue to impact revenue growth, both for IMS and CPS businesses. Let we talk to you about some key drivers in the third quarter. We had a strong demand. This was broad-based and market demand. Our supply chain team did an excellent job in this environment and we had a great operational execution. Through our operational flexibility, we delivered critical requirements for our customers. And the business mix was good, driven mainly by new projects. Now let me tell about the new facility that we added in Eastern Europe. During the third quarter, Sanmina expanded Eastern European operations by acquiring a state-of-art manufacturing operations in Bulgaria. It's going to be extension of our Hungarian operations. It is fully operational IMS facility with highly skilled staff and strategically located to serve European customers. This factory was formally owned by a large European technology company. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Bulgarian team to Sanmina family. So in summary, Sanmina is executing well in this dynamic environment as we continue to work very closely with our customers and our suppliers. Please turn to slide 12. Let me tell you more about the third quarter revenue by end markets. Demand for our product and services continues to grow. Top 10 customers were 50.9% of our third quarter revenue. Communication networks and cloud infrastructure was 42% and industrial, medical, defense and automotive were 58% of our revenue. Material shortages did impact third quarter revenue by approximately $150-plus million. Now let me tell you about the bookings. Bookings continue to be strong, both from existing and new projects. Book-to-bill for the quarter was over 1.1.
Operator: . Your first question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.
Ruplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Jure, most of the companies that we have heard from, they are talking about component shortages lasting well into next year. So can you give us an idea for fiscal 4Q, how much of an impact on revenues have you baked into the guidance? And what is giving the confidence in CPS margin improvement? If revenue constraints are still there, then what is giving the confidence that next quarter the CPS margins can be better?
Jure Sola: Okay. Well, first of all, when it comes to knowing what's going to happen with material supply at this time is very hard to forecast. We think definitely it's going to continue to be challenging through the rest of this calendar year. We hope to see some improvements after that. So if you look at the fourth quarter, we can definitely ship more than what we are guiding if we can get material. So our forecast includes all the potential shortages that we have. We talked to our customers, suppliers. So we feel very confident about our guidance. But we definitely could ship lot more. When comes to the margin on CPS is that definitely if you look, let's look at the product services. Those margins run around 20%-plus potentially. I think in the short term, we see nice improvements in our component businesses on our high technology circuit boards. We see in our optical components improvements. We expect to see nice improvements in our defense group. And as you put those together, I believe you are going to see nice improvements in the fourth quarter. And longer term, we expect those to continue to move in the right direction and our internal goal on that is to be over 15%.
Ruplu Bhattacharya: Got it. Thanks for the details on that, Jure. In terms of just building on the component shortages, can you talk about which components you are seeing shortages in? And is it impacting any one end-market more than the other?
Jure Sola: Well, most of the products that we are doing is, we do a lot with a lot of custom products and a lot of them are single sourced. So the biggest issue is a custom around semi. And that's what has been a challenge for us and it's been a major impact in some of the high end companies in the military side of our business, in security and networking and optical side of the business. So that's been the biggest impact for us.
Ruplu Bhattacharya: Got it. And just talking on optical, Jure, can you give us some details on the communications end-market? Last quarter you had expected that that market would have strong demand and would be up sequentially. Can you just to tell us what you saw in networking, optical, IP routing, all of the different components within that? Was there any strength or weakness in any of these segments?
Jure Sola: Actually, for us, it was really strong demand across all those segments. As we said earlier, we missed approximately $150 million in revenue because of material. So that was across all our markets. But a fair amount was around that segment in our communication networks.
Ruplu Bhattacharya: Got it. And maybe the last one, if I can ask. Kurt, can you give us your thoughts on working capital management? You talked about inventory being sequentially up. But then as we look forward, any guidance you have? What is your target on in terms of cash conversion cycle for this year? Should we think about free cash flow for this year? Thank you.
Kurt Adzema: Sure. Let's focus on inventory first. I think the key to when, we said we would return to more normalized levels of inventory when the supply chain constraints are resolved. So if you look at what Jure talked about, we expect that to go into early part of next year. So it's going to take multiple quarters. That being said, we are running inventory turns in the high sevens. And so I would expect to get back in that range as supply chain constraints resolve. That being said, I think you asked a question about cash flow and cash cycle days. Our cash flow remains incredibly strong. And I expect that to continue. We talked about the CapEx being a little bit higher this quarter just because we are ramping some new programs but still less than depreciation. So I expect cash flow generation to continue to be really strong even with the challenges that we are seeing. And then obviously, as the supply chain constraints get resolved and therefore we have higher revenue and hopefully better margins, then it will get even better. But I think we can continue to generate strong cash flow even at that these levels.
Ruplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details. I appreciate it.
Jure Sola: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment.
Jure Sola: Hello Jim.
Jim Suva: And congratulations to your team in such a challenging environment.
Jure Sola: Thanks Jim.
Jim Suva: Given that environment is quite challenging, are you having to like renegotiate price or put in cost-adders. I know you do also metal products and a lot of components, whether it's copper, aluminum, steel, plastic, resins, have going up. Can you talk a little bit about your contracts with customers? Or do they have like cost-plus for the most part? Just trying to see how protected you are in a component rising cost environment?
Jure Sola: Yes. Jim, it's an excellent question. First of all, let me kind of give you a summary answer. On most of those, the answer is yes, that we get covered when materials go up, we are covered in most of our contracts. We have few contracts that is our responsibility, especially on the products that we design and build that comes to Sanmina. On our government contracts, it's cost-plus. So overall we are well covered on that stuff. But unfortunately, it takes time to increase those adders, as you mentioned. Everything then comes to raw material to chemicals to semiconductors, prices are up. But our customers are being fully flexible. They understand what's going on. And I think our competitors are doing the same thing.
Jim Suva: And then my follow-up question is on your new facility. I believe you said it was Bulgaria. I may have had that wrong.
Jure Sola: That's correct.
Jim Suva: Does it also come with production agreements or equipment? Or what's it kind of set up for? And again any revenue run rate that came with it? Are is it kind of starting from scratch?
Jure Sola: Definitely, let me just tell you a little overview. This factory was built about three years ago. It's a state-of-art factory. It's designed for high technology IMS manufacturing, end-to-end. It does come with some business. It's not material, but it really helps us because you know, we have approximately 700 people in the plant that are well-trained. So overall, we like this project. We needed expansion in Eastern Europe. So it's a perfect fit.
Jim Suva: Okay. My last question. Can you talk a little about what type of end-markets it serves so we can just kind of be aware about that.
Jure Sola: Right now, a fair amount is a automotive part of the business. But we are adding other parts to it. As I said earlier, this will be extension of our Hungarian operation. So we have a fair amount of business that we can be overflowing to this factory in the near future.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much for additional clarification and details. It's appreciated.
Jure Sola: Thanks Jim.
Operator: . Your next question is from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.
Christian Schwab: Hi. Congrats guys on another good quarter on gross margins.
Jure Sola: Thanks Christian.
Christian Schwab: I just have one quick question regarding the custom semiconductor use in a lot of your different products that you are making for people. Is there any one area that you guys are sitting here and thinking it might open up for you specifically faster? I know some of your leading communication customers have multiple vendors for their chipset now. But I also know there is a lot of scrambling going on in every area. Is there one area or another that you think opens up first? Or do you think it all gradually improves at the same pace?
Jure Sola: First of all, I like your words, there is a lot of scrambling going on around, Christian, right now. It depends on our customers. Some customers have a lot stronger relationship with some certain semiconductor companies. Some customers ordered some of these things long time ago. So we are getting better flexibility. And some of these, we just have to chase everyday. But overall, I just don't see major improvements in the short term. We are hoping that we are going to see some in the fourth quarter. But we will see how things shake out. I think overall we are getting a little bit better because we have been chasing some of these parts for the last six-plus months. So in some cases, we can see visibility is a little bit better. At the same time, our customers are working with us and they have given us a longer forecast and longer commitments where there are some guaranteed contracts going on. So we can go an make a commitment on these component. So hoping, combining all of this through better planning, better commitments that material overall will improve. But as I said earlier, a lot of the stuff that we buy is custom and single source. So that becomes a bigger impact.
Christian Schwab: Right. And then I just wanted to clarify, the $150 million that you kind of lost in potential revenue this quarter due to material shortages, we shouldn't assume any of those as lost demand, right? That's, we are just waiting on components, given the fact that a lot of stuff you doing this is sole-source work? Is that fair?
Jure Sola: Yes. That's a fair statement. We don't expect that as lost. They have just been pushed out from last quarter to this quarter. And hopefully, I know there will be some push-out in quarter because of not getting enough material. But overall, it will just kind of move to the next quarter at this time.
Christian Schwab: Great. No other questions. Thank you.
Jure Sola: Well, thanks. Well, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for your time and I appreciated all your comments. If you have any more questions, please let us know. In the meantime, we will be talking to you 90 days from now. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
Kurt Adzema: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
