Backlog was $1.36 million as of December 31, 2018, driven by contracts for Micronet's new Mobile Resource Management or MRM products including the TREQ-317 and TREQr5. We expect demand will continue to grow as the year demanded requirement deadline of December 2019 new in addition new MRM product are used by Micronet.
