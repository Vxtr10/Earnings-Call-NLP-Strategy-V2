David Lucatz: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter of 2019, we continue to advance towards completion of an acquisition agreement that MICT entered into in December of 2018 with BNN, ParagonEx, and a group of founders. Just after the end of the second quarter in July 2019, we announced signing of certain definitive agreements relating to the offering by MICT, a separate investor of convertible notes and preferred stock, collectively totaling of $9 million, with $7.25 million of this amount already have been received by MICT and the remaining $1.75 million expected in the next six weeks.The completion of the $7.25 million to date has served a significant milestone for the company. Based on the convertible note opening, BNN invested $2 million in MICT, which instrument is contemplated to replace certain existing clinical instruments on more favorable terms. Micronet Ltd, in which MICT holds 39.63% both in stake continues to receive sales contracts with current customers, which we believe is a clear sign of confidence and satisfaction from its customer base.Micronet orders during the second quarter totaled $3.6 million for its 4th generation SmartHub hardware and its TREQ VMX platforms to existing customers, with $90,000 of the orders being recurring revenue. In addition, Micronet believes that the development of its next generation advanced technologies the top 8 and the SmartCAM is currently proceeding as planned.On Slide 6, we will review the second quarters 2019 financial results. We would like to remind our investors that MICT currently holds a 39.53% voting stake in Micronet. And therefore, based on U.S. GAAP rules, MICT no longer reports consolidated results due to its reduced ownership of Micronet effective March 1, 2019. While Micronet had a $3.6 million in sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019, revenue for MICT was $0 for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.Gross loss was $0 for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to gross profit of $1.53 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.

Net loss attributed to MICT was $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to a net profit of $3.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.I will now turn the call Moran for a more detailed financial review.
