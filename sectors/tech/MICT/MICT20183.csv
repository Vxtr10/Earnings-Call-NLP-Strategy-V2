I will now turn the call over to David, who will begin the presentation on Slide 3. Please go ahead, David.
David Lucatz: Thank you. Good morning everyone. We believe that with an increasing number of companies have met the year demand requirement. We are now seeing a drop in demand and change in customers NIM. As a result, MICT experienced a decrease in revenue and gross margin in Q3, 2018 as compared to Q3, 2017. Q3, 2018, revenue decreased by 60% to $2.2 million over Q3, 2017 revenue of $5.5 million. Gross profit decreased by 96% to $0.05 million in Q3, 2018, as compared to $1.5 million in Q3, 2017. Gross margin decreased to 2% in Q3, 2018 from 27% in Q3, 2017. Our backlog was $0.6 million as of September 30, 2018. We believe we will be able to deliver on this backlog in Q4, 2018. Our results for the first nine months of 2018 were more provable revenue increased by 8% to $12.9 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared to $12 million in the first nine months of 2017.

Gross profit margin was 26% in the first nine months of 2018 as compared to 22% in the first nine months of 2017. Now moving to Slide number 5. On Slide 4, we present our market status and business development. New orders were stronger than expected during the third quarter and we believe this will be the result of most MRM companies having spread the magic experience AMD mandate requirement. We are gaining traction with the new market base initiative that includes co-marketing sub-constructing and distribution agreement. We are also working our long-term customer acquisition projects with larger fleet in the U.S. and Europe. We are also seeing strong interest for the market for our Smart Connected Camera, that is due to be sold commercially during 2019 and we will enable service such as ADAS, Driver Awareness and other application as part of this management. Our next-generation LTE certification is now in the process to be completed. Strategic partnership agreement with establish ASP in the space to launch Android-based Smart dual camera for ADAS and real-time vision analytics. Additionally, while we are focusing our efforts in improving our business performance, we are also continuing to negotiate a definitive agreement for the transaction contemplated by the letter of intent entered into with BNN Technology PLC announced on July 2, 2018. I am moving to Slide 6. On the Slide 6, we have outlined our research and development and new product and service development initiatives and potentially drive future revenues. We are building the back-end system for commercial website that will serve MRM markets. It will launch with 5 to 6 applications that we intend to sell to the MRM market. Our TAB8 is under development and we expect the prototype to be ready to Q3, 2019, and production by the end of -- by the second half of 2019. The Micronet Smart Camera that we are developing is expected to be in production during the second half of 2019. We expect another bulk of $1 million to 1 million to 2 million trucks to be required to meet the ELD mandate by the December 2019. The second phase expects to include bigger fleet than in phase one which are more suitable for Micronet's product. I will now turn the call to Tali for financial review. Tali?

I will now turn the call back over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. At this time, we’ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Joe Tracy of Lakeview Capital Partners. Please go ahead.
Joe Tracy: I know you’re not allowed to discuss a whole lot on this as far as the BNN tender offer, but can you tell me whether or not management or insiders will be allow to participate if and when the tender offer happens?
David Lucatz: Well, I cannot of course disclose any information as you mentioned and part of the non-disclosure is also mentioned in management or officer, but I suggest that you go back to the filing what you did a couple of months ago and I believe all information is there.
Joe Tracy: And then one other question, in your proxy statement that came out a couple of weeks ago, you’re asking shareholders to vote to increase the number of shares in the Company in order to pay incentive fees to management when the stock price is decreased 65% from where you sold your big chunk of shares and I’m sure all the shareholder would love to participate it in that sale. I mean why would you expect any shareholder to vote on that proxy?
David Lucatz: Well, you have a couple of questions in one question, but let me just answer exactly the decision is the decision of the board, and the board decided that this is the right thing to do for the Company. Mentioning by the way the third, you also mentioned a couple of minutes ago, the tender offers. So tender offer is also open for the public, so I don’t see any reason why you cannot participate in tender offers as well.
Joe Tracy: Given the stock price right now down in the $0.40 range and the tender was mentioned at $1.65 minimum. I mean it certainly didn't look like to anybody out here that the $1.65 minimum would be the tender price is that -- can that be negotiated down?
David Lucatz: Well again, you ask me to disclose information about negotiations, so I cannot disclose any information, and I can also not in charge of whoever looked at it the way look at it. I just simply can direct you back to the finding which we did. And as we mentioned in this call, we are still negotiating with BNN transaction. Other than that I cannot add anything else.
Joe Tracy: Okay. Well, then from the MICT side business, I mean surely you can disclose this because in your press release on July 2nd, you said that you hope to close the seal within three months. Is there a cut off time where MICT says, we’re tire to negotiating we’re out here. I mean can this go on for another six months or a year? Or do you all have a set timeframe of saying we either going to get it done by now or we’re out of here?
David Lucatz: Well, I can just tell you that we are negotiating right now, if there would have been a deadline I would told you, okay. But right now, we’re in middle of negotiation. Just it remind me a similar question which you had a year ago about the Enertec transaction, and we simply final the transaction, five times later despite this question. So, I strongly suggest that you take information and think for it so.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Joe Tracy. Please go ahead.
Joe Tracy: Okay. So, we don't know whether or not management can participate in the tender, but right now as management restricted from buying share from the open market of MICT?
David Lucatz: Well, the management is going according to the -- actually what the name into trade policy, we are working according to that so I cannot be stored if you can sell, buy or anything else. We just grew what level we have to do and we work according to -- you can find everything in the public disclosure. Yes, we're working according to the policy of the Company.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Before I ask David to make his concluding statement, I would like to remind participants that a replay of this call will be available within two hours. In the U.S., please dial 1-866-276-1485, in Israel please dial 03-925-5936, internationally please dial 972-3-925-5936. David, would you like to make your concluding remarks?
David Lucatz: Yes, thank you. Thanks to all of our shareholder and our dedicated employees and management while our third quarter results were less than we expected. We are working hard to improve our results. Thank you and I'm looking forward to speaking to you early next year with our 2018 year-end results.
Operator: This concludes Micronet Enertech Technologies third quarter 2018 results conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may go ahead and disconnect."
