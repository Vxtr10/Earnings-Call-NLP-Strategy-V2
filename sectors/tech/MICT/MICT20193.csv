Then we will move to review the numbers with Moran.I will now turn the call over to David, who will begin the presentation on slide 5. Please go ahead, David.
David Lucatz: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into a review with the first quarter number for MICT, I would like to review the major funding and acquisition agreement we recently announced.We believe our strategic decision to enter into the fintech space through this acquisition agreement and $25 million in funding for a convertible note will potentially increases shareholder value for MICT today and into the future.On November 7, 2019, MICT, Inc. signed an agreement for a $25 million private placement of convertible notes, converting automatically subject to certain closing conditions at $ 1.41 per share at the closing of an acquisition by the Company of Global Fintech Holdings, GFH, which acquired the ParagonEX Limited group of companies and the trading companies of BNN Technology PLC.Through its newly acquired subsidiaries, GFH provide its platforms within the financial trading and Contracts for Difference, CFD sectors in Europe, Middle East, and Asia. Upon closing of the merger, the combined MICT Group is expected to have a strong balance sheet with over $25 million of cash, enabling the company to pursue a revenue acquisition program and to materialize significant Fintech opportunities in China. The acquisition agreement amongst the companies is subject to certain closing conditions.Now we move to Slide number 6 to review the third quarter numbers. During the third quarter, we successfully closed on a series of strategic transactions, resulting in the receipt by the company of a total of $7.25 million, consisting of Series A convertible preferred stock and convertible notesThis $7.25 million include, before expenses, $5.25 million in Series A convertible preferred stock, and a $2 million convertible note purchased by BNN Technology to replace MICT's existing creditor instruments on more favorable terms, plus applicable warrant coverage.BNN and MICT have the option to increase the amount of the note financing to $3 million in the future. An additional $1.75 million is expected through a Series A convertible preferred in the near future, resulting in an aggregate of potentially $9 million in the proceeds to the company.On Slide 7, we will review the third quarter 2019 financial results. As a reminder, MICT's current voting interest in Micronet Limited or Micronet stands at the 37.79%. Therefore, based on the U.S. GAAP rules, MICT no longer report consolidated results due to reduced ownership of Micronet effective March 1, 2019. MICT’s nine months results reported today reflect consolidated Micronet numbers for January 2019 and February 2019 only.Gross loss for MICT was zero for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to gross profit of $54,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2018. R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2019 was zero, as compared to $425,000 for the third quarter of 2018.Selling, general and administrative expenses was $501,000 in the third quarter of 2019, as compared to $2.93 million in the third quarter of 2018. Net loss attributable to MICT was $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2019, as compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2018.I will now turn the call to Moran for a more detailed financial review.
