"Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Turtle Beach first quarter 2021 conference call.  Delivering today's prepared remarks are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juergen Stark; and Chief Financial Officer, John Hanson.   Before we go further, I would like to turn the call over to Sean McGowan of Gateway Investor Relations, Turtle Beach's IR Advisor, as he reads the company's safe harbor that provides important cautions regarding forward-looking statements. Sean, please go ahead.
Sean McGowan: Thank you, Liz. On today's call, we will be referring to the press release filed this afternoon that details the company's first-quarter 2021 results, which can be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at corp.totalbeach.com, where you'll also find the latest earnings presentation that supplements the information discussed on today's call. Finally, a recording of the call will be available on the Investors section of the company's website later today. Please be aware that some of the comments made during this call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law.
Juergen Stark: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're very pleased to report 2021 got off to a great start with another strong quarter. Q1 revenues were up 166% year over year, exceeding expectations as both the market and our products continue to perform very well. Furthermore, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of over $15 million in the quarter and operating cash flow of over $21 million, both of which set records for the first quarter. As we've often said, gaming is a great category in which to be a leader. The past years have now shown two surges that dramatically expanded the base of gamers, gaming headset users, and gaming accessory buyers, both in console and in PC. The first surge in 2018 was driven by Fortnite, and the second in 2020 was driven by stay-at-home orders. In both surges, we outperformed the market and demonstrated excellent execution that leverage those surges to significantly move our business forward.
John Hanson: Hey, thanks, Juergen, and good afternoon to everyone. As Juergen has noted, we continued to see very strong sales momentum, margin expansion, and operating cost leverage during the first quarter of 2021, driving better-than-expected results across all of our financial metrics. Net revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $93.1 million, up 166%, compared to $35 million in the year-ago quarter. This compares to the guidance of $88 million, which we issued in early March. Revenue growth in the first quarter was the result of several factors working together to increase demand, as well as our expanded product offering in the PC accessories category. It is relevant to the year-over-year comparisons that last year, the console market in Q1 was soft, as expected, ahead of the new console launches. This reversed with stay-at-home orders at the end of March. Gross margin in the first quarter was 37.5% of sales. That's 670 basis points higher than the 30.8% we reported in the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by two primary factors: continued lower-than-expected promotional spending and volume-driven fixed-cost leverage. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were $22.6 million, compared to $15.8 million in the same quarter of 2020. The increase was driven by volume-related selling costs, aligning our cost structure to a business that has grown dramatically, as well as investments to expand our PC accessories business and drive future growth.
Juergen Stark: Thanks, John. I'll finish with some comments on what we see for the market and update on our expected results for 2021. To quickly recap our strategy, over the last two years, we have expanded into new categories, significantly increasing our addressable market, and we will continue to add new categories over time. The global gaming market has a $94 billion addressable market in hardware, $188 billion in software, and $3 billion in services.
Operator: Thank you, sir.  And our first question will come from Thomas Forte, D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.
Thomas Forte: Great. So Juergen and John, congrats on an excellent quarter. So one question and one follow-up. So the question I had is, Juergen, I don't want to doubt your projections because you're -- it's one of your core competencies. But if 2021, on a full-year basis, is a year of, call it, elevated demand for gaming accessories, is there a possibility that promotional activity may not return to, for example, a 2019 level, so on that basis, there could be a stronger gross margin and EBITDA than you're currently thinking about? So that's my first question, and then I'll come back with my follow-up.
Juergen Stark: Thanks very much, Tom. That's a great question. We are -- as I mentioned, our guidance is projecting promotional levels to return to normal in Q2, and we're already seeing some signs of that. So we think that's the right way to do our projections. Of course, it's possible that it may not go fully back to normal. And I would just remark that that would be more driven by supply constraints than strong market demand. It's a common misperception that strong market growth or demand drives a reduction in promotions when it's really the supply side that drives the reduction. A very simple example. If you can't get enough supply of your products to meet demand, you are not going to spend extra money to put them on sale or to get additional placements at the front of retail stores, things that go beyond discounting price that are a very typical part of a normal promotional model for consumer electronics.
Thomas Forte: Excellent. Right. And then for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask you, as a longtime industry participant, what your view was on the Epic games versus Apple situation.
Juergen Stark: Well, we're obviously following that closely, Tom, and I respect Epic's desire to challenge the model, but we'll let those guys fight it out and see what happens.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Mark Argento with Lake Street.
Mark Argento: Hi, guys. Congrats on the strong quarter. Just wanted to kind of peel the onion a little bit on your expectations for the second half in terms of the phasing, as you call it. Is the kind of the 2019, kind of what we saw from a quarter-in, quarter-out basis, is that kind of what we should kind of key off of in terms of percentage of business in the various quarters? And then I just wanted to talk about how much your marketing spend are you going to pull forward into Q2.
Juergen Stark: Sure, Mark, happy to answer those questions. So based on Q1 actuals and Q2 guidance and the full-year results, that would put about 42% of revenues in the first half, so leaving 58% in the second half. And we would roughly break that Q3 and Q4 with 20%, 21% of the annual revenues in Q3. We'll guide the second half in August, as we always do. And it's important to keep in mind that revenue can easily flow between those two quarters just based on days of -- differences of order timing. But that's roughly how we think about the phasing.
Mark Argento: That's helpful. And then in terms of the marketing spend, what -- it sounds like you're going to launch a few programs. Is it a substantial pull forward? Just trying to get more of a case of a modeling question, but any thoughts there?
Juergen Stark: Yeah, sure. And I mentioned, actually, it's going to be an exciting couple of months coming up here. We got a lot of launches. PC launches tend to be more spring and early summer-focused versus console, which is later in the year. So given all the products we're launching in PC, you're going to see a lot of activity in Q2 and the associated marketing spend to support them. So that moves, I would say, about $5 million more marketing into Q2 than normal. And it really is just a different phasing of the spend during the year. Just as an example, that would put almost 30% of the marketing spend for the year in total into Q2 versus just under 20% last year.
Mark Argento: Great. Super helpful. And then when you're looking at the growth of the PC business, what are -- in terms of the marketing spend, are you guys -- is that, at retail, kind of marketing spend, get shelf placement? Is that traditional brand advertising? You know, just talk about the go-to-market on PC would be helpful. Thanks.
Juergen Stark: Yeah, sure. So marketing spend covers the gamut. It's promotions with retailers. It is brand building. It's social, web, and digital marketing. It's also some of the partnerships that we've signed up, the quarterly deck covers, a bunch of those, and I just mentioned them. But all of that counts into the marketing spend. And the time to spend that money is upfront when you're launching the product. I equate with the team here to launching a ROCCAT. You got to have enough fuel to get it into orbit, and that's exactly how we're planning our launches.
Operator: Our next question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer.
Juergen Stark: Martin, you might be muted if you're trying to ask a question.
Martin Yang: Oh, sorry, I was indeed muted. Thanks for taking my questions, Juergen and John. So recently, there has been some reports on activist involvement in the company. Can you maybe give us an updated view on how you think about the value of Turtle Beach? I mean, given the exciting growth opportunities ahead of you, would you seriously consider such recommendation? And at what kind of valuation would you engage in a more meaningful conversation with a buyer?
Juergen Stark: Sure. So I have a very clear view on this. The board, me included, is focused on increasing shareholder value, period. That value could come from us continuing to execute on our strategy, which is working quite well, as evidenced by the over 1,000% return we've generated in the past three years, or alternatively, from a transaction that would yield more value to shareholders. And we would always thoroughly and objectively evaluate any potential transaction without, frankly, needing anyone claiming to be pushing us or pushing us to do so. It's a normal part of our fiduciary responsibilities as a board that we take very seriously. You might be on mute again.
Martin Yang: All right. Thanks. No, sorry. Thanks for your answer. You mentioned that during 1Q, there were some investments associated with ROCCAT and new products. Would you consider them one-time investments in the new product categories? Are they -- for instance, if you were to make similar acquisitions or enter into new products, would those cost items recur like what you had in 1Q?
Juergen Stark: Well, two comments. One, the biggest driver of the opex increase is, frankly, the staff and infrastructure to support a business that's tracking to be more than 60% larger than it was in 2019, right? When we hit Q2 of last year, as an organization, you just can't respond quickly enough, and you end up understaffed, under-resourced, under-infrastructured to support the business. So that's the biggest driver of the opex increase for Q1 and going forward. Of course, alongside that, we have marketing campaigns that support any product launches, whether it's in new categories or in our core console market category. And the timing of those launches, when you launch a product, you spend some marketing alongside the launch in all forms, as I just mentioned, to support those launches. So what's a little bit different this year is that we have more of the launches coming earlier in the year. And so that's just shifting some of the marketing spend around a bit.
Martin Yang: Thank you. That makes sense. One more question if I may. Can you talk -- can you maybe give us more details on how much ROCCAT and other products have grown year over year in the first quarter?
Juergen Stark: Yeah. We're not going to provide a lot of detail, but the market, and we're using, as always, NPD U.S. data where we have the most detail, but I'll tell you that other large countries track similarly. So U.S. NPD, the PC gaming categories of headsets, mice, and keyboards grew over 90%. And we way outgrew that. So we said more than doubled that growth rate, but the real number is actually far higher than that, which, for competitive reasons, we don't want to state. So that, to us, is very good demonstration of continued significant progress in our PC growth strategy.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Jack Vander Aarde with Maxim Group.
Jack Vander Aarde: Great. Congrats on the solid results, guys. Juergen and John, thank you for taking my questions. Juergen, just kind of one question for me. Just as I look at -- clearly, you've continued to execute, beat, and raise, outperformed expectations all throughout 2021 and last year. But I want to focus a question on more of the long-term target range just to understand the consistency you expect with all these new market opportunities you're expanding into. I really think that diversifies the business a bit more. So that CAGR range of 10% to 20%, just where you see things today and given the unusual elevated market environment in 2020, just curious how to interpret that growth CAGR range when looking at, say, '22 and 2023. How much of this is a long-term average formula? Or how much of this is like a literal consistent range you think is achievable?
Juergen Stark: Yeah. Great question, Jack. So first of all, our ability to leverage the diversification, the expansion into PC and new product categories to deliver growth after a record 2020 is already a first good testament to the strategy of growing and expanding the TAM working because I think wouldn't have been expected. Growing -- 2022 and onwards, in my view, will actually be easier because we're not going to be comping against a year that certainly had significant kind of first-time buyer effect like 2020 did. So for us, 10% to 20%, it's absolutely a long-term goal. The actual growth, we would expect to move around within those ranges. But we are targeting. And as a management team, we have incentives aligned to outgrowing the market, and we would look to deliver 10-plus percent growth as an average over time.
Jack Vander Aarde: Got it. Understood. And maybe just a follow-up, too. With all these other businesses that you've acquired and you're grooming and scaling up, how do you see just all of these business -- I guess the three markets and maybe the fourth kind of TAM expansion opportunity, how do you see that maybe from like a mix perspective? They're various-size markets here. They're all very large. But five years down the road, is this something where you see a really true, well-balanced portfolio from a revenue-mix perspective?
Juergen Stark: Absolutely. So we're -- this year will likely be more than 10% revenue outside of the core console market. And the core console business for us is obviously huge given that we have nearly half of the market. And it's one of the largest – actually, the largest accessory category of gaming keyboards and mice. And don't look at it as different businesses. These are product ranges that, for the most part, leverage very common infrastructure, common marketing, common supply chain, common retail distribution, all that. So the ability for us to add to the portfolio, and you'll see a few more good examples this year, without significantly complicating our business is very high, right? And so that's how we look at it and how we'll continue to progress the business going forward.
Operator:  We have a question from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer.
Martin Yang: Hi, Juergen. I have a follow-up question on your PC accessories, especially relating to the new product announcements coming from ROCCAT in second quarter. Last year, I think PC access rates also benefited from the stay-at-home trend in the second quarter of 2020. So with new product announcements this quarter, how should we think about the year-over-year cadence or growth? We have the stay-at-home trend offsetting some of the organic growth, but maybe new product will be a bigger positive tailwind for the second quarter. Any comment would be helpful.
Juergen Stark: Sure. So we guided the $70 million of net revenue for Q2. That's a bit below last year's Q2 numbers, keeping in mind that the market -- our sales grew more than 93% in Q2 in 2020, right? So we're getting into a couple of quarters of some tougher comps. But that number is way up over 2019. That's a reflection of the larger market. And even within that number, I don't have all the details in front of me, but I would fully expect our PC business to have grown significantly, even against the very strong market backdrop of last year's Q2.
Operator: Currently, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Stark for closing remarks.
Juergen Stark: Thank you very much. We wish everybody safety and good health as we inch back toward normal. It's going to be an action-packed couple of months of new product announcements, and we look forward to speaking with our investors and analysts when we report our second-quarter results in August. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
