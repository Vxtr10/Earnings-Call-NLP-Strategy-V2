"Operator: Greetings, welcome to the RF Industries Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. . Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Kehrli of MKR Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Todd Kehrli: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to RF Industries second quarter fiscal 2022 financial results conference call. With me on today's call are RF Industries President and CEO, Rob Dawson; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Peter Yin. Before I turn the call over to Rob and Peter, I’d like to cover a few quick items. This morning, RF Industries issued a press release announcing its second quarter fiscal 2022 financial results. That release is available on the company's website at RF Industries.com.  This call is being broadcast live over the internet for all interested parties, and the webcast will be archived on the Investor Relations page of the company website.

I'll now turn the call over to Rob Dawson, President and CEO, Rob?
Rob Dawson: Thank you, Todd. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. It’s nice to not be doing this at 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time for a change. I like to start with a brief review of our second quarter results and then discuss what we are seeing now in the market and what we expect going forward before turning the call over to Peter to give more commentary on the financials. Starting with the second quarter, we’re pleased to report strong revenue growth on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Sales for the quarter came in at $21.5 million, a 27% increase sequentially from Q1 and a 94% increase over the second quarter last year. This growth reflects organic increases in both our revenue and margins in all of our divisions, along with the benefit of two-months of higher margin revenue contribution from our successful acquisition of Microlab that we completed during the quarter. On the bottom line, we reported GAAP net income of $503,000, non-GAAP net income of $1.3 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. We also had some one-time acquisition related charges the second quarter that Peter will share more on later in this call. We're pleased with the organic sales and margin improvement we generated in our legacy business during the quarter. At the same time, we're just a couple months into our integration of Microlab and are excited with what we're seeing. This acquisition is exactly what we thought it would be, and is a perfect fit with what we do both financially and with our business strategy. Microlab contributed two-months of sales to our second quarter generating $3.4 million, which on an annualized basis is more than $20 million in revenue. This is certainly in-line with our expectations and before any major new initiatives that we believe will help drive additional revenue. And they were immediately accretive to both our gross margin and bottom line. We're excited about the expanded customer opportunities we're already seeing with our broader product offering and the expanded relationships that Microlab brings. Microlab’s diverse and complementary product portfolio gives us access to a new set of high performance network operator approved products that we can sell through our growing customer base and through our extensive distribution channel. They also strengthen our market positioning and enhance our customer partnerships bringing additional strong direct and distribution relationships and giving us a higher percentage of the bill of materials in carrier DAS and small cell applications. Microlab has a strong brand and customer list, which provides complementary large and mid-tier carrier customers and enhances our value proposition. The combined company is well-positioned to expand market reach by deepening these existing relationships through cross-selling, while also establishing in-roads with new customers to provide additional scale, improved margins, and further revenue growth. Microlab products are approved by all the carriers and recognized by name and brands. In many cases as the de facto standard on   for venue and small cell deployments. This enables us to not only sell more Microlab products as these projects continue to expand, but to also engage earlier in the planning process with the customer and be a part of the discussion sooner, which we believe will lead to additional opportunities for our legacy and other products built into these bill of materials, particularly for venue and small cell deployments. A lot of Microlab’s products go into small cell shroud and cabinet deployments, which matches perfectly with our strategy and approach with our Schroff Tech small cell products. As we engage in conversations with shared carrier accounts, we're getting a very positive reception from customers when they learn of all the additional products they can get us. We think by leveraging the Microlab brand and being involved earlier in the carrier planning process, we can take our business to the next level by accelerating sales as we integrate our go to market teams and overall sales strategy. Now, let me quickly comment on our existing product areas and market segments and how they performed during the quarter. As I noted earlier, we saw revenue and margin improvement in all of our divisions in the second quarter. Our strong core distribution business continues to perform well and grow. Our RF coaxial cable and connector products and our C-Enterprises faster and fiber products together make up our primary offer sold through distribution. Both of these major product areas showed meaningful year-over-year growth during the quarter, and we expect to see continued steady growth from these two areas throughout the remainder of our fiscal year as we continue to build this baseline of core revenue. Our custom cabling segment, including the Optiflex hybrid fiber products, continues to have strong sales results. As you saw in our press release, we're excited to announce yesterday that we received a multi-million dollar order from a new customer for our hybrid fiber solution in support of a new North American wireless carrier 4G and 5G infrastructure build. This new order also represents a terrific collaboration between the various RF Industries sales teams. As our distribution sales team and our custom cabling technical sales and engineering teams all collaborated to deliver the right solution for this customer. This underscores the strength of our go to market strategy where we want to interact directly with the end customer to include us in the bill of materials and then make it as easy as possible for that customer to purchase through whatever channel makes the most sense. This is the first time in company history that we have multiple concurrent large customers deploying our Optiflex hybrid fiber solution in next generation wireless builds. We received more than $7.5 million in total orders related to this new customer for hybrid fiber, bringing our backlog to more than $34 million as of today. These orders from a new customer are another great win for our Cables Unlimited in Long Island and our Optiflex hybrid fiber solution continues to gain market share in the North American wireless marketplace. With this unique offer and strong value proposition in the market, we believe we're well-positioned to benefit as the overall spend on 4G and 5G deployments continues to increase. Our previous Tier 1 wireless carrier customer continues to draw against their existing purchase orders, and we had a solid quarter of shipments with them in Q2. We also continue to receive new smaller orders from them, including both in the second quarter and already in the third quarter. In addition, in other product areas, we're also finding brand new business with some of the large connectivity manufacturers in the cabling space that have come to rely on us to help augment their current offering. These companies appreciate our specialty in building faster and jumpers and assemblies in both the coaxial and fiber product areas. We're building certain products on their behalf that fit perfectly with the way we're structured and are right in our wheelhouse. This business is expected to represent about $2 million to $3 million or more in future total additional revenue per year and is becoming a bigger piece of our total business. So overall, our custom cabling continues to be strong and is a healthy piece of our business overall. And with our broad set of specialty products and value proposition of fast turn very specialized cable assemblies, we're finding additional new opportunities with our increased sales and marketing efforts to scale our business through expansion with our existing customers, as well as new business with some new mid-tier players beyond the carrier market. Turning to our small cell and DAC thermal cooling offerings, these continue to be huge opportunities that we expect will increase sales this year and next. The pipeline continues to build and we have a strong backlog of orders. We have a product actively shipping to several key small cell players, as well as ongoing discussions regarding future deployments with others. We've also been engaged in discussions with Tier 1 carriers and others about our DAC offerings and expect to see those conversations come to a head in the next quarter or two. Small cell continues to be strong and a healthy piece of our business. While small cell spending is not – is still not at the full level we expect it to be for all the reasons that we've talked about in the past, many of the projects that we've seen hanging out there for a while have started to come through and we're seeing some sales from those. While we're also winning project work with venues in large stadiums. And as I mentioned earlier, Microlab also has a large bill of materials in small cell and has been seeing this work increase too. So, we're winning some great small cell business and see some significant upside going forward. On the topic of small cells, last month we launched our innovative new small cell concealment solution called TruField, which expands our market opportunity with a proprietary new product we can sell to our growing customer base of wireless carriers and neutral host providers to meet the growing demand of 5G networks. TruField utilizes the proprietary outer shell material that can be configured to fit any small cell or current millimeter wave radio on the market and has gone through extensive independent lab and wireless carrier testing to provide true RF transparency across all frequencies. The material is lightweight and flexible and unzips to provide 360-degree access for easy installation, upgrades, and removal. This makes it much easier for technicians to work on, so it requires less people to physically go out and do the work, which is an important competitive advantage because of the number of available people in that technical field is a constrained resource and we see it continuing that way for some time. Looking back on the delays in small cell over the past couple of years, we believe we've actually benefited from this timing that has given us time to somewhat reinvent and strengthen our capabilities and product offerings. We're in a much stronger position now to get built into the deployments, we might have otherwise missed had they happened earlier. Now, turning to the topic of acquisitions. We're effectively complete with our integration of Microlab and they're now operating as part of our team. As we focus on our organic growth plans and layering in additional strategic acquisitions, we believe there are opportunities to do more and are seeing a strong deal flow. We're continuing to look for further larger acquisitions that fit our strategic plan of acquiring good quality companies with passive components that allow us to offer more of the bill of materials in key applications and that will provide us with access to new products that we can sell through both new channels and our existing and growing distribution channel. Finally, let me take a moment to discuss some of our goals for the rest of this year and going forward in future fiscal years. As we've discussed in the past, we have an internal goal to return our gross margins to 30% or higher. Because we have a lot of operating leverage in our business, we can deliver higher sales numbers with very little needed investments in SG&A. So with our sales and gross margins both increase, we have the goal of getting our adjusted EBITDA to 10% of sales or greater in the near term. As we grow, we believe we have even further upside to those numbers. As we discussed earlier in the current results, we delivered 28% gross margins and adjusted EBITDA was 9.3% of sales. We're not far from our immediate goals and we feel that we're getting better operationally even with the continuing headwinds in the macro environment. If we look out three to five years, we believe we can continue to grow profitably through both organic and inorganic initiatives. We've shown that we're diligent about our capital allocation and continue to provide strong returns on that invested capital. The Microlab acquisition is a great example of that as we showed immediate accretion from the deal in both sales and profit margins. We did this deal using low cost debt and have been successful at driving profitable growth while avoiding dilution. This kind of focus gives us aspirational goals of taking our adjusted EBITDA to levels even higher than 10% of sales in coming years. As we look to the second half of the year, we're increasing our guidance for fiscal 2022 annual revenue from 75 million to 80 million, which will include approximately eight months of Microlab revenue this fiscal year. And with this expected 40% increase in full-year revenue versus fiscal year 2021, we continue to expect significant growth in our adjusted EBITDA as our profitability increases through the remainder of the year with the goal of getting back to 30% gross margins and getting 10% of sales dropping through to adjusted EBITDA. Overall, we're excited about the continued growth we're generating in our core business and the significant opportunities we're seeing through our Microlab acquisition for additional scale, overall margin and profitability improvement, and further revenue growth. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Peter for a review and discuss of the financial results for the quarter. Peter?
Peter Yin: Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report revenue growth on both the sequential and year-over-year basis, along with improved margins and profitability. Sales in the second quarter were $21.5 million, up 27% sequentially from the first quarter and up 94% from the second quarter last year or up 64%, excluding Microlab sales. Our gross profit margin was 28%, up sequentially from 24% in the first quarter and up from 27% in the second quarter last year, which excludes the impact of the employee retention tax credit recognized in last year's Q2. Our revenue increase and improved gross margins for the second quarter reflect organic growth in all our divisions, along with the benefit of two-months of higher margin revenue contribution from Microlab. Excluding the contribution from Microlab, the business remains profitable even with the one-time charges of $637,000 that was recognized during the quarter. As we have noted previously, we continue to experience a series of cost headwinds, primarily related to the state of the supply chain that have put pressures on our margins. We have been taking steps to address these headwinds, which includes working with our customers on updated pricing, purchasing inventory at larger quantities, placing our orders much sooner, and at a locked-in price. We increased our inventory position significantly in the second quarter, up 42% or   from Q1 and up 71% or $8 million from Q2 last year. The acquisition of Microlab accounted for 3.9 million of the inventory increase. We believe that inventory availability is extremely important in our markets, especially in times of supply chain volatility and as our sales are increasing. Our approach of targeted inventory increases allows us to better support our customers' needs and stay ahead of some of the delays and extended lead times we are seeing in similar product areas from some of our competitors. With these efforts, and a full quarter of contribution of higher margin revenue from Microlab in the current third quarter, we expect to see our gross margins continue to further improve throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Turning to our balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents were $3.8 million and working capital was $27 million at the end of the second quarter. Our cash balance reflects the cash used in the second quarter to pay a portion of the Microlab purchase price and the additional one-time acquisition related charges. As I noted on the last call, a portion of our acquisition of Microlab, we secured low cost debt, which included a $3 million revolving credit facility and a $17 million term loan at ] interest. While this debt is something new to the company, we maintain a healthy cash flow and the acquisition of the Microlab business more than covers our monthly debt service. The company has not drawn from the available $3 million revolver. Adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was $2 million, up from adjusted EBITDA of $355,000 in the second quarter last year. As I mentioned earlier, the company incurred additional one-time charges of $637,000 in the second quarter. These charges primarily consisted of acquisition related, legal, and investment banker fees. Additionally, we continue the integration of Microlab and further consolidate our operations and physical manufacturing footprint. We anticipate other potential one-time charges that will ultimately allow us to achieve key cost synergies. Backlog was $27.6 million at April 30, on second quarter bookings of $18.8 million. As of today, backlog stands at more than $34 million. Turning to our outlook. As Rob noted, we are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2022 from annual revenue greater than $75 million to annual revenue of $80 million, which includes eight months of Microlab revenue this fiscal year. And with this expected 40% increase in full-year revenue versus fiscal year 2021, we continue to expect our profitability to continue to further improve throughout the remainder of the year with the goal of getting back to 30% gross margins and getting 10% of sales dropping through to adjusted EBITDA. That concludes my discussion. Operator, we are ready to take our first question.
Operator: Thank you.  First question is coming from Josh Nichols with B. Riley. Josh, your line is live.
Josh Nichols: Yes, thanks for taking my question and great to see things are off to a strong start with Microlab. Just curious, so the company has bumped up its guidance and you've been pretty clear that you think the second half is probably going to be stronger than the first year. I'm just curious how much of that $34 million of backlog today expected to kind of flow through the income statement in the back half versus how much is going to be left for next year?
Rob Dawson: Yes. Thanks, Josh. I appreciate the question. So, it's tough to tell, I guess, is the short answer. I think our general expectation with our backlog is something around 50% of it is actionable in the short-term, which is usually within a quarter or two. The other 50% could be longer than that. And again, those are kind of historical ways that we look at it. It's somewhat unprecedented for us to be sitting again at a backlog of above $30 million, you know as long as we have, you know we even want to drop to 27, that's still a gigantic number against our total sales. So, I think our expectation is that we can clearly, sort of see half or a little better of that going out the door. That doesn't get us to the numbers we need for the rest of the year, which is where our book and ship business comes in that generally doesn't show up in the backlog. You pick any snapshot in time and it's hard to capture that daily book and ship. So, I think we expect to enter even through the next couple of quarters. We expect to enter next fiscal year still with some nice backlog to go out, specifically against some of these hybrid fiber orders, as well as some of the project orders that we're seeing now around the larger venue and related builds.
Josh Nichols: And then just a follow-up on that. Again, nice to see the win for the hybrid fiber from actually a new customer, right? You previously got a couple wins from one-to-one wireless carrier, I guess if you could elaborate a little bit on what's the genesis about that relationship? Is that something that you've been working on for a while? Does it come through the Microlab acquisition and opportunity to build on that?
Rob Dawson: Yes, good question. So, this is one that our team has been working on for some time. It was a new relationship going back a year or two, but we have account management that maintains relationships and makes sure that we're uncovering opportunities for the entire offer. And when something is discovered, you want to bring in the right resource to help close it. This was not an opportunity that we were fully aware of even going back a quarter and a half or so. So, go back four or five months and I don't think we were nearly as clear on what this was – the potential was here. So, our sales team did a great job of staying in touch. It's the same sales team we've had in place with some of the shift that we made going back four or five years ago to get people aligned with specific accounts both direct and distribution. And so from that, uncovered some opportunities brought in the team that is experts in these product areas and in the go to market in those specific products, and led to some nice business. And so it wasn't a complete unknown for us, but I think it was one that, sort of shows the strength of our go to market that we're trying to cover both distribution and direct with the right resources and then collaborate the best we can to drag in as much as we can around our offer. So, in a perfect world, every carrier is buying every piece of our offer. That's not practical, but we want to make sure we're winning the things that are realistic for us and this is one that our track record of good performance in hybrid fiber with other customers, other big wireless carriers in the North American space have really helped us have a pedigree now in that world. And so that printed through in some nice new business for us.
Josh Nichols: And then you touched on it during the call, but wanted to follow-up, so I know small cell deployments have been slower than for last year or so, but it seems like you are engaged with the customers there, maybe there's some early stage wins, but I guess what's kind of the revenue opportunity there for the back half and potentially next year and also if you could kind of hit on some of the direct air cooling opportunities as well or what you’re seeing in the market today?
Rob Dawson: Yes. So, on the small cell side, it's getting tougher for us to nail a number on that. When we're talking, Schroff Tech integrated small cell cabinets, that's a much easier thing to quantify, which we're seeing growth from a few million bucks and sort of when we made that acquisition, we're expecting that to grow certainly into next year, but what is harder to quantify is a lot of Microlab products go into small cell deployments. Some of that goes through distribution. Some of that goes to neutral host kinds of companies. So, it's not always easy for us to tell, but I think we view the opportunity with that along with TruField, the new shroud that we launched. I think we'd be disappointed if we weren't able to start quantifying a small cell overall offer that's showing 30%, 40%, 50% kind of increases, which would put us up. We're probably doing all-in, I don't know, $12 million, $15 million, it's just, sort of extrapolating from our total results of things going into small cell kinds of deployments. We believe that that's one of those applications we could be doing a ton more certainly going into next year as we hope that spend increases a little better and normalizes. I think on the DAC thermal cooling side, we've got some things in the works right now, discussions with customers and future looking long-term projects that I would say the same thing. I'd be disappointed if that product line wasn't giving us $6 million, $8 million, $10 million a year in sales. It's certainly available in the market, but it's a significant go to market and sales exercise for us. A lot of those things as we've talked about we had to productize it to make it a little more understandable and marketable across all the different markets and channels.  Now that we've done that, and had that in place and some marketing materials to go with it, I think the next generation product lines that match current needs certainly have that opportunity to put up those kinds of numbers for us. So, when we look at growth, those are two key areas obviously in our offer. That could be some big purchase orders and long-term projects similar to what we do on the hybrid fiber side. So, adding more of those kinds of opportunities should help smooth out some of the lumpiness in our quarter-to-quarter results.
Josh Nichols: Yes. And then I guess any one or two big opportunities that may not be in the backlog that could be hanging out there for potential wins, just thinking more about Microlab? I know they do a lot of work with like outdoor venues and things that are clearly back in   now that the COVID concerns have relieved. I'm just curious about the opportunity on that front.
Rob Dawson: Yes. So that's a great one. I think when we look, when we closed that acquisition and we talked to trailing 12-month sales of, call it, $17 million, I think that was artificially low based on – there was really no project work in there for some of these venues. And I think along with those coming back and an enhanced go to market focus and strategy with existing Microlab customers, as well as some of the relationships that RF Industries had legacy wise, we absolutely see growth opportunity for the business. I mean, we just – in two months did 3.4 million, you annualize that it's a little over $20 million in the Microlab business area. I've said all along, I thought this was a normalized $20 million to $22 million a year "
