The key large segment that drive our systems business improved, starting with 23.5% of total revenue, up 10% from last year and 24% from last quarter, against average sales to the [indiscernible] decline in market those performed strongly. We are seeing an increased number of customers as up to all fresh NVM solution and expect strong NVM system growth in 2017. Internet data center and cloud comprised 12.8% of total revenue, down from 25% last year and down from 18% last quarter. We took some times in the past couple of quarters to review our pipeline in this segment. Now we are at with product therefore it would nice with better dilute. We are expecting win in this â€“ in the near future in this large board of segment. Despite early fair in some margin pressure, we are confident that how datacenter will continue and grow our economical scale in last year. IoT and embedded comprised 10.7% of total revenue and was up 12.9% over last year and up 10.2% from last quarter. A key driver of our success is been the focus on that case in IoT and embedded themes that dive our business. From a geographical perspective, Europe and Asia show strong improvement from last year, with Europe contributing 21.5% of revenue and Asia contributing 18.2%. The US market was 55.0% of revenue, representing ARC balance of US and international revenue. Last quarter we discussed the restructuring of our global operation on inward ratio, including our new SAP implementation, tax restructure and bonded warehouse. This quarter was so much smoother operation and reduced impact from the transition. We expect to 100% complete of that transition in this December quarter and see sustained long-term improvement to our operational efficiency and probability. Now IoT us structural market is experiencing moderate growth according to most of the analyst. But particular segment of the market growing three to four times faster than the overall market. Most of our focus is on the faster growing market segment, like the next generation storage, high density and pre-architectural, rest to be our services embedded and IoT and X-rapid GPU computing. Not other company is better positioned in these market segment, which we are creating big growth opportunity for our business. Our portfolio of workload optimized systems deliver tangible performance and efficiency advantage and we are consistently foster to market with key new technology innovation, that enable our customer to deliver depreciative more powerful and efficient solution. Super Micro is a leader in the next generation storage market, providing NVM all fresh NVM and high storage solution to our customers, including the top storage OENs. We have most completed storage portfolio with more than 70 NVM server storage systems, that deliver all those magnitude better performance multiple times the price performance and vision and traditional storage solutions, including a simple pre-architecture and 60 page and 90 page capacity optimized storage platforms using that new tool and do the NVM interface. We continue to define the stay order at architecture by introducing the first 2U 4A fresh NVM solution with growth system and data pass redundancy bring all fresh NVM to the mission critical enterprise. As a result of our 20 year strategy and investment storage has become one of our largest revenue and faster growing segments. In Rack Scale data center we saw outstanding growth in the quarter while center introduced a micro pace of that. We have several major larger scale customers wins for micro [ph] that were based on micro combination of high performance, high density and networking and IoT efficiency. We also continue to offer most innovative multiple system portfolio including the twin family and [indiscernible] and had consistent growth of that portfolio with particularly strong growth for our micro pace. The rate IQ was special my next hearing market a gross according to most of the entities five particular segments of the Maki growing three full-time fosters in the overall market. Most of our focus is on the foster growing market segments next-generation stories-between potential Rexdale, solutions invented and IOT and X-rated GPU computing not the company is in addition to the things make segment visual Michael, which we have created the gross opportunity for our our credit portfolio of local optimized season fever principal performance and efficiency advantage and we are consistent at 84 circle Maki we skied knowledge innovations that enable our customer for the vitiated more powerful and efficient solutions, supermicro is either in the next generation story to my providing an BMD all flash and we in hybrid storage solution for our customers, including the hot storage organs in the war you have the most the company discourage for you. We want to 7 PM EMV the seasons that deliver orders of magnitude performance, multiple times the price performance and divisions traditional storage solutions including the simply double our actual and the CPP in that space capacity optimized us stories"" using Matthew who and who and what have you interface defined us.

How does it. So outstanding growth in the quarter, lower basin the use Michael Brady we had as they were amid your large-scale customers of for Michael Brady that will based on the MicroCloud combination of high-performance-and networking in I yields of low for the policies the most the innovative Maki Pelosi simple for you, including the Queen 73 and Michael Kyle and consistent most of that for weeks, particularly strong growth for Michael, that involve our new away as well underway, and we are starting the transition. I think for and I am working - we've got customers in our teeth amount is over 30 years and for of presentation order next-generation policies which we announced next year and we continue to see hundred percent gross of our software, especially as management sort away in global service portfolio, providing a deputy the speaking and 44 our expanding enterprise customer base our IOT and embedded again, a provider one or the right path or a quarter, we grew approximately three times faster than the overall IOT market as measured by IDC our new reform fiscal junkie and composite provide a higher performance that the The higher performance VCC do that I know you customer networking, communication and stories you reach your more powerful the solution. We also expanded our mine leasing you though power is one of solutions. We successful customer engagement including the medical imaging security is manufacturing and elsewhere. So we expect to see a 30% cost gross in IOT and embedded this fiscal year. We had every share leadership below in the computing and I and 30 in every all the any machine learning and I think we should solution and provide a complete portfolio almost Nvidia in base and what a broad scale adoption of X-rated.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. In summary our outlook for December quarter, we had a fixed our seasonality expectations. The backlog in a stronger gross now much segment we expect these quarter see you contribution and nine installment demand for modest always Michael Brady and that's you accelerated computing and not be surgeon not demand in the college and innocent mall over the expecting the completion of our new global operation was we were achieve that and some improvements to our efficiency in the public. Indeed, we are very excited about phase the market opportunity. And at the other companies in a position, we in the idea was special market. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.

Rich Kugele: Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions, so I guess first clarification, Howard Can you repeat the growth rates for next in enterprise and HPC, HPC particular I didn't catch it sounded like it was some of the hundred percent is clarify that?
Howard Hideshima: Rich, on a year-over-year basis NextGen towards enterprise and HTC in the 36.9% next doors are .7% for 597.5% for the cable and sequential bit NextGen NextGen storage grew at 26.6% and 21.8%. Our practice is to our point okay the PC side is there any commentary you can provide likely the particular environment is going into the unique configurations you can talk to really nice with educational area would think of the 51.
Rich Kugele: With regards HPC area that was on the out the platform and was very pleased okay. And then in terms of just where we are in the process recycle. Can you talk about demand for the current series of Intel products and any in the early indications on demand for the future launches next year earlier go and 95 most have been?
Howard Hideshima: GPU and 900 and much and then you said available so we have a strong mine oboes the quarter was company and we expect that gross us to in the including not local and ENG for enterprise. We had a strongest product line that will not be the 40 great in growing model okay. And so your sense of how to LNG. Now with Nvidia and until most now we see excellent the queue. Thanks very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. And congratulations on a strong quarter. Great gross margin and good guidance here. impressive the concept of datacenter sales were down 47% year-over-year and 29% to so you talk a little further about why that ourselves continues to decline on a Q-o-Q basis?
Howard Hideshima: Thank you for the kind remarks, we talked about it the quarter as we thought it build out and data centers all last year for cellulose build out that I have been gone for staying Outlook and will technology refresh and demand for your additional client into the data center again audio talk about that within our guided we have great opportunity there to grow as as we go pipeline in that area yeah. So, I like men know you have a one-off most those on the full view quarter. Mike stated, we did not I would say I'm not a couple of floods the site in the private I get into the local and the fees will be.
