"Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Harmonic Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maisha, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Carolyn Aver, Chief Financial Officer, you may begin.
Carolyn V. Aver: Thank you, hello everybody. With me at our headquarters in San Jose, California is Patrick Harshman our CEO. I would like to point out that in addition to the audio portion of this call; we’ve also provided slides, which you can see by going to investor relations page of harmonicinc.com and clicking the third quarter earnings call button. Now turning to slide two, let me remind you that during this call, we will provide projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We must caution you that such statements are only current expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents of Harmonic files with the SEC included our most recent 10-Q report and the forward-looking statement section of today’s earnings press release. These documents identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, the financial metrics we provide you on this call are determined on a non-GAAP basis. These items together with corresponding GAAP numbers and a reconciliation to GAAP are contained in today’s earnings press release, which we’ve posted on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. We will also discuss historical, financial and other statistical information regarding our business and operation. Some of this information is included in the press release and the remainder of the information will be available in a recorded version of this call on our website. With that let me turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Harshman: Thanks, Carolyn, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Turning now to our slide three, today we reported our results for the third quarter 2012, which were in line with our guidance issued a quarter ago and sequentially up from the second quarter. In the context to continuing macroeconomic challenges, these results reflect our focus on improving operation execution and gaining market share. We are also making the right strategic moves and investments to position the company for a stronger long-term growth. With that as background revenue was $136.7 million, driven by a healthy demand from our global cable customers. Good execution on services related international projects. Demand from cable operators was particularly strong for Edge and Access products, where we believe we continue to gain market share. Record services and support revenue reflected growing revenue recognized on multi period projects, booked in prior quarters. Reflecting continuing macroeconomic headwinds, new bookings were $128.7 million, down sequentially. In particular, new orders from Europe were down over 15% year-over-year. Yet despite this we believe we gained market share in Europe, particularly in Cable, Edge and Access and in multi-screen. We gained some of number of new customer wins. In contrast to Europe, we did see solid year-over-year growth in new orders from Asia, in other emerging markets. And as a result year-to-date book-to-bill is still greater than one and we head into the fourth quarter with a healthy backlog. Turning to operating performance our gross margins were 48%, slightly better than the second quarter, but still below our target, due to product mix, and geographic makeshift towards emerging markets. Operating expenses were approximately $55 million in the quarter, and non-GAAP earnings were $0.07 per share. We again had robust cash performance generating approximately $22 million in cash from operations during the quarter. Resulting in the cash balance increase of approximately $14 million, after using approximately $7.4 million for our share repurchase program. Carolyn will provide additional details on these operating results, and our repurchase activity in just a few minutes. So turning now to slide four, I like to provide a little bit more color on the quarter beginning with our international business, which accounted for 58% of revenue. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to see macroeconomic headwinds impacting the market in Europe. New orders from the region declining both sequentially and year-over-year. On the other hand we saw strong growth in Asia and other emerging markets. Despite these macroeconomic differences, the business and investment trends playing out internationally have some common themes. We continue to see a migration to Pay TV business models and corresponding Digital TV and HDTV technology development trends that are really still in the early innings. For example, during the quarter The Wall Street Journal noted in an article by Liberty Global’s opportunities in Europe. But today, it’s still less than 10% of German households pay for premium TV services. So we see the ongoing penetration of Pay TV and Digital TV services driving demand for our traditional video processing products for the foreseeable future. We’re also seeing more video content and television channels being created for local audiences around the globe, which drives demand for our production playout products. In fact, the third quarter was the strongest year-to-date for our production playout products, and particularly strong demand coming again from Asia. And in both Europe and Asia, we also closed several multi-screen deals in support of more advanced operators rolling out over the top services. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong demand and improving the revenue recognized related to our services and support capabilities across international markets. And finally here, the competitive landscape in our markets is today more influx than in any point, I’ve seen previously. Several of the companies we compete with it for sale in private equity hands and strategic turning points or some combination of all these. In this context, our customers view it as reliable, focused, and innovative market leader positioning Harmonic to gain additional market share in the coming quarters. So let’s now turn to the U.S. markets. In slide five where we continue to see strong demand from our domestic cable and telco customers. Demand from domestic satellite operators and media companies was down year-over-year. Underlying the strong cable demand, this competitive momentum in the edgeQAM and optical access space and accelerating cable network demand for high capacity Video on Demand and high-speed data services. Our newer HectoQAM product with industry-leading density is a great solution and for the first time, we saw HectoQAM shipments exceed those of our previous generation edge products. Turning to our video processing product area, we see the growing imperative of bandwidth efficiency also creating opportunity for competitive differentiation of our encoding, and transcoding products, across both traditional and new media, our multi-screen formats. our combination of exceptional video quality and bandwidth efficiency is increasingly valued and enabling competitive advantage. Well, our customers are generally still struggling to find the right business model necessary to justify volume investments in multi-screen and over the top capabilities. When they are investing, increasingly strong product set is enabling us to gain share. And regarding market share, my prior comments about the opportunities presented by the evolving competitive environment is equally valued in the U.S. as it is overseas. Sustained with this theme of new media and turning out to slide 6. I’d like to briefly highlight ways Harmonic demonstrated industry leadership during the quarter to our customer partnerships to bring coverage of the 2012 London Olympics to the world to thousands of networks and to millions of screens. As was previously announced in separate press releases, our technology was at the heart of the media workforce of a number of companies including the BBC and Virgin Media in the UK and NBC here in the U.S. In particular, our MediaGrid shared storage solution was deployed to enable editing in live production environments. Our Electra encoder was widely deployed around the globe for super high-quality widescreen HD services. In our ProMedia Suite, software based video processing products were widely deployed for both large multi-screen delivery, and off-line file transferring for on-demand access to the events. Our work also included in important industry first. the first live public trial of the new MPEG-DASH adaptive bitrate streaming stem enabling public broadcaster VRT in Belgium to deliver high-quality Olympic experience to its customers’ personal devices. So let’s turn now to slide seven. While strengthening industry leadership has also been recently recognized by a series of meaningful awards including CSI’s Best Mobile TV Technology Award or ProMedia Suite, TV Technology Europe STAR award for powerful and ProMedia Xpress transcoding plans; three, BTR Diamond Technology Award given at the recent SCTE cable show in Orlando. In our second Emmy to be formally awarded at CES in January, we’ll work on the development and commercialization of digital local cable ad insertion. Now all awards don’t pay bills, they do send a clear message to our customers and partners that Harmonic is a uniquely focused, innovative, and capable industry leader and business partner. And regarding technology innovation, Harmonic has continued to invest quite heavily in new technology and products, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment that has impacted our top line issue. We’ve continued to invest, because we strongly believe there are several coming technology disruptions that we are uniquely positioned to lead and benefit from over the next several years. So to finish up the discussion here, I’d like to highlight a couple of the initiatives we’re investing in that we believe we’re going to be significant growth drivers for our business. So with that, now turning to slide eight, the first major investment area, emerging growth driver, I’d like to discuss is the cable agency CAP, CCAP or Converged Cable Access Platform is the convergence of the video and high-speed data edge into a common platform. massively, increasing cable ahead and efficiency and density, and therefore, making the transition of this technology, high priority customer initiatives for the foreseeable future. From a business perspective, this convergence combines the addressable markets for the cable edgeQAM and CMTS into one significantly expanding the revenue opportunity for Harmonic and making our anticipated early market entry with a true CCAP compliant platform, a meaningful competitive advantage. In one of our biggest product launches ever, we showcased our new NSG Pro platform, designed for CCAP from the ground up at the recent SCTE cable show in Orlando and disclosed that it is already in customer lab trials. The product initially targets downstream comm-only applications. The development of full two-way data capability is well underway and our customers seem generally excited about this product. And turning now to slide nine, I’d like to highlight two new video trends that we believe may also fundamentally reshape video infrastructure over the next several years. First, we’re starting to see the industry seriously look beyond today’s HD to even higher quality formats, namely Ultra HD or 4K, so named because the picture has horizontal resolution of approximately 400 pixels providing dramatically more detail in today’s HD services. Camera technology and television supporting 4K are just beginning to emerge, and like 3D, the question really is whether the experience warrants the investment. I believe that to several of our key customers, 4K has a much stronger chance of success from 3D, as it offers a really powerful and compelling visual experience without the need for special glasses et cetera. Tomorrow remains to be seen how this Ultra HD opportunity will play out. Should it gain traction? The video infrastructure implications would be tremendous, from playout servers to encoding, from storage to streaming. 4K Ultra HD represents the significant long-term opportunity for Harmonic. And more certain is the opportunity we see in High Efficiency Video Coding or HEVC, which we expected to be adopted MS over the next several years driving a large scale technology refresh across our customer base. HEVC essentially has the bandwidth requirement for an encoded video stream, which makes it extremely compelling for both Ultra HD delivered to the living room. More and more immediately and perhaps, importantly, the high quality standard definition and high definition video delivered over bandwidth constrained mobile and Internet networks. We’ve been showing customers early demonstrations of this technology over the past couple of months. And they’ve been simply blown away by the quality of the video that we can deliver with still few beds. We see a broad up way to opportunity playing out. beginning the second half of 2013, we’re investing now to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity. So in summary, Harmonic is continuing to sharpen our focus on near-term execution. We’ll also continue to invest the longer-term market leadership, the fundamental growth opportunities. With that, Carolyn, I’ll turn the call back over to you for your remarks in the third quarter and to share outlook for the fourth quarter.
Carolyn V. Aver: Thank you, Patrick. Moving to FY ‘10, our net revenue for the third quarter was $136.7 million, an increase of 3% from the second quarter and 2% below last year’s third quarter. Our bookings were $128.7 million lower than the second quarter bookings by $10.8 million. However, our book-to-bill for the year is still over one to one. Non-GAAP gross margin improved from Q2 to 48%, but are still below last year’s gross margin of 50.6%. The decrease in the gross margin is largely due to product mix issues as well as the shifted revenue to emerging markets. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2012 were $54.8 million, up 2% from the previous quarter and a year ago. Our head count was 1,155 at the end of the third quarter, up eight from the end of the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $8.1 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to the $7.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $12.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2011. Turning to slide 11. let’s look at our quarterly revenue and backlog in more detail. As noticed, net revenue for the third quarter was $136.7 million, an increase of 3% from the second quarter and 2% below last year’s third quarter. On the other hand, our backlog and deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was $137.7 million, a decrease from $146 million last quarter, but an increase from the $125.4 million a year ago. In the past two quarters, our bookings have exceeded revenue principally due to increased service booking. This quarter, we began to recognize some of those service projects. Moving to slide 12, our international revenue represented 58% of total revenue in the third quarter, compared to 51% in the same period of 2011. This increase is primarily a result of strong growth in Asia-Pacific and some emerging market growth, offset in part by year-over-year declines in Europe. For the third quarter, video processing represented 37% of our total revenue and production and playout represented 17%, slightly up from recent quarters. Our Edge and Access business represented 29% of our total revenue. Our Edge and Access business continues to perform well. As Patrick mentioned, our high-density HectoQAM shipment, exceeded our previous generation shipments for the first time. We also saw a sequential uptick in our Access business as cable bandwidth constrains drive demand. Service revenue represented 17% of total revenue and grew 20% from the second quarter and 35% from last year’s third quarter. Services in general and professional services specifically have been an area of focus for us. This quarter’s revenue represents the successful completion of several projects. I do expect that service revenue will decrease slightly in Q4. Our largest customer for the quarter was again Comcast at 13% of revenue in the third quarter. None of our other customers were over 10% of revenue. Our cable customers represented 50% of our business, reflecting our strong Edge and Access sale. Our satellite and telco customers represented 20% of sales, and our broadcast and media customers 30% of sales in the third quarter. As you can see on slide 13, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $192 million, up $14.2 million from the end of the prior quarter despite $7.4 million in stock repurchases. Our receivable balance was $94.6 million and DSOs were 63 days, down from last quarter’s 70 days, reflecting a strong collections effort. Inventory was $68.3 million; up slightly from the prior quarter as a result our inventory turns were slightly up to 4.2%. Capital spending was $3.3 million in the third quarter and we expect CapEx for 2012 to be in the $14 million to $16 million range. Finally, we repurchased 1.65 million shares for $7.4 million during the quarter on the share repurchase plan that was implemented in the second quarter. Turning to slide 14, while we are encouraged by our healthy backlog and customer demand in most regions moving into Q4, we still face uncertain visibility regarding Europe. Additionally, we anticipate some of our Edge and Access revenue as certain customer projects are completing. Taking all of this into consideration we expect net revenue to be on range of $132 million to $142 million in Q4. Non-GAAP gross margins in the fourth quarter are anticipated to be in the range of 48% to 50%. Our targets for non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter is $55 million to $56.5 million reflecting increase sales expenses as we near year-end as well as increased legal costs relating to the sending two lawsuits. Finally we anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate for 2012 to be in the 25% to 26% range depending on the amount of our international verse domestic income for the year. The rate assumes the R&D tax credit has not yet been extended. With that I’ll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.
Patrick Harshman: Well, thanks Carolyn. In summary we believe Harmonic is executing well, gaining market share in a challenging environment, making dibble investments in significant growth opportunities. Regardless of the near-term macro situation we continue to broaden our customer base across geographies and to our clear technology leadership including delivering on our new CCAP and HEVC initiatives, and driving market leading IP multiscreen solution capabilities. With the focused global staff and strengthening strategic relationships with industry leading service providers and media customers, we are confident in our ability to execute. With that we’ll end the formal portion of the call, Carolyn and I would be pleased to answer any questions which you have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) First question is from James Kisner with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
James M. Kisner: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just generally, I just want to start with the big picture question here, so I can sort of understand that, what’s going on in the business right now, very generally high level. I mean your bookings were down and I appreciate year-to-date that the book-to-bill is above 1, but they are down this quarter, and you’re still guiding up sequentially, so obviously it sounds like you’re planning to burn some backlog here in a seasonally strong Q4. Mission is curious, is that all Europe, is there any chance for some budget for election with America, Comcast has implied a pretty strong ramp in the back half. could you just sort of elaborate a little bit more on that in the current business environment?
Patrick Harshman: Look, it’s challenging in many parts of the world including Europe. And we don’t expect that to change in the fourth quarter, James. and I’d say more broadly, including in the U.S., we see a fair amount of conservatism and careful spending. So our guidance for the fourth quarter doesn’t contemplate that much budget cost activity. As you’ve pointed out, and as we’ve pointed out, bookings were sequentially down in the quarter, a little bit of that is around timing, but also reflecting continuing slow activity in Europe. That being said, as we also pointed out, we’re quite encouraged by the growth that we saw in Asia and in other markets, and we continue to see that whenever the cable operator spends, they’re spending and increasingly with us, particularly in the U.S. So it’s a little bit of a mix bag, I recognized that, but putting all the puts and takes together, we feel so we’re well positioned to deliver, let’s say another in line quarter and the extend that the market improves above and beyond that. We think we’re extremely well positioned.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Richard Ingrassia with Roth Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
Richard Ingrassia: Hi, good afternoon everybody. Patrick, can you say a little bit more about the CCAP opportunity. What do you think, you might have to must have product for that initiative, if it’s something other than being first to market, and maybe, if you could size the addressable opportunity over the next two or three years?
Patrick Harshman: Yeah. So there’s a couple of things, Richard. first, we do think we have extremely a strong technology that positions us very well. Understand we’re not coming out of this market from out of the blue; we’re coming at it from being the market leader in edgeQAM technology. A key aspect, if not got key aspect and fill the CCAP value proposition or architecture is density of QAMs. Here we lead the market with our edgeQAM product and the product that we announced and will be shipping in the first quarter is significantly ahead of any other product that’s been announced or that the market currently anticipates. So we comment from the places having extremely strong QAM of credentials and the leadership and the response from our customers has been extremely positive. We are excited about the opportunity. We have a lot of work to do, but we see our customers very focused here and confident in our ability to succeed. We’ve been working closely with them from the beginning. We asked about the size of the opportunity, there is a number of market research studies out there, kind of the red boxes about $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year, incremental opportunity that we currently don't address, that is above and beyond a pure just QAM market. So it’s substantial opportunity for us it’s why we are investing as heavily as we are and why we are as focused as we're in this space.
Richard Ingrassia: Okay thanks for that. And a question on gross margin, if I can. You mentioned why the makeshift drove non-GAAP margins a little lower and your expectations for Q3, but Q4 hence actually suggests a decent increased over the last few years. Can you explain what's changing in your expectations, here in Q4 or is it backlog per annum or something more we should be watching?
Carolyn V. Aver: So I think it’s I mentioned that Edge and Access we thought would be down sequentially, so that makeshift goes the other way. And so it’s a series of things we’ve had focused on cost initiatives, so we’ll see some of those begin to benefit in the Q4. In Q4 we do think the product mix will shift a little bit the other way. So those two things together are the drive slightly higher gross margins.
Operator: Next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Victor W. Chiu: Hi guys this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I just wanted to go back to Europe really quickly for a second. Now on the last conference call you mentioned that you expected Europe to be relatively flattish, but it was actually a bit weaker. Is the weakness in Europe related to specific segment because it seems like video processing was a fair amount last quarter, but this quarter it was a bit weaker and the opportunity for Edge and Access?
Patrick Harshman: Well Victor in general our European business tends to be tilted more strongly towards the video processing products than the U.S., simply because cable represents a lower percentage of our business in Europe. In Europe, well in the U.S. cable is a, it’s really a big piece of the business. And in Europe cable is an important segment, but actually no bigger than IPTV business we do with telcos, the business we do with satellite direct to home operators and as well as the business we do with media companies. So a down business in Europe disproportionally impacts both our video processing products and our production and playout products, because that’s where we really have the exposure in both those products. So what play not Edge and Access and satellite in media companies, et cetera? So indeed video processing was down this quarter and you got it correct. It was basically in line with the fact that Europe is weaker, on an absolute basis and in fact on a relative basis because we anticipate it. And also we have and as I pointed out domestically, satellite and media orders were down as well. Those two things together, drove the video processing number overall down to floor.
Victor W. Chiu: Okay. And just very quickly on gross margin, can you give us an update on your cost reduction efforts, and may be some specifics around how that's reflected in your guidance and I think you mentioned that you're fine tuning some of the processes I think were particular markets, versus specific products. Instead of just flat cost, so you can mention how that is going to impact the results going forward?
Carolyn V. Aver: So we have a qualified dollars of gross margin publicly, but we have initiatives that our beginning to be impacted in Q4 and really will impact next year, probably more significantly till they take (inaudible) and your standard cost if you will. So we are seeing a little of that benefit in Q4, and will now to get more of that in the next year. On the products for market, I think you are referring to Patrick's comment last quarter we are trying to focus the right product at the right market and also look at our broad portfolio of products and make sure we have the right products in the right places. And certainly that effort continues and there’s something we do on an ongoing basis.
Operator: Next question is form Amitabh Passi. Please go ahead with your questions.
James F. Hillier: Thanks this is actually Jim Hillier for Amitabh. I guess not a follow-up question on the gross margin. Your Edge and Access business were both stronger in the quarter, and I did things typically lower margin, yet we did see a sequential improvement in the margin. So if you could talk about some of the puts and takes that would be helpful.
Carolyn V. Aver: So it’s an overall mix, because the other thing is that P&P was up this quarter, which is our highest margin. So I think there was some offset between the increase that we got from the production on playout products and the impacts on Edge and Access and those two things I think balanced each other out. Does that make sense?
James F. Hillier: Okay got it. And then may be another easy question with regard to the NSG core product and how you think that product can compete effectively or perhaps against some of the incumbent CMTS providers that are also pursuing the CCAP opportunity?
Patrick Harshman: There is no doubt that we’ll have competition, but as I mentioned earlier, we have been working closely with our customers from the beginning, got some fantastic core technology that we’re building this around, which is best QAM technology in the market. As far as I know, we are the only ones to announce actually QAM density technology that meets the CCAP spec where we have the luxury of starting from scratch in terms of a new platform. and so we build this NSG Pro that we have announced really from the ground up to support CCAP specifically. And frankly, we’ve hired some top tier talent that also has some deep DOCSIS high-speed cable data experience to the team. so with complement of the existing team of people who have been there and done that. So it’s a recombination of all of those things, it’s not a slam dunk nothing in this world is, but we feel as confident as I think we could at this point, that we have a product that that’s going to be extremely compatible. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we’ve already now deployed it with in customer lapse and your early returns on that testing has also been extremely positive, that’s bolstering our confidence as well as the confidence of our customers that this company and this product really has something to offer the specs.
James F. Hillier: Okay. Thanks, again.
Patrick Harshman: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Next question is from Greg Mesniaeff with Maxim Group. Please go ahead with your question.
Greg Mesniaeff: Yes, thank you. Patrick, can you go over what some of your assumptions are on edgeQAM pricing in a post-CCAP environment. I mean do you see pricing getting more robust or more competitive after your edgeQAM products assume a CCAP form factor?
Patrick Harshman: Well, I’m going to stay qualitative for obvious reasons, Greg. Individual QAM pricing will go down, but the volume is going to go through the roofs. I mean this is step-up, the whole thesis here, why this is being deployed, as the idea is to turn the entire cable award spectrum into QAM enabled spectrum over which IP traffic in particular IP video is traversing. That’s really a revolution in the infrastructure; it’s a revolution in the volume of QAMs that are out there. So the idea is, we see actually good win-win for the industry. We see the opportunity, industry to deliver, innovative IP based services and with this technology at a much lower cost than would be feasible with today’s DOCSIS technology. On the other hand, because the volume will be so grade and because of where the technology is progressing. we see an opportunity to realize not only substantial revenue gains, but also higher margin product that we’re investing a lot in this product; we’re delivering a lot of technology and value. and I think we’ll be appreciated by our customers. And so the price per QAM goes down, the volume goes up and we see a pretty attractive business opportunity.
Greg Mesniaeff: Gotcha, and just a quick follow-up. what kind of a substitution slope do you see for the CCAP form factor, edgeQAMs versus – in other words, are the current non-CCAP edgeQAMs, is there a long tail for them or is the tail rather steepen to hands off pretty quickly to the CCAP?
Patrick Harshman: Well, I think these transitions are always hard to forecast since one of the reasons we’ve adopted the strategy that we have. And what we’re going to be delivering to the market is a CCAP compatible chassis that holds just edgeQAMs to make sure. and with that, we expect to build footprint, and we expect that to be used the way edgeQAMs are today. But over time, when this is going to vary, I think from operator to operator and have some system to system, when they are prepared to move to CCAP infrastructure and where they’re with appeal hard in the platform, one that operationally they know how to use. So now, we’re hiring no fore clip upgrade et cetera, et cetera. I mean it’s a cliché and I clinched saying it, but as much as closest, it gets to in this space. This is a future going solution. And that’s really a big part of what our customers responding so positively too.
Greg Mesniaeff: And I assume that’s the same network management so for that all control family.
Patrick Harshman: Absolutely, it’s a unified platform and operating system for us. we’d call it Cable OS and it’s migrated from our QAM system and again, the early returns from the customers were taking close look at this very positive. So it’s common management software, and it’s part of the beauty of the solution.
Greg Mesniaeff: Gotcha, Patrick. thank you for that color.
Patrick Harshman: All right. Thanks, Greg.
Operator: We have a follow-up from James Kisner with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your follow-up.
James M. Kisner: Thanks. I just want to quickly ask about Ultra HD, I mean you mentioned a couple of times before, I recognized you haven’t set a timeline, but I’m curious where do you think that might be rolled out first, I guess geographically or by segment also it would be helpful, if you have any idea?
Patrick Harshman: Yes, I do. We talked about and have certainly been out there in the standards work companies in the camera space and some of the consumer electronic guys in TVs have been working on it, but what has changed materially from my perspective in the last three months, it has been the fact that several of our customers were starting to really take notice, and really think about how they differentiate themselves. And James, there isn’t a pattern. we have a cable customer, one geography who is extremely interested; another geography that I’d take the lead customers satellite direct-to-home operator. So there is not a – I think it’s down to the individual operator and kind of their vision of how they’re going to differentiate themselves. I’d say the common theme is in any market, it’s the operator who really wants to differentiate himself, is having the premier video technology, video viewing experience available. And increasingly, that’s a way that we see in different market verticals, different geographies, our customers are trying to differentiate themselves. So the televisions are coming and if you see one of these demos, it’s nothing short of stunning, I mean you put that together with the latest Dolby audio and I mean it just blows you away. I don’t think there’s any volume next year, but there may be initial things. but certainly I believe that we will start to see real volume in 2014.
James M. Kisner: Okay, that helps. Thanks a lot.
Patrick Harshman: Thank you.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to give the call to Mr. Harshman for closing comments.
Patrick Harshman: All right. I simple like to thank you all for participating today. I hope it comes across that we’re excited about our business. we’re undaunted by the challenges that we see macroeconomically, we’re very encouraged by the progress that we see in several geographies as well as the excitement we see from our customers around our newest technologies. So we’re extremely focused on executing for the short-term as well as for the long-term. And we very much appreciate you continue to follow Harmonic. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Carolyn V. Aver: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
