"Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Letasha [ph] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Harmonic fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Miss Carolyn Aver, Chief Financial Officer. Ma’am you may begin.
Carolyn Aver: Thank you so much. Good afternoon everyone. This is Carolyn Aver. With me at headquarters in San Jose, California is Patrice Harshman, our CEO. I’d like to point out that in addition to the audio portion of this call, we have also provided slides, which you can see by going to the Harmonicinc.com website and clicking on the fourth quarter earnings call button in the events section on the front page. Now turning to slide two, let me remind you that during this call, we will provide projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We must caution you that such statements are only current expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to documents that Harmonic files with the SEC including our most recent 10-K and 10-Q reports. These documents identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, the financial metrics we provide you on this call are determined on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. Revenues described as pro-forma include Omneon as if they had been part of our results for the period stated. These items, together with corresponding GAAP numbers and a reconciliation to GAAP are contained in today’s earnings press release, which we have posted on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. We will also discuss historical financial and other statistical information regarding our business and operations. Some of this information is included in the press release, and the remainder of the information will be available in the recorded version of this call on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Harshman: Thank you very much Carolyn, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Turning now to slide four, let me begin by saying we’re extremely pleased with the way our business is performing. We had record quarterly revenue of over $138 million with Omneon contributing about $31 million to the quarter. Excluding Omneon’s contribution, we still had record quarterly revenue of just over $107 million, up 24% year over year. We also had very strong bookings during the fourth quarter of $134.8 million, underscoring that we captured both market share and end of year spending among our growing global customer base. In addition to growing our revenue and bookings, we continue to improve our operating performance with gross margins of 51% and an operating margin of 13%, as we execute our long-term strategic plan and focus on higher margin products and profitable growth. Our non-GAAP earnings were $0.11 per share, up from $0.07 from the fourth quarter of 2009. Turning now to slide five, let’s look at the full year. And we can see that 2010 was really an excellent year. We delivered strong growth across the range of markets and geographies we address. Excluding Omneon’s contribution, our 2010 standalone revenue was up 21% year over year. We believe that our continued organic investments in R&D, sales and service, are really paying off for us. We also successfully completed the acquisition of Omneon during the year, which extends our leadership as the trusted and innovative video technology partner to global broadcast and media companies. For the full year, Omneon generated revenue of $122.2 million, up 16% year over year. Moving into 2011, our business integration of Omneon is nicely on track and our customers and sales channel partners around the globe continue to be very excited about the combination. Through both our organic execution and the addition of a strong and tough Omneon business, we’ve significantly expanded our industry leadership and market position. Our powerful portfolio of solutions now spans the production of high quality HD programming through the delivery of new mission critical internet and TV anywhere services, positioning Harmonic as the premier technology partner to the world’s media and communications companies. And just as importantly, to our substantially increased global sales and support presence, we’ve positioned our company as a strong business partner to a fast growing base of diverse global customers. I’ve spent some time in both Asia and Europe over the past month and I can tell you our international position has never been stronger. Moving now to slide six, let’s take a closer look at some of the specific business highlights that underlie our strengthening market position and expanding opportunities. We continue to have great success enabling all manner of new high definition services and applications, expanding reception, play out and coding, transcoding, encryption, edge processing and distribution of both life and on-demand HD content, and we continue to see success across the customer categories we address including broadcasters, cable operators, satellite operators, Telco’s and now video production houses. Our video processing product revenue, which includes our industry leading Electra encoders was up 25% year over year. Our spectrum play out server business continues to benefit from growing upgrades of broadcast facilities to support high definition as well as the addition of new HD channels. Recently announced international play out deals include SWR, a leading broadcaster in Germany, the NRJ Group in France and Arena Sport in Serbia, and it’s great to see HD starting to really take hold overseas. We also delivered a record number of EdgeQAM’s to the market in 2010 as growing HD on-demand content libraries drove more VOD consumption and consequently more and more EdgeQAM capacity. We also saw the continuing growth of live HD programming by several of our cable customers to invest in EdgeQAM’s for bandwidth savings, with digital applications. Our breaking new HectaQAM product is shipping in volume and is being very well received by the market. We see good opportunities to gain further EdgeQAM market share in 2011. More generally, across product categories, we have a very strong pipeline of new products and new licensable software functionality for already deployed products that will allow us to continue to benefit from the ongoing global transition to high definition. Our new media solutions for both service provider managed and over the top application are beginning to gain some serious momentum. We deliver record growth at video transcoding revenue in the quarter and for the year. Over the course of the year, we also won over 10 new multi-screen projects that collectively span live and on-demand applications delivered both over the top and over service provider managed networks. Following the recent CES show, it’s also clear that video capable tablets are now coming in force, and we’re quite encouraged by several tablet driven trials currently underway with key customers. Complementing our expanding portfolio of leading technologies, we’ve also been increasing our strategic focus on the support and professional services we can offer our customers. We’re very pleased with the 24% year over year revenue growth in this area, and you can expect us to continue to focus on expanding our support and service capabilities in business going forward. Turning now to slide 7, our strategy of expanding our global customer base also continues to bear fruit and drive growth. Our international business represented 54% to fourth quarter revenue and revenue in 2010 from emerging markets, which include Brazil and Latin America, Russia and former CIS countries, India and China grew approximately 40% year over year. We’re also very pleased to see that in 2010 we made over 50% year over year growth in bookings in our Telco/IPTV business. Enabling this growth was not only our powerful video processing products, but also our deep IPTV deployment experience and our growing sales presence addressing both domestic Telco’s and international markets. In particular, we had several wins with prominent emerging market Telco’s, securing strategically valuable new customer relationships. Beyond expanding our Telco customer base, we see our continuing leadership in IPTV as strategically significant for our business with cable operators. Worldwide we see cable operators increasingly focused on IPTV technology as an enabler of new mission critical, multi-screen services. I mentioned last quarter that we received our first major IPTV order from a US cable operator. I’m pleased to report that project is going well, and we’re now looking forward to growing opportunities to leverage our deep IPTV expertise and help our cable customer’s advance their strategic plans. Another key customer base expansion target is the video production space. Key to our success in this space is our exciting media grid optimized storage product, and we’re very pleased to see record media grid revenue in the fourth quarter. We have a very strong pipeline of new storage and associated media management product releases coming and leveraging these products to further expand our position in video production environments is a key strategic focus for us going forward. Turning now to slide eight, we’re moving into 2011 as the leading infrastructure company for video and uniquely positioned to capitalize on a very dynamic marketplace. You don’t have to look further than the recent CES show to see that there’s a fast moving new video economy that is being driven by consumer demand for more HD TV and multi-screen services. By growing reach and strength and content owners, we bring new business opportunities as well as intensifying competition among traditional and new video service providers. We believe our customers, the video service providers, global media companies and broadcasters, are prepared to invest in 2011 to continue to advance their strategic position in this fast moving video economy. And we think our customers are looking for both innovative technology and solutions and fast moving focused and capable business partners like us. Consequently, we see great opportunity for Harmonic to build on our strengths and recent success and help our customers do even more. Turning to slide nine, for 2011 we’ve adopted four strategic imperatives to take advantage of these opportunities and our strong market position. First, we intend to leverage our increased scale, solution breadth and competitive strength to expand our brand and deepen our customer relationships in both developed markets, while also continuing to work aggressively to capture greater market share in emerging economy markets. Second, we intend to extend our leadership position in new applications in new customer verticals; namely, multi-screen, new internet media services and video production. Third, our objective is to continue to lead the market in technology innovation and deliver on the exciting pipeline of new products and solutions we have scheduled for release over the course of the year. And finally, we intend to continue to enhance our operational execution. And on that note, I’ll now turn the call back over to you Carolyn, to talk more about our fourth quarter and year end results and our financial outlook.
Carolyn Aver: Thank you Patrick. Turning to slide 11, as Patrick highlighted, this was another strong quarter for Harmonic and a nice ending to a very good year. Driven by market demand for our products and the benefits of year end spending by some of our customers, net revenues grew 21% from the fourth quarter of 2009 on a pro forma basis, including $800,000 of Omneon deferred revenue that was carved out. Gross margin increased to 51% compared to 49% in the previous quarter and 48% for the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase is due to the inclusion of Omneon for the entire quarter. Excluding Omneon’s contribution, our gross margin remained relatively flat with the third quarter, reflecting a mix of higher margin products offset by an increase in charges for various inventory provisions. Operating expenses were $52.2 million, again reflecting the inclusion of Omneon for the full quarter. Our operating margin was 13%, up from 12% last quarter and 11% a year ago. During the fourth quarter, we integrated the Omneon operations organization and moved its manufacturing lines to Harmonic contract manufacturer in Malaysia. We integrated the G&A team and migrated the ERP process to our Oracle system. And, we physically moved the Omneon folks into our offices in San Jose and the UK. As a result of these activities, we recorded one time charges related to severance and excess facility costs. Our non-GAAP tax rate remained at 30% in the quarter. This is a result of an increase in our tax rate related to the Omneon business, which was offset by the effect of the extension of the R&D tax credit. Our GAAP tax rate was quite high this quarter due in part to the buy one of the Omneon IT by our international operations. Our reported non-GAAP net income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.11 per diluted share, up from $0.07 per diluted for the same period of 2009. Turning to slide 12, let’s look at our revenue and backlog in more detail. As noted, total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $138.2 million. On a pro forma basis, fourth quarter net revenue was up 21% compared to fourth quarter of 2009. 2010 pro forma revenue was up 20% over 2009 and Harmonic net revenue excluding Omneon was up 21% 2010 over 2009. Total bookings for the fourth quarter were approximately $134.8 million, again reflecting the strong demand and the benefit of some of the year end spending by our customers. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $121.9 million, down slightly from the third quarter and reflecting higher shipments in the quarter as well as higher bookings. Moving to slide 13, we have significantly diversified our revenue mix across different geographies, products and markets during 2010. International revenue made up 54% of net revenue in the fourth quarter, showing our continued strength worldwide, including emerging markets in China, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Our largest customer was again Comcast, representing 12% of our revenue in the fourth quarter and 17% for the year. Cable customers accounted for 47% of our revenue in the fourth quarter, satellite and Telco 21% and broadcast and media, 32%. Video processing revenue in the fourth quarter was 45% of our net revenue. Production and play out 20%, Edge access products 22% and service and support 13%. We have once again provided all four quarters of 2009 and 2010 in this revenue mix format for Harmonic, Omneon and both combined. Now that we’ve integrated our sales organization for 2011, we’ll be providing this information going forward only on a combined basis. As you can see on slide 14, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. We generated over $10 million in cash for the quarter, resulting in an ending cash balance of $120.4 million. Our inventory was $51.8 million effectively flat with the third quarter and inventory turns improved slightly to 4.7. Our receivables balance increased to $101.7 million, reflecting the growth in our quarterly revenues. Our DSO’s were 67 days, up from 64 days in the previous period. The increase is due to an increase in deferred revenue, reflecting shipments invoiced but not recognized as revenue in the period. Finally, or capital spending was $2.4 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to outlook on slide 15, the first quarter is typically sequentially down for Harmonic, particularly when we benefit from year end spending as we did in this recent fourth quarter. As a result, we expect net revenue for the first quarter of 2011 to be in a range of $129 million to $132 million. This excludes approximately $2 million of certain deferred revenue that would otherwise have been recognized by Omneon had the acquisition not occurred. Non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter of 2011 are anticipated to be in the range of 50% to 52%. This reflects our expectation of increased shipments of new products, which initially have a larger component of hardware and therefore, somewhat lower gross margin, as well as the impact of the Omneon deferred revenue carve out. Our target for non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter is $53 million to $54 million. Note that our headcount was 1,106 at the end of the fourth quarter, down slightly from the end of the previous quarter, reflecting the integration and restructuring that we executed during the quarter. We executed our international tax strategy on the Omneon IP in Q4. This strategy will result in a lower non-GAAP tax rate for 2011. We currently anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate for 2011 will be approximately 25%. As we look out into 2011 on slide 16, we see a number of encouraging signs. Our combined business has excellent momentum. We continue to expect over 12% revenue growth for the year. We also expect strong combined operating performance. With the relocation of Omneon manufacturing, we should gradually see an improvement in gross margins in the second half of the year. We anticipate the combined non-GAAP operating margins for the year to be in the 15% range with margins improving during the year. With that, I’ll turn the call back over the Patrick for some closing comments.
Patrick Harshman: Well thanks very much Carolyn. In summary, we believe that our growth and progress during the year significantly expanded Harmonic’s leadership position in enabling the video economy. Our success was driven by growing worldwide investment in video services, as well by our strong competitive position and expanding international sales presence. The acquisition of Omneon has further expanded the breadth of our solutions, our global broadcast and media customer base and our international presence. On a more personal note, I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the extraordinary support of our customers and business partners around the globe. I also want to acknowledge the tremendous effort Harmonic employees around the world have made to deliver these results. I believe our employees are the best in the industry and the talent, dedication and supporting our customers and commitment to our business is nothing short of remarkable. Moving into 2011, we expect broadcasters, media companies and video service providers around the globe to continue to invest in producing and delivering high value video programming and services. You can expect us to continue to introduce innovative new technologies that enable this dynamic video marketplace to proceed. We’re excited about our expanding opportunities for growth in 2011 and beyond. And with that, we’ll end the formal portion of the call and Carolyn and I would now be pleased to answer any questions that you have. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets.
Carolyn Aver: Hi Mark.
Mark Sue: Thank you. Maybe if we could just kind of think of your parameters for top line growth in 2011, how you’re seeing the upgrade with some of your traditional customers and how that’s providing visibility and whether or not the Omneon business might see some further acceleration in the back half of this year.
Patrick Harshman: Mark, could you repeat the first part of the question for us?
Mark Sue: Sure. In terms of the prospects for increasing your top line growth rate for this year versus last year and how you’re seeing the stability of your base customers in terms of upgrading your upgrade a lot of the encoding products and how we should see the Omneon business further accelerate.
Carolyn Aver: Sure. Let me just start with one point. You know, we’re thrilled that we grew 20% plus in more or less any way you cut the numbers last year. Our target is to grow 12% so our growth rate will decline. Obviously we’re still very pleased with the growth in front of us, but we don’t expect to grow 20% at this point this year. I think I’ll turn it over to Patrick to talk about how we feel about the encoding business, the HD wave visibility and maybe the impact of Omneon.
Patrick Harshman: Yeah Mark, we did see a good rebound off of what was a pretty dry 2009. The key thing is I think we took advantage of that to really gain some market share. You know we continue to push on the product front, deploying our sales force worldwide. We think we’re very well positioned. I don’t see the tremendous year over year change in capital spending that we saw from 2009 to ‘10, but we do think our customers are going to continue to spend really right across the board in almost every category that we address in cable, in satellite, in Telco, in broadcast and media. We see the television advertising business back in strength. That was a little bit slower to recover. And we’re pretty optimistic about our international business as well as our domestic business. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve just come back from a trip overseas and I see a lot of activity overseas. So we’re looking forward to really getting going on this year and we’re excited, but I think that at this time, we’ll stand pat on the growth forecast we’ve given.
Mark Sue: Lastly Patrick, just your thoughts on just cable, the moving dynamics there, if you see any change in planning for spending for this year. Any qualitative comments would be great on cable. Thank you.
Patrick Harshman: You know Mark, we stay very close to our large cable customers and we’ve not seen or heard anything that causes us to be surprised frankly. I think we’re still as we always are at this time of the year, waiting for final capital budgets to get resolved, but look, we think there’s a lot of bandwidth pressure in the networks, so whether it’s digital video, whether it’s greater compression, whether it’s more HFC, and now we see that as being a key theme, and we definitely think responding to the competitive pressures that are out there. I think we’re going to continue to see even more HD programming to be competitive with satellite and cable. We’ve seen a very heavy push behind on-demand and a lot of that content, if not all of that content moved to being HD. And then of course, we see the multi-screen opportunities. I think the I-pad and what it can do as both a navigation device and as a video reception and consumption device has certainly captured the imagination of a number of our cable customers, and the fact that we’re really well positioned and already running in that area, as we are in IDPT technology, which is going to be used to enable that, we think puts us in a great position.
Mark Sue: That’s helpful. Thank you. Good luck.
Patrick Harshman: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next question comes from Amir Razwadowski from Barclays Capital.
Amir Razwadowski: Thank you very much and good afternoon Patrick and Carolyn.
Patrick Harshman: Hi Amir.
Carolyn Aver: Hi Amir.
Amir Razwadowski: Carolyn, I was wondering, taking a look at your first quarter guidance if my math is correct, we’re looking at just over double digit operating margins and I was wondering if you could talk us through how you get to that mid-teens range on an operating margin basis for the full year. I mean are there still cost reduction efforts? Is it the gradual gross margin improvement, or what are the factors there that we should be considering?
Carolyn Aver: Yeah, I think it’s a combination of gross margin improvement and a managed investment of OpEx. And so we look at those two things a little bit hand in hand because we have a firm target on operating margin. So as we continue to expand gross margin, we’ll balance that between improving operating margin and taking advantage of the growth Patrick was just talking about. So it will come from both of those.
Amir Razwadowski: From an OpEx perspective do you think that this is sort of a base level that you folks will be stable at or is there some additional synergies there? Just trying to understand.
Carolyn Aver: No, I don’t think it’s going to come down from here on an OpEx level. I think it’s going to be stable, and frankly, could grow slightly over the course of the year as we, depending on how we see gross margin build.
Amir Razwadowski: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then Patrick, just on a bigger picture in terms of your revenue growth, certainly strong revenue growth rounding out the year and it seems as though there are a number of initiatives that you folks are benefiting from. I’m just trying to understand sort of the HD wave here. You had mentioned that internationally, there have been some opportunities and sort of, if you can give us a little bit more color in terms of the investment cycle that’s going on from that perspective. You feel we’re at the tail end of that in the US versus growth internationally or how we should understand the different wave of investments.
Patrick Harshman: You know from a global perspective, US and international all in, we still think we’re relatively (inaudible) Amir, although I have to say that we don’t see HD as a one-time event. Even wit in the US, you talk to customers, so US is by far and away the most mature market. Satellite operators from a national channel perspective, have deployed towards 200 channels. Cable operators still have a way to go to get there. But that’s in the live program. I mentioned for instance, we still see a big move of on-demand content. As we see more and more on-demand traffic, all that being HD, is going to ripple right through the network, having implications for the edge and the access of stream processing business etc. Overseas, it’s still relatively early days. We think the vast majority of Omneon’s installed base of broadcast service with broadcasters around the planet are still standard definition. There’s a massive upgrade cycle that needs to happen particularly overseas to move to HD. And then there’s the next generation of the formats. You know we’re still mostly at 720P, 1080I formats. There’s 1080P coming and if you talk to consumer electronics manufacturers at the CES show and elsewhere, you’ll hear about 2K and 4K formats that are coming. So you know, HD is a broad umbrella for a lot of different products and services offered by our customers and for us it’s a broad umbrella driving investments in really a broad range of our products and technologies. So we continue to see it as probably the single largest theme powering our business at least over the next couple of years, Amir.
Amir Razwadowski: Okay, great. Thank you very much for the color.
Patrick Harshman: Thank you.
Operator: And you next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Morgan Keegan.
Simon Leopold: Thank you. Got a couple of things. First I want to see if we could get a little bit of clarification around the customer segment definitions, the cable, satellite, broadcast media. I’m just sort of doing a comparison to the previous year and it looks like the Telco got split up a little bit. Could you give us a little bit of more detail on how you made the new definitions?
Carolyn Aver: Sure. If you have the chart where you see the two years comparison in the new model?
Simon Leopold: I think that was on the streaming webcast, so it’s gone by.
Carolyn Aver: It’s also attached to the press release.
Simon Leopold: Okay.
Carolyn Aver: So the last page of the press release with all the schedules have that as well. And so there you’ll have a buy quarter, two year view of everything with and without Omneon.
Simon Leopold: Great. I’ll have to go through it. But if there’s some sort of color behind how you redefined it.
Patrick Harshman: So let me give you more qualitatively Simon. I mean we called it Telco and other. So previously, before we got together with Omneon, we had cable, satellite and then Telco and everything else. And the biggest thing in other, was actually broadcast and media. So we’ve gone back to our numbers and we’ve taken apart what was the previous Telco category, and we’ve taken Telco, meaning business just with global telecom companies, and we’ve taken that out and we’ve kind of put that in our service provider business and then we’ve taken the media and the broadcast and we kind of put that together from a customer segment point of view with the Omneon business. So in other words, if a year ago we did business with Deutsche Telecom and NBC for example, that would be lumped together in Telco and other. In our categories going forward, the Deutsche Telecom business moves to the service provider together with Telco and satellite, and then the NBC business would go as part of our broadcast and media and other.
Simon Leopold: Okay. Yeah I guess it was just I did not appreciate just how much was coming out of broadcast previously. I think that was surprising. Just moving to my next question, there was particular strength this quarter in the video processing and you talked a little bit about the drivers and I think one of the other aspects is a product cycle around the Electra 1000, and I don’t know that you could quantify it, but I’d like to try to see if there is some way to think about how much of the strength is related to industry demand and how much is related to the availability of the Electra 1000 in upgrade.
Patrick Harshman: Reword the second part of the question, availability?
Simon Leopold: Well it seems like there would be two drivers to make that video processing business strong. One is just general proliferation of HD channels, but the other aspect which I assume is company specific is, you have a relatively new product out of the Electra 1000 and so that would stimulate demand as upgrades not necessarily driven by the HD content, but say higher density.
Patrick Harshman: Okay, well it’s hard to parse that apart. I mean both are in play, and really even more than that. I think with the Electra 1000, we really developed a platform that supports a variety and a growing number of features. I’ve said in my prepared remarks, and I mentioned new software functionality, and that’s certainly a big part of our push on new products and technologies to get more mileage out of this platform. You know interestingly, in the past year we sold almost as many standard definition encoders as we did high definition encoders. Now I don’t know if this is what you’re getting to with the back end of your question, but why is that? Well, we continue to significantly improve suppression of standard definition, so even if you’re not increasing standard definition channels, you’d like to conserve bandwidth and you’d like to compress those better. And to your point, we now in this platform we can do that not only with better video quality or less bandwidth consumption, but also with less space and power requirements, and that’s a huge operational benefit to being used in the same platform for operators both standard definition and high definition. So it’s a little bit of all of the above. It’s a little bit more HD raw content. We also saw our first wave though of HD upgrades. We’ve now improved video quality and bandwidth efficiency so much relative to the first HD channels that were put out there three years ago. The people are actually upgrading that product. We’re upgrading existing standard definition product, and along the way, we’re not only capturing Greenfield or new channel ads, we do think that we’ve gained pretty substantial market share as people make some of these upgrade decisions. We’re pretty pleased with our success rate at displacing competitors.
Simon Leopold: Right. That’s really what I was getting at and I’m sorry I didn’t ask it more succinctly with the market share gains. And just one last question I’d like to ask that’s maybe a little bit long term is your perspectives on your initiatives around the Cmap architecture, what it could mean for you in terms of maybe EdgeQAM products and how you think about the timing and opportunity there.
Patrick Harshman: So for anyone who’s listening who isn’t aware, there’s some ideas in the industry out there about next generation data as well as Quam architectures and there are several different ideas being bandied about how these might come together. And look, we see it as opportunity. We think we have a clear market leadership position in EdgeQAM technology. We’ve got a huge deployed base. We have tremendous customer good will and as you know, our EdgeQAM’s are deployed not only in video applications but also, although it’s the minority of instances, where EdgeQAM’s have been deployed in high speed data, it’s predominantly Harmonic EdgeQAM’s as well. So as these architectures evolve and as EdgeQAM’s or some kind of hybrid device architecture may come into existence, we think it creates expanded opportunity for our technology, our platforms to handle even more of the traffic on the network. I would also have to acknowledge that to some extent you could view any time a new architecture comes a disruption, so I would acknowledge also I suppose that there’s risk. But you know this company has a history of really being on top of these kind of developments and we look at these discussions where architectures are going as more of an opportunity than a risk. In terms of time frame, I don’t know. It’s hard to imagine anything happens within the next year but you know, two to three to four years may be the window. But I think it would be premature for me to speculate and perhaps our customers would be a better source of estimate for when they might move to some new architectures.
Simon Leopold: Just to clarify that timing question, are you doing any product development work at this point or it’s too early to even think about that?
Patrick Harshman: You know I’d like to leave it at the fact that we’re quite involved. This is a space we’re very interested in, and to the extent that there’s an opportunity, we plan to be all over it.
Simon Leopold: Thank you.
Patrick Harshman: Thank you Simon.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Blair King of Avondale Partners.
Blair King: Hi. Thanks for asking the question. I wanted to follow up on I think one of Amir’s questions first on the gross margin side if you don’t mind. It sounded like as a standalone company, gross margin in the fourth quarter would have been flat and the excess came from Omneon, but then looking into the first quarter, there’s some new product introduction that’s happening. I’m wondering if you can give us a feel for what the hit the gross margin might be as a result of that in the first quarter and then how you see the gross margins trending out after that throughout 2010.
Carolyn Aver: Sure. So effectively my gross – - hi, by the way. Effectively my gross margin guidance is sort of implied flattish, same range as Q4, and it depends on how much of the product we ship as whether it’s mid, high or low of that range, but roughly consider it somewhat flattish if you will with the range. And then I guess the other thing that I’m point out though is another dampening impact is that we have this deferred revenue carve out, which we thought we would take in Q4, but rolled into Q1, and that has a negative impact on gross margins of 100 basis points. So you can interpret it as my guidance actually went up 100 basis point but for this deferred revenue piece, which is a one-time event, which kind of says we’re moving up, but now I have this deferred carve out piece that’s keeping it down in Q1. And then where it sits in that range is really based on how much of this new product we ship. We actually, there could be a significant amount of it, which could have some impact. I think then modest increase over the year is what we’re targeting now.
Blair King: Okay. And then the follow up to that is on the OpEx side, which Amir touched on as well, but if you could give us some indication as to where the investment might be, I suppose its sales and marketing.
Carolyn Aver: Yeah.
Blair King: And if it is sales and marketing, what should we expect on the top line above and beyond what you communicated in terms of 12% top line growth if anything?
Carolyn Aver: Yeah, so I mean my guidance was 12% so that didn’t change. And as you know, you don’t hire sales resources today and have them affect this quarter. Yeah, I mean I think the two principal areas, certainly if you look at our objectives as Patrick laid them out for the year, we see opportunity in a number of markets across a number of segments and we’re leaning into that a little bit by investing in sales and marketing. Behind that will be R&D to continue the innovation up and we’re targeting at continuing to be efficient on the G&A side. Again, those are going to be balanced by the growth in gross margin because what we’re committed to is operating margin improvement and a 15% operating margin for the year, so we’re balancing those two and committed to the operating margin line.
Blair King: Okay. One last question if you don’t mind Patrick. On the IPTV deployment that you had with the cable operator, you mentioned that in your prepared remarks. I’m wondering if you could give a little bit more color around that and is that kind of a one off or can you talk to us about what that trend looks like in 2011?
Patrick Harshman: We don’t think it’s a one off. We think that stepping back from the enabling technology, we think a key strategic priority of cable operators is really to extend their business, their reach beyond the television set in the living room or in the bedroom, and that really means connecting to more IP connected, internet connected devices. Initially that’s within the home, tablets etc. and then that’s eventually outside of the home. IPTV technology lends itself much more to these kind of architectures and in fact, the initial deployment that I mentioned is not to replace the infrastructure delivering video television, but it’s actually in parallel with that to allow this cable operator to extend their reach to IP connected devices. So we think that’s a key trend for the industry and you can look at it as both offense and defense frankly, and really IPTV architecture is to support multi-screen, multi device services are really top of mind for all the CEO’s that I talk to. And as I mentioned, our deep experience, expertise, the products that we have that work natively in IP environments, video or IP all come together to put us in a great position we think to take advantage of this trend.
Blair King: That’s great. Congratulations on a great quarter. Thank you.
Patrick Harshman: Thanks very much Blair.
Carolyn Aver: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Harris from C.L. King.
Larry Harris: Yes thank you. If I could add my congratulations for the quarter. A couple of questions with respect to switch digital video, and I know you can’t, it’s difficult to talk about particular customers, but you know one vendor in the market said that they saw perhaps some challenges in the first quarter. I believe you indicated you saw an opportunity to grow share. What are you seeing among say the cable operators in North America relative to switch digital video over the next few quarters?
Patrick Harshman: There’s a couple of things Larry. First, let’s remember that switch digital video is merely a technology to save bandwidth and we’ve always said that different operators have different kind of approach to that. And we as a company, we offer a number of technologies to help manage bandwidth. EdgeQAM’s for switch to video is one way. Better compression of both standard definition, high definition video is another way. Putting more bandwidth into the access network with our new multi wave length transmission technology is yet a third way. So it’s always been our impression that it’s a little bit horses for courses, and we’re very close to all of our customers, and we haven’t really seen any significant change. The comment that I made that you referred to you is really on our ability to capture more EdgeQAM market share, and I also want to emphasize that while EdgeQAM certainly supports switch digital video, by far and away the number one application for EdgeQAM is around managing video on demand content. And here we just see a lot of growth opportunity. We see more on-demand consumption and it’s a key priority of cable operators to enrich their on-demand libraries and to make those libraries support high definition content, and we think all of that is going to drive a lot more Edge capacity and we think we’re very well positioned to take advantage of that.
Larry Harris: Great. And with respect to the software opportunity, the transcoding software opportunity, as more of these videos become available on I-pads and other tablets, I think you were previously talking around 5% of revenues in 2010 and perhaps growing to 10% or so in 2011. Are we still talking about the same sort of parameters or has the opportunity increased over the past few months?
Patrick Harshman: You know I think we still see probably multi-screen was about 5% of revenue roughly. We don’t break it out, but we’re very encouraged by the strategic wins that we had. A broad range of those technologies and our outlook on the growth has not changed. We see a significant to middle long term opportunity. Admittedly, many of the deployments we’re doing are still relatively small in scope. A lot of our customers are still experimenting with the business model, not only the technology. So Larry, we think we’re very positioned, but at this point we don’t have any really new meaningful update for you in terms of any financial modeling around that part of the business.
Carolyn Aver: No, I think that it’s probably indicative of the growth we saw. You know we talked about it more at the beginning of the year. We had more wins at the end of the year. Some of that is bookings. It’s not revenue, so the revenue of that rolls into next year. So I think the momentum we hear is evidenced in deals we see, but it’s still something that grows over time and with our revenue base is pretty big right now, so it takes a while for that to make up a meaningful part, but we’re starting to see the discussions convert into wins, convert into deployment, so I think we’re on the right path.
Larry Harris: All right. Well thank you.
Patrick Harshman: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies.
George Notter: Hi there guys. I wanted to ask about your experience in integrating Omneon. I heard the comments on the monologue but I guess I’m interested in your synergy target. I think coming into the deal you were looking at $8 million to $10 million synergy target for the full year 2011 and I’d like to get an update from Carolyn on what you think of that target and is that what’s implied in the 15% operating margin guidance? And then also, do you see any potential to generate more synergies than that original guidance. Thanks.
Carolyn Aver: Sure George. You know we think that the three things we executed on in Q4, moving manufacturing, moving, combining facilities and the reorganization in the back office, those three things together will deliver the $10 million of synergies over the course of the year. And that’s even partly what gets us to 13% margins in Q4 and will continue to drive both gross margin as well as operating margin going forward. So that’s a piece of the Omneon margins were mid-single digits and so when you add that on combined and you get the improvement that Harmonic was having, you get to 15%. We haven’t realized it all in our numbers yet, but we’ve made all the actions that will allow for those now to flow though our P&L. You know I think the second wave of integration and synergy is really sales and service and we kicked that off at the beginning of this year. We closed the year out really with the sales forces independent and we feel really good about how we ended the year, and then we started the New Year sales force kick off with the announcement that Mark Carrington would be our combined sales leader and really driving to a combined sales force. Now there, it’s less about saving OpEx dollars because as I think you can probably tell, we’re reasonably bullish on our market opportunity, but it’s around optimizing the resources we have to take advantage of the opportunity. And so there, the hope is that synergy is going to result in more cross selling, more combined revenue, better opportunity and ultimately higher growth rate on the sales side. That takes some time. You have to cross train people and everything, but that’s kind of phase two for us, and integration and that kicked off the second week of January.
George Notter: Okay, and then the potential for upside in synergies relative to that $8 million to $10 million number? Do you feel like there are other aspects? Could it be $12 million? Could it be $13, $14, $15 million? Any sense for it?
Carolyn Aver: You know I think again, I think that we’re focused on, sure there could be a few more million, but at the same time, we’re focused on investing in sales and service to drive revenue. So it’s more likely that’s going to get redeployed in sales to drive top line revenue.
George Notter: Great. Thank you very much.
Patrick Harshman: Thank you George.
Operator: And you next question comes from the line of Shubho Ghosh from UBS.
Shubho Ghosh: Yeah hi. This is Shubo for Nicos Theodopolis [ph]. Just wondering, could you give us some more color on Scopus revenues as a percentage of sales and how that’s been trending?
Patrick Harshman: You know we don’t break that out, but I would certainly point to our strength internationally, particularly in emerging markets. I commented in our prepared remarks that if you look at the brick and closely related countries last year, our year over year revenue growth was about 40% and attribute that a lot to actually the Scopus sales channels relationships and actually the sales leadership that came in. Additionally, although there’s been a lot of discussion in Q&A here on encoding and certainly that is the cornerstone of our video processing, the Scopus products, particularly contribution encoders and receivers are also an important part of the video processing product line and we’re pleased with the way those products are being accepted by the market, and certainly that is part of the overall strength that we have and it’s part of the scale that we’re taking advantage of in the video processing area. So we’re pretty pleased that we’re meeting our strategic objectives from the Scopus deal which is now nearly two years behind us.
Shubho Ghosh: Great. Thank you.
Patrick Harshman: Thank you.
Carolyn Aver: All right. Operator, we probably have time for one more question.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Richard Kramer from Arete.
Richard Kramer: Hi folks. A couple of quick questions. Patrick, a number of your larger competitors have been kind of on the sidelines for the past year whether it be Technicolor with its own issues, Motorola with the separation and a few others whether it’s the Cisco Erickson. They seem to have lost some focus in the area. Is this something that you expect will return in a fiercer competitive environment next year and is that somehow playing into your thoughts about sales growth? And also, another questions apropos the tablet comments you made before, are you currently seeing any material sales related to video delivery over mobile networks or is it still just a drop in the ocean relative to traditional video distribution or could that be another sort of a leg of growth for you. And then I have one quick question for Carolyn.
Patrick Harshman: So Richard first on the competitive landscape, we’re not counting on any material change. I will acknowledge truth in what you said. We do think that several of our customers have been somewhat distracted and challenged and – - competitors, excuse me. And we’ve taken advantage of that. But look we have some excellent competitors and we take nothing for granted and we certainly don’t assume that they stay de-focused forever. And I would tell you we think a lot of our success is really based on the excellence of our products and technology. So we’re very aware of our competitors. We take nothing for granted and our growth assumptions for the year do not envision any dramatic change in the competitive environment one way or the other. On the I-pad mobile question, you know it’s still modest, a little bit early. I offered the estimate previously. I think it’s still relatively true as we finished out the year that broadly in the kind of whole multi-screen media area. It was single digits, nominally 5% so it’s more than a drop in the ocean Richard, but we wouldn’t anticipate that it’s over 10% in this coming year. So we still look at it as mostly strategic ground work we’re laying for the years to come, but I also have to emphasize that our ability to offer those kind of solutions have a positive kind of halo effect back on the standard product. You know if someone is going to look at building a new video head for television sets today, certainly the fact that our technology, our products, our company knows how to support these multi-screen services, well that’s an added benefit if you’re making a standard definition or HD investment today. So I think it’s becoming an increasingly important part of the way we position ourselves strategically with our customers,
Richard Kramer: Okay. And one other question for Carolyn on the cash. Post Omneon, which is obviously a big move for Harmonic, could we rest easy that Harmonic will be a year in 2011 of large organic growth and can you say whether you have any thoughts by the end of 2011 that you might be looking at returning some cash to shareholders through some form.
Carolyn Aver: I think we certainly are looking at managing our balance sheet appropriately and thinking about our capital structure. We wouldn’t, if we were going to do it at the end of the year we probably wouldn’t talk about it now, but I think you should know that we think about those things regularly and at $120 million, I don’t feel like I’m swimming in cash yet, but it’s certainly something I’m mindful of.
Richard Kramer: And likewise, after Omneon, could we assume that not another big acquisition coming any time on the horizon?
Patrick Harshman: You know Richard, long term acquisitions are part of our strategy with the bulk of our growth being driven by organically, so I wouldn’t want to rule anything out. That being said, I will acknowledge and I will tell you that we feel like we have more capability, more tools in our hands with the combination of Harmonic products, Omneon products and the things we can do together than we’ve ever had before and certainly my focus is on taking advantage of all that we have currently at our disposal. We think we’ve got the right products, the right people in front of our customers, the right opportunity, and I and the management team are extremely focused on taking advantage of that in 2011.
Richard Kramer: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Patrick Harshman: All right. Thank you. And with that, we’ll wrap the call up. I want to thank you again all for joining us and I want to reiterate again our appreciation for the support you’ve given us over the past year. We’re genuinely excited about our business, the progress that we’ve made. We think we’re extremely well positioned in the market and we’re looking forward to a great 2011. We look forward to talking with you again. Thanks very much.
Carolyn Aver: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect."
