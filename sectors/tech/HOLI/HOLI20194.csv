Arden Xia: At this time, we'd like to open up for the Q&A session. Please note that for the Chinese-speaking participants, we can do the Q&A in Mandarin and we'll provide translation. [Foreign Language] Operator, please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have is from the line of Alex Chang. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: [Foreign Language] The first question is about the fourth quarter, the gross margin compared -- decrease and but we could see the IA or rail business, the revenues side are increasing. But relative to integrated contract, the compared decrease either.So how we can understand about the gross margin and definitely within contract gross margin. The second question is about goodwill impairment and which company impacted the goodwill impairment. Thank you.
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language] The first question about the gross margin. The integrated contract compared decrease, this is also including the influence by the international company spinoff. And -- but the main gross margin for the whole company just come from the railway transportation. A particular project, the gross margin is actually lower. So this leads to the costly fluctuation. But for the whole fiscal year, you see the gross margin still within a stable range.
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language] The second question about goodwill impairment, all come from the Concord company.
Unidentified Analyst: [Foreign Language] The second question is about the goodwill impairment. Right now, we do see still have US$37 million on hand, and could you help us to distinguish what kind of company inside of the goodwill.
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language] The US$37 million goodwill or - I mean that may come from the Bond company.
Unidentified Analyst: [Foreign Language]?
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language] And in the past years, the goodwill impairment all came from the Concord. And right now, each year, we do the testing for the goodwill impairment. But right now, the Bond is still, they are stable. And no such issue, but we will continue to do the taxing each year. Thank you, operator. The next one please,
Operator: The next question we have is from the line of Jacqueline Du from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jacqueline Du: [Foreign Language] The first question is about the service revenue compare increase very fast. But -- and also, about -- could you give us our a separate proportion for each business, IA, rail and M&E sector. And what about the service proportion for each segment.And the second question about the industrial automation, the coal fire is slowing down but we do see the new energy CapEx, power is increasing. But I still want to know about the IA total revenue breaking down for each industry proportion.And the third one is about the railway transportation, from the calendar year, to see the rolling stock, still no any problems right now. And what about how weak is that for the whole calendar year about the -- procurement of the rolling stock related to ATP contracts?
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language] Okay. The first question about the service. We do not disclose the breakout number for each segment. But the whole after sale revenue, including service right now, around the 20% of total revenue. This is compared increasing over time. And one thing I want to make a -- clarify is about this fiscal year, we started to use the ASC 606 and this is well influenced the service contract recognized revenue method, and we changed to use the POC this time. So this also compares a little affecting the service revenue recognition.And that is to say it should be higher than the current number. But because of the ASC 606 we can ask for based on the whole period of the contract. And the second one is called the IA proportion, and currently the petrochemical and chemical takes around 40% to 45% of total IA revenue and the power take 40% to 45% and the others about 10% to 15%, and the 5% from the nuclear power.[Foreign Language] And for the railway transportation new contract, for this calendar year, we get from -- mainly from the online -- equipment and from the track side and also the service contracts. But the ATP-related rolling stock, we have no any information right now. And most probably by the CRC, they will do the procurement at end of the calendar year, so we can see the future. Operator?
Operator: The next question we have is from the line of Alex Chang from Citi. Your line is open.
Alex Chang: [Foreign Language] The question is about the subway information. We did not hear more about the subway sector update. So is there any changing for the strategic planning or what else?
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language] The subway business deal is steady as before. So we have no any strategic changing for this part. Alex, do you have more questions? Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Sorry, please go ahead.
Arden Xia: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got the chance to raise your questions, we will be pleased to answer them from the follow-up comments. We're looking forward - okay, hold on a second, maybe we still have a question, right, operator?
Operator: The next question we have is from the line of Kevin Luo from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kevin Luo: [Foreign Language] The first question is about the fiscal year 2020 from the management perspective to say what about the new product -- what kind of new product we could provide the market and what about the influence about a new product to contribute to the revenue?And the second question about the railway transportation. Could you please distinguish about the backlog and what kind of proportion for the ATP and the maintenance and TCC?
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language] For the new product, we concentrate say the -- for strengthening our intellectual smarts and also our [indiscernible] investment, and this including the management diagnosis and also including the prediction for equipment including the hardware and software. And the simple like the -- industrial automation sector, we are implementing the project for the [indiscernible], the power plant. This is intellectual smart plant. And when it's finished, it could set a good representation for the customers.And also the railway transportation sector, the subway, we also used the intellectual information management. This is all come from what we dedicated the software, hardware platform. And these products, no matter the IA or rail, currently not take very large proportion of the revenue, but it will bring a very strong impact in the future.[Foreign Language] And beyond that, we also built - already constructed a team for the industrial information security, and we will provide new products in future. And also in the future, this part also gather revenue from the service and products.[Foreign Language] The railway transportation backlog, we have no breakdown number to provide, but I can give you some sense about the ATP contract, relatively compare a large percentage than the TCC on the rail track. And also the subway and the maintenance contracts still are normal. Thank you. Due to the time constraint we will now take one last question from the queue. Operator, please.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Joseph Qi [ph] from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: [Foreign Language] The first question is about -- for the fiscal year 2020, do you have any guidance for the top line and bottom line. The second question about the IA, what are the expectations for the future proportion changing?
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language] The first question about the guidance. Currently, we still have no guidance. But for the coming 2020 fiscal year, we have confidence to keep the growth. And if in future, we think that the situation getting material, we will give the update for the guidance.And the second question about the proportion. The proportion in recent years have no -- very stable, have no fluctuation, changing. But we will focus from another attack to say, we'll focus the energy saving, environmental protection and also the intellectual smart industrial automation work. So this part, we believe in future will bring strong momentum.
Arden Xia: Thank you, Joseph. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got the chance to raise your questions, we'll be pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We're looking forward to speaking with you again in the near future. Thank you.
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
