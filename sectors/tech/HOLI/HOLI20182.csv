Baiqing Shao: Thank you, Arden, and greetings to everyone. I would like to discuss some key events during this quarter. Industrial automation remained on the track of recovery with revenue recording at 25.9% year-on-year growth. At $57.6 million management teams had adhered to the low-to-high end market expansion strategy in industries such as chemical and petro-chemical, etc. while building comprehensive service capacity to address the substantial aftersales potential from the entire customer base and seeking new opportunities from existing end-users. On the chemical industry, we signed a contract with Jinan Taixing Fine Chemicals Company to provide system for their polyphosphazene project, a contract with Jiangsu Jingshen Salt & Chemical Industry Corporation Limited to provide Manufacturing Execution System for information integration of their salt packaging and distribution center. On the petro-chemical industry, we signed a contract with China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation to provide DCS and instruments for their liquid chemical wharf project. We entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with CEET, a wholly-owned subsidiary of China National Offshore Oil Corporation to collectively push forward the localization of core equipment on offshore oil platform. In the new energy and food-beverage area, we signed a contract to provide system for Chia Tai Group's recycling of waste project and a contract with Lihua Starch Corporation Limited for their sorbitol project. Our demonstration-for-further-application strategy in factory automation has brought us more market recognition. We earned government level recognition as we were listed as one of the 23 intelligent manufacturing system solution providers recommended by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. We continued to focus on several key industries and cooperate with famous players. On white-goods, our cooperation with Haier went further as we signed contracts on their Tianjin-based and Qingdao-based washing machine factories. On food beverage area, we are dedicated to provide innovative solution to address safety and efficiency issues. Upon the successful delivery of the first project, our relationship with Hai Di Lao went deeper, with regular communication mechanism set. We expect broader cooperation with them and more clients in the future. The performance of high speed rail was prominent in this quarter, with revenue recording a 199.0% year-over-year growth at $69.6 million. One of the contributors is the significant increase in aftersales order, including ATP maintenance and replacement contracts. Signing 80 sets of automatic train protection the ATP to high speed trains in 300 to 350 kilometer per hour also contributed greatly to the revenue because of the tightening delivery schedule to secure the Spring Festival Travel. Breakthrough has been made in our new product as we signed our first tract circuit contract for Chengdu-Ya'an regular speed railway line. In subway, we signed SCADA contract for Chengdu Subway Line 5. We will adhere to the expansion strategy to win SCADA contracts in more cities and work closer with subway authorities to promote our SCADA system and subway signaling technologies in future. Management team will adhere to the diversity strategy to create revenue stream from more new products and services, and to maintain a stable and healthy growth into the future. In oversea business, we signed several EPC contracts with domestic companies, including a contract with Shandong Ludian Corporation Limited to provide DCS for 2X350 Megawatt power station in Indonesia. Mechanical and electrical installation services recorded at 0.4% revenue growth at $30.2 million. We continued to address operation, management and risk control issue to ensure that projects can be delivered in good quality, while closely following economic and political circumstances in South East Asia and Middle East. Concord and Bond remained active in seeking business opportunities and we believe that their strategic value as customer resources and international sales channels remains significant. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Arden Xia, who will read us the financial result analysis on behalf of CFO, Ms. Herriet Qu?

Operator: [Operator Instructions] we'll go first to Sky Hong with Deutsche Bank.
Sky Hong: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: The first question is about the factory automation, is there any progress within recent months for the factory automation we also seen from the government side, we answer the first and right person. Within our standard to establish new standard for the industry focus on the intelligent.
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: We focus on the straight demand to do the factory automation. The first is focus on the cooperate with the large area or industry or cooperate with the companies like Haier or Hai Di Lao. We signed the contract to do the project and they expect us to [indiscernible] with the final results. So we find the further the larger contract than before. And this by the recognition of different vertical and also recognition by the potential customers. The second one is for focus on the inter-intelligence area because we all meet the same situation the factory automation the traditional industry wants to upgrade so to focus on the digital and intelligence is the next step and beyond the cooperate with the customers focused on the products. We also have to raise a solution to focus on the whole area and that's why we provide a way put this is also including our own products, new products and new technology to support the potential end markets. And the third one is to enlarge our broadening within the whole industry within China especially to participate some activities. Especially like to raise the standards of the Central Government. We earned at the government level recognition as listed one of the 23 intelligent manufacturing system solution provider recommended by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. So these activities what we're doing for the factory automation and we hope it will bring to you the new product and new technology in the coming months. Thank you.
Sky Hong: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Alex Chang with Citi.
Alex Chang: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: Okay, the first question have included a managed sub-verticals. The first one is for the - can we provide the percentage for the high-speed rail and subway the proportion for this quarter. And the second vertical is for the aftersales replica for the service contract that we could see our large increase. And this part was recognized revenue is booking into the aftersales for booking into the integrated contract revenue. And the third one is the proportion of aftersales revenue for the high-speed rail, right now.
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: The first question for the proportion of the high-speed rail and the subway revenue. The proportion will disclosed at end of this fiscal year. Currently we have no data at hand. But it's probably like more than 80% from the high-speed rail revenue at hand. And the second is about recognition of the service contract within the high-speed rail. We will incorporate [ph] into the other sale revenue not integrate that revenue. And the third one, the aftersales proportion for the high-speed rail we not disclosed number, we just provided total aftersales revenue right now currently by total around more than 15%. But from another factor, the high-speed rail, after sale revenue is increasing very fast original single-digit of high-speed rail revenue to right now two digits.
Alex Chang: [Foreign Language]
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: The question is for the replacement is for what kind of level of the repairmen's find [ph] or what kind other name. And the answer is, if not very directly equal to the five level repairmen's actually right now a lot of repairmen's from the level four and the replacement is not named at the level five.
Alex Chang: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: The first question is, 80 unused on the ATP contracts and how many recognized by the end of December 1. And also the second question is about ASP trends for these contracts. And the third question is about D2 [ph] area 300-350 kilometer power segment. What about the future trend for the procurement?
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Alex Chang: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: [Foreign Language] I cracked at the first question is now for recognized how many trains. Actually the question is for 80 sets or unused contracts that is contract or run by the first half year of 2017 or the second half year 2017. The after second half of 2017 especially within the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The second question about ASP trend, the ASP note and exchange compared before because in this area, we all provide the signaling system, so the CRC not gives any free of cost pressure within the price. And the third one for the 350 kilometer train complement. It still have to wait from the information of CRC after train [indiscernible] currently we can just know from the CRC like until Transit 18 there will be 900 trains unused for the 200 still need to wait for the information. Thank you Alex.
Alex Chang: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: The first question is now for the trend because we can see the second quarter of the industrial automation new contract just flat. So what about the trend for the coming next two quarters. And the second question is focused on the, if not disclose the breaking down industry that revenue of IA [ph], can you give us sense of which special industry report were generated that the revenue increase?
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: We combine these two questions together to answer. The industrial automation revenue made from the industry from power and chemical, petro-chemical and the power including the co-fire [ph], thermal and new energy and this area is increasing and the trend for the whole fiscal year we will keep the compared increased. Within the quarter maybe have fluctuated, but the whole trend is positive and we believe at the end of fiscal year we still can keep more than two digits growth, either from the revenue and the new contracts. Thank you Alex.
Alex Chang: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Jacqueline Du with Goldman Sachs.
Jacqueline Du: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: The question for the procurement, one the AT trains for ATP, what about the delivery? It's all focused on the [indiscernible]. [Foreign Language]
Jacqueline Du: [Foreign Language]
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: [Foreign Language]
Jacqueline Du: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: Okay the answer for the AT train after complement ATP were one, partially we deliver for the strength factual not to all for strength factual need and also the second question for ask doubted new procurement type line for recent demands. Is it well within the third quarter or after March? It's hard to say the type line because it's our dominated by CRC. The only customer, so we really have to wait for their information. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Patrick Xu with Nomura.
Patrick Xu: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: The first question is high-speed rail factor recently delay - accident for the [indiscernible] within the Chengdu-Ya'an line and can you describe some information this accident? And the second one is for, we granted by the industry intellectual program by Central Government is any subsidiary or any award by from this grant?
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: Okay and the first related accident actually it is just a single equipment problem within the train, is not too much a fact by the complement line. Everything right now just to go in place, so it's not a very large lead to any bad results. It's just an equipment fault, so not to relate signal-controlled products. And the second is for the 23 intelligent manufacturing system solution provider recommended by Ministry of Central Government. We will benefit from the - like we can carry on the large Central Government program and also we can - we have same recognition by the industry can easily to expansion or transformation business.
Patrick Xu: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: Because the time restraint, so the one last question.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Thomas [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley.
Unidentified Analyst: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: The first question is about here I want to clarify two things, the 80 sets means the 80 sets of ATP, it was 40 trains not 80 trains. The second one and back to the question. The first question is doubt 80 sets of the ATP contract is all from the 300, so we do not see 200 area of procurement and especially the replacement equipment. If all come from the 300, is that means there had no replacement for the 200? [Foreign Language]
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: And also the question is focused on the 80 sets, ATP's all for the new generation of 300, is there any old ones? The answer is yes, all come from the new of the 300, no old ones and also the replacement we have but not within this 80 sets. Actually it's also booking to the aftersales revenue. Right now not too much replacement and maybe the cycle will start to from several years later. Yes this is the first question and the second question is about the R&D distribution. Right now we also focus on the factory automation development and also the high-speed rail, we have the new product like track circuit [ph] so how you allocated resource within R&D and balance the advantage. [Foreign Language]
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Unidentified Analyst: [Foreign Language]
Baiqing Shao: [Foreign Language]
Unidentified Analyst: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: Actually the R&D expenditure from the numbers to see, it will have a little bit increase but not too much, this is as before I mean 6% to 8% of total revenues. But we want to emphasize from the R&D itself will focus on the over lacking pack of the shared the platform like and also we emphasize the platform not a single product. The platform is for the solutions, but when we do the R&D in the near and over lacking part, for example if electronic company want to use part of SCADA it also can use the - to share with the rail factor and also IA [ph] can also do the SCADA, so they can share the SCADA by the rail and IA [ph]. So we emphasize the efficiency of the R&D to - after this like the overlapping part can reduce the R&D expenditure. And also we want to say I want to explain more about what we'll do within the R&D right now. Beyond the rail factor like the factory automation we emphasize on two things. The first one is mechanical ability. This is focused on like the machine product like we'll meet the project like Hai Di Lao after the [indiscernible] side they need to us provide a machine replaced labor, so we have to raise ability to provide the machine. This emphasized mechanical ability and also the Hollycon from the Chinese [indiscernible] area they also focus on the machine mechanical ability rate. But the second path is for the software for the technology based on solutions. This kind of solution focused on the layer of data close to equipment. For example like the proximity computing or like the data analyzing or data install rate of the cloud. Those kind of things focused on the traditional industry upgrading, intelligence upgrading. So this area we have to provide a lot of new technology or new method combine with our existing products into a platform to assume that solutions focused on different verticals, so that's the transformation we actually have a lot of things to do and we are working on it. Thanks, Thomas.
Unidentified Analyst: [Foreign Language]
Arden Xia: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got the chance to raise your questions. We will be pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We looking forward to speaking with you again in near future. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude our conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."
