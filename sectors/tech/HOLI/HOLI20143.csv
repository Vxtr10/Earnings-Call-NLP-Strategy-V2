Baiqing Shao: Thank you, Jennifer and good evening everyone. We are very pleased to report a solid financial and operational result for the third quarter of this fiscal year. Here I would like to discuss some key events during this quarter. During this quarter, we continuously insisted on executing our strategies to vertically penetrate in the high-end industrial automation market while improving our market share in mid to low-end markets. We achieved several high-end projects wins in chemical, thermal and enlarged our market share in food beverage and new energy industries. We were also focusing on building strong after-sale department and set long-term goals on improving after-sale services. Our solution in reducing waste material emission and environment protection proved to be successful. The past few months have been very exciting for Hollysys. A series of strict testing and on-site engineering application indicates that our new generation K-series DCS products meet the requirements for large and complicated projects including power and chemical, etc. Our products will significantly improve our market competitive advantages and effectiveness of project as well as improve our client recognition. For the past few months, our HOLLiAS-N DCS product has been successfully operating in the Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant, proving that our quality assurance system and products are completely qualified for the high standard of nuclear usage. When China accelerates its nuclear power plants construction in the future, we believe we will benefit more financially as well as in reputation in the long run. Going forward, we believe that we will increase our overall market share in the industrial automation, nurture and quickly take commanding height in our new businesses leveraging our advanced technologies, experienced professionals, profound industry expertise and customization and innovation capability. In railway transportation, during this quarter we feel excited about the significant high-speed rail ATP contract wins for high-speed trains in 200-250 km per hour and 300-350 km per hour, total valued at RMB687 million. Besides, our strong R&D capability, extraordinary project management and high-quality and reliable products had ensured our wins on a few recently operated high-speed rail lines, including Xiamen-Shenzhen line, Xi'an-Baoji line, Chongqing-Lichuan line and Wuhan-Xianning line. Those high-speed rail lines are all equipped with our high-speed rail signaling system. We will continue to deliver quality works and work closely with railway authorities in the future. With China's increasing rail construction and equipment procurement budget for this year and exciting prospect envisioned, Hollysys, as a well-recognized rail signaling system provider with strong R&D capability, solid execution and reliable products, will continue to penetrate China's vast railway construction market and achieve significant results. For the overseas industrial automation and rail transportation expansion, we are sending qualified and experienced engineers from China to overseas, and recruiting local engineers to expand our overseas team. With our proprietary technology and products, industry expertise and strong competitive advantages, together with our expanded local channels through Bond and Concord, we will continue to make exciting achievements in the international market in both industrial and rail transportation fields and creating value for our shareholders. With this, I'd like to turn the call over to Jennifer Zhang who will read the financial results analysis on behalf of CFO Ms. Herriet Qu. Jennifer.
