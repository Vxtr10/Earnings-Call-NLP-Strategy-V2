Arden Xia: Thank you, Steven. At this time, we would like to open up for Q&A session. Please note that for Chinese speaking participants, we can also do the Q&A in Mandarin and we'll provide translation. Operator, please.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lingxin Kong from CICC. Please ask your question.
Lingxin Kong: The first question is focused on the gross margin for fiscal year 2018. And we could see the integrated contract gross margin from 28% raised to 33% and beyond the raise is that to the mix of the different projects. What these and other reasons for this matter. And also we could see the railway transportation compare IA the gross margin higher. But last fiscal year for example the railway transportation revenue goes down, but steel from that point to now, we could see the IA compare increase a lot, but still the mix, the gross margin maintain a high basement like this fiscal year 38.2%. So just to give us a hint about the gross margin. Second one, question is about the guidance, there has no guidance for the fiscal year 2019 and could you give us a little bit more landscape about future? Thank you.
Arden Xia: The first question about the gross margin, in this fiscal year still making high basement Beyond the mix reasons, we also have the other two reasons. The first one is railway transportation compare the percentage of total revenue contribution still high and this caused the gross margin higher than the other business. And also, this fiscal year the M&E business, also the gross margin improved - a little bit improvement. So, that's why the whole gross margin still maintained a good level. And the second question about guidance, the first thing we can see there from technical - technically to predict one year a little bit hard for the current circumstances. For example, like the external environment, the policy, the other things. And the second one is internally element because our current management team is thinking about the long-term strategy and sometimes for achieve long-term strategy or target would not compensate on the short-term of the numbers. So, that's the reason. Thank you.
Lingxin Kong: The question is about the high-speed rail revenue, the percentage of this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year increased, but could you provide the data about that product?
Arden Xia: And the answer is, currently I have no data on hand, but you can calculate by the financial result. Thank you. Operator, next one.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Varun [indiscernible] from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the call. So, my question is, we have recently seen CRC coming up with a blue sky plan. So, I wanted to get a sense from you, what impact do you expect to see on Hollysys from that particular plan in terms of train procurement going forward? And how does that impact the new order contracts for your company? And also, if you can - if it's possible to provide some guidance on new orders in second half of this year, like second half calendar year 2018, what is your thoughts on that? Can we see increased procurement coming in and that getting translated into higher growth in new orders? That would two.
Arden Xia: Okay, thank you. Right now the China Railway Corporation is entered a reform of the structure and also operating things. And that's why the bidding process be influence by this fact. And also if you see the 2018 calendar year, actual should be getting the contract, but a lot of bidding postponed to the second half of the calendar year. And that's why we think the second half year would performance better from the order than the first half. For example, like the HB [ph] contract and we will sign a contract before September 30th. And also at end of the year, no matter from the 200 or 300, the 300 still have some orders and the 200 is under research and development of new models. But at the end of this current year will be finished, but rather or not is for open the bidding for at the end of fiscal year or at the beginning next calendar year is hard to make a prediction. So concluding, I mean, it's hard to prediction of the bidding process, but we believe the current information that CRC want to enlarge the investment to CNY 800 billion and for this calendar year. So that's why we are positive for the orders, but the timeline would be fluctuate. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Chong from Haipong Capital [ph]. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. The first question about the industrial automation, from last fiscal year to right now, the new contract that is increasing very fast, so what about the future momentum. It's can we time [ph] this momentum. And the second question about the business trade conflicts between United States and China, along these go further is there any influence from your customer side or how much it could be influenced and from which effects. The third question is about the gross margin, you said that M&E have big step improvement about gross margin is it sustainable and why? Thank you.
Arden Xia: The first question is about the industrial automation. And this kind of increase because we internally strengthened our management skill and also we focus on target more about the high-end of the market. And also this including the recent intellectual projects emphasized by the Central Government and to all enterprises. And through the improvement of management skills and capability, we believe we can maintain the momentum. And the second question about the conflict - business conflict between China and the United States, the influence really have, but more positive to us. For example, raised the tax, the import tax about the DCS and PLC products from outside. And this that build momentum for us to penetrate the market. And also the Central Government emphasize on the procurement the local company, domestic company should emphasize on the house made IP and proprietary technology. That's why no matter from the procurement basic technology or products we are all made by our house. So this is also good for us. The third question about the gross margin, the M&E. The last fiscal year the concord [ph] some product raised costs. So lead to the whole gross margin down. And through our internal improvement and we strengthened control about the project. And this fiscal year why the M&E recover to a normal about 10% gross margin, and this is sustainable. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: The first question is about the - adding about the second - the trading conflicts, raised the import tax is that are for Hollysys, but the customer side do you see any slowing down because from customer side they are more cautiously to do like enlarge the production, like raise the spend, like all those things. So maybe shows that slowing down by customer. And the second question is about the industrial automation fourth quarter gross margin.
Arden Xia: The first question about our customer side, we are doing the engineering project, actually these projects were funded several years ago and that's why right now the complete influence not transferred to that right now. So we see - you have to see the future reset maybe the second half of the calendar year or next calendar year we can see the influence. This is kind of delay about the - our business. And the second question. The IA gross margin fourth quarter still maintain a good level, so no any sharply influence. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.
Arden Xia: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got a chance to raise your question, we will be pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We look forward to speaking with you again in near future. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude the conference the today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect."
