Baiqing Shao: Thank you, Arden. And greetings to everyone. I would like to discuss some of the events during this quarter. During this quarter, industrial automation business has been affected by weak external environment, with particular impacts on process control sector that we have not seen the recovery sign from the market. However, despite of the challenging conditions, our strategy of developing aftersales and services is proving successful which continuously take larger percentage of our revenue. Besides, giving the new construction projects in the near future would be lack of sustainable, we have already focused on reconstruction or upgrading opportunities as supplement through signed maintenance and service contracts to lock potential customers, helping them to improve efficiency and saving the costs. Breaking down in the industries, power is maintaining stable. We have taken several numbers of high-level generator units and signed large contracts such as Jiujiang Shenhua 2-gigawatt power units which was the highest level units in coal-fired power industry, while petrochemical is still weak, the same as metallurgy and building materials. Overall speaking, we have to say that external environment brings large impact for our industrial automation business, but we will adjust ourselves through better internal management and control such as to insist keeping gross margin for long-term health development within industrial automation to better cope with this situation and try our best to gradually recover the business. In high-speed railway, we signed a large contract to provide Automatic Train Protection equipment and system to China Railways Corporation. We are quite confident of the steady high-speed rail revenue and backlog performance. As China is continuously investing a certain scale on supporting high-speed railway sector for the next five years, we will still benefit from the policy of 13th five-year-plan. Furthermore, we are also working to expand our rail new products and technologies such as track circuit which would make potential revenue contribution in the near future. For subway business, we have signed quite a few SCADA contracts in the recent quarters and seeking opportunities to work with more local transportation bureaus. We will continue to deliver quality works and work closely with subway authorities in the future to build up our SCADA and subway signaling businesses both in China and abroad. In the mechanical and electrical solution segment, seasonal lumpiness affected the sector's performance in the short term. However, we are unshakable to penetrate the Southeast Asia and Middle East markets and make progress on delayed projects. We also actively communicate with the local customers to discuss new project opportunities and even seek business partners for business cooperation. At last, for extending international business, we have recruited local engineers to support our overseas team. With our proprietary technologies and products, industrial expertise and customer resources, we will continue to make exciting development and achievements in both industrial and rail transportation fields, and creating value for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Arden Xia who will lea the financial results analysis on behalf of our CFO Ms. Herriet Qu. Arden?

At this time we'd like to open up for Q&A session. Please note that the Chinese-speaking participants, we can do Q&A in Mandarin and we will provide translation. [Chinese language spoken] Operator, please.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Alex Chang from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Alex Chang: [Chinese language spoken]
Unidentified Company Representative: Hello.
Baiqing Shao: Hi, Alan
Alex Chang: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: The first two questions from Alex. First, about the ATP orders last time and we saw the price goes down, what about this order to affect the gross margin? And also, what about the future gross margin for the high-speed rail segment? The second question is about the G&A expense. And this quarter we found $2.1 million reduced, so, compared last year, compared last year the same quarter. And what about in the future, about G&A expense in rail segment and also industrial segment, which part will affect the [inaudible] goes down?
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About the first question, answer is ATP [inaudible] order, the price goes down. And we -- but we also have very special procurement and cost control internally. So for the order itself, the gross margin is going down. But for long term and the whole segment of high-speed rail, the gross margin we think will maintain between 40% to 50%. And also inside of this percentage, I said, it will go down a little bit, but still in this level.
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Alex Chang: Xie-xie.
Arden Xia: And the second question answer is about the better provision we focused on -- comes mainly from IA, industrial automation. And this quarter goes down because several quarters before, our management team internally controlled the contract, so we reviewed our customers' performance to control this part. That's why we have already take enough better provision. In the future it will -- still goes down from our perspective.
Alex Chang: [Chinese language spoken]
Herriet Qu: Xie-xie.
Unidentified Company Representative: Xie-xie, Alex.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jacqueline Du from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jacqueline Du: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: The first question is about the industrial automation backlog and the revenue and also new order goes down, and what about the trend in the future? And also please mention about -- talk about the contract size and even gross margin, something in the project of Jiujiang Shenhua 1 gigawatt power station project. Second question is about Concord and Bond. MIE, mechanical, electrical installation services, their business, what about the cost structure? Which part, spare parts for example, or components, comes from abroad, and which part produce by themselves?
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Baiqing Shao: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About the industrial automation, the revenue backlog and also new order is going down. But I want to mention, in the backlog, this is just including the integrated contract. Not already excluding the service render and the aftersales spare parts sales, so, along with our aftersales revenue goes up, like service rendered, you could see, and also spare parts is growing, so in future we will try our best to increase our industrial automation business. And also about the Jiujiang Shenhua project, it's 1 gigawatt power station. And the contract signed generally speaking is we cannot disclose in here, but just let you know, within the industrial automation, most of our contracts are constructed by the small size and we have a lot of number of projects.
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Jacqueline Du: [Chinese language spoken]
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Jacqueline Du: [Chinese language spoken]
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: Actually Jacqueline is concerned about the exchange rate will affect MIE part or even the whole business of HollySys. And CFO answered that exchange rate, it will affect -- it will affect very little in our business. Actually we are -- we have local account money -- I mean, for the local settlement, for the business, and this is not a factor on our P&L. But because a lot of components or business already did it [ph] in local area, and also we, right now, our business, based on a lot of localization providers, suppliers, and -- but the exchange rate will affect the translation. For example, we have a whole asset translation in the balance sheet. So this is will affect. But each company will meet the same situation.
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Jacqueline Du: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: Xie-xie, Jacqueline.
Operator: Our next question comes from Boyong Liu from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Boyong Liu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: The first question is about the industrial automation. The industrial automation gross margin is going down, so, what about the future trend? Second question is about C3, the 300 kilometers per hour ATP. The price of that [ph] order is going down, so it reflect -- when is it going to reflect to the net income? And why, because this order -- the price was goes down very large, so why you could also control the high-speed rail gross margin between 40% to 50%? And the last question is down to the second quarter railway revenue, goes up very quickly. So, which main reasons, I mean which part of products contribution to this sector?
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: For industrial automation, gross margin goes down. It has a lot of factors for the changes. And in future, it will continue goes down a little bit. But why compare this year and last year, because last year, the gross margin, they're high, because internally the nuclear power contract we have actual [ph] from CNNC [ph], that that project affected the overall gross margin for industrial automation. But we don't think in the future we will continue to get the contract from that side. So, generally speaking, it's really based on the project internal of the industrial automation structure. But the trend, it will go down a little bit, but still maintain 35% to 40% from we announced at first time.
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About the reflection, that contract to the net income, based on the percentage of completion of our project, and along with its finished project, we will continually to make the recognition of the revenue. And some part of -- already entranced to this quarter, and some part will go to the next fiscal year.
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: And about last question, I want to emphasize here, the 40% to 50% is the overall high-speed rail signaling part gross margin. If based on the single order of last time, the gross margin is lower than that. But from our structure of internal control of the cost and procurement, we still have confidence to achieve 40% to 50% generally for the high-speed rail whole segment.
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Boyong Liu: [Chinese language spoken]
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About the question, is the SCADA gross margin is very low compared to high-speed rail, so what about the overall for railway transportation segment? The answer is about because the high-speed rail revenue right now still takes a very large percentage of the whole rail transportation segment, so we still could control very well with the sector gross margin.
Boyong Liu: [Chinese language spoken]
Herriet Qu: Xie-xie.
Arden Xia: And due to the time constraint, we will now take one last question from the queue.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from Peter Halesworth from Heng Ren Investments. Please go ahead.
Peter Halesworth: Thank you. This is for Mr. Shao. I want to address an important issue for HollySys and shareholders, and that's the rising pile of cash on the balance sheet, and ask for a regular dividend to be paid to shareholders. Our analysis at Heng Ren, which we'll share with management and shareholders, shows HollySys could easily pay shareholders a minimum $50 million annual dividend now and through fiscal year 2019. And HollySys would comfortably be able to cover its CapEx and debt service as well. The $250 million net cash pile doesn't really need to grow anymore. HollySys' valuation needs to grow. And we believe it's a great opportunity now to do just that. If HollySys made a commitment to a regular dividend, we believe it would win many more shareholders and a valuation premium which we believe HollySys deserves. And with Chinese stocks being so volatile, a predictable growing stream of income from HollySys for shareholders would stand out and we believe be rewarded with a premium valuation, instead of the stock trading in single digits in terms of P/E. Also, embarking on M&A with the cash at such a low valuation would be counterproductive. So my question for CEO Shao is, would you pledge tonight to implement a regular dividend to increase greater value for all shareholders? And I also would be curious to know what other shareholders think of this proposal, which we'll share shortly. Thank you.
Arden Xia: Thank you, Peter. [Chinese language spoken]
Baiqing Shao: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: Thank you, Peter, for the question. Generally speaking, because the macroeconomic slowing down and a lot of uncertainty, so we still want to hold the cash relatively in a large base because in Chinese word we have, if winter come, we need more clothes [ph]. So that's why we hold a lot of cash on hand. And also we are a very small company in such environment. But for the dividend you're suggesting, we will consider it very seriously. Actually last fiscal year we already paid a dividend, but that's just one time. In future, we are in the discussions right now for the management team and we will consider your suggestion very seriously. Thank you.
Arden Xia: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got the chance to raise your questions, we will be pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We look forward to speaking with you again in the near future. Thank you.
Herriet Qu: Thank you.
Baiqing Shao: Xie-xie. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect."
