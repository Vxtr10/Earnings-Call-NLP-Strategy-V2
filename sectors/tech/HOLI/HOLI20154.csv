Baiqing Shao: Thank you, Arden, and greetings for everyone. In fiscal year 2015, we achieved solid financial and operational results amidst weaker general economic environment [inaudible] achievements and new contractor [inaudible]. Here I would like to discuss some key events during this quarter. In fiscal year 2015, we made solid achievements and delivered robust growth in several areas in terms of financial performance and business operation, and achieved higher than our expected net income guidance. When we enjoy the exciting moment, we also calmly evaluate the future opportunities and challenges and carefully plan for the future growth. Here we would like to discuss the achievements in the past fiscal year and strategies in the future in the respective segments. In the industrial automation sector, during the past fiscal year, China was continuously adjusting its industry structure and reducing the capacity in some industries such as metallurgy, building material, paper mill and coal fire power, but we gained more market share from rising industries to make up the loss from decreasing industries and through winning more high-end projects such as Guangdong Yuedian Bohe Thermal Power Plant, Guohua Shouguang Coal Fire Power Plant, Datang Sanmenxia Coal Fire Generating Units and et cetera, to remain in good shape for our total industrial automation sector. In order to better cope with weak general environment, firstly, we have been continuously improving our industry solution capability and competition capability to strengthen industry marketing and influence on the base of regional network construction few years ago, and focus more on larger projects with more total solution supply. Secondly, we increased the higher gross margin products providing including Distributed Control System, Safety Instrumentation System and advanced control software, to improve operation quality and profitability. Thirdly, we continued to provide quality service and maintenance to our customers, to set up long term working relationship with old customers and provide more value adding technologies to improve their operation. Fourthly, capture the new growth opportunities of energy conservation and emission reduction, and pursue the new business opportunities driven by intelligent and automated production and working. The factory automation which is categorized in the industrial automation is relatively a new business but with strong potential, in this area we provide proprietary Programmable Logic Controller and develop our proprietary solution and equipment, to the industries such as coal mining, waste water treatment, and the Traditional Chinese Medicine which performed well in the past fiscal year and we expect solid growth in the coming year. We have built up the advanced technology platform, mature products and successful application track record in the above areas, and we'd like to seek more opportunities to replace labor and improve production efficiency for our customers. Besides, we are expecting another strong growth driver of industrial automation from overseas market, we have established subsidiary companies and offices in India, Malaysia and Singapore few years ago to provide our industrial automation products. We are currently enhancing the localization such as recruiting local talents and establishing local partnership, we believe that we will have the same strong advantages as in China like the quality products, better service and better value for money which will enable us to win more customers and enlarge overseas business scale. In high-speed rail sector, we were continuously making remarkable achievements in fiscal year 2015. In this year, we signed several sizable ground-based high-speed rail signaling system contracts to provide the Train Control Centers and other related products consecutively, including the Foshan-Zhaoqing intercity high-speed rail line which is the first TCC contract with Automatic Train Operation technology applied, Jinhua-Wenzhou high speed rail line, and Xi'an-Chengdu high-speed rail line Xi'an-Jiangyou section; and two batches of significant Automatic Train Protection equipment providing contracts value at RMB580 million and RMB118.7 million, respectively. The strong backlog and booming order pipeline make certain for another strong year ahead. We believe with our key position in China's high-speed rail signaling system providing, superior products performance and well-reputed track record, we are well prepared to take more market share in the high-speed rail signaling in the near future. Besides that, our new product, track circuit is making significant progress, we expect to win first contract in fiscal year 2016 and becoming growth driver in the long run. In subway sector, we signed the contract of Tianjin Subway Line 5, Shenzhen Subway Line 11 and Lanzhou Subway Line 1 to provide Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System. In the future, we will closely work with local subway authorities to explore the SCADA and subway signaling business opportunities both in China and abroad. For overseas business, we were satisfied with Bond and Concord' capability of winning orders and execution, and we are expecting strong business growth from the overseas sector. In the next phase, we will continuously accelerate the overseas business expansion, ensure the healthy development of their business, increasing our proprietary products and systems providing leveraging their market resources, and improve our overseas business gross margin. In addition, analysts and investors are invited to attend our Annual Investor Day around mid-October, which will be filled with showcasing our whole executive team, insightful presentations from various corporate executives and facility tour, to further enhance our transparency, corporate investor relations and communication. Our shareholders who would like to participate in this annual event shall contact their brokerage firms or contact us directly to arrange the reservation; we are looking forward to meet with you in October at our premises. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Aidan Xia [ph] who will read the financial results analysis on behalf of CFO, Ms. Herriet Qu.

Arden Xia: Thank you, Alex. The first question is, please introduce the gross margin of fiscal year 2015 and the percentage of of 2016 fiscal year. The second question is about [inaudible] depreciation. And we have $20 million convertible loans, so, how to deal with the money? And what about the exchange rate loss, for example, like 1% decrease?

And the Industrial Automation, this quarter, especially the nuclear power station revenue, will take a relatively high [inaudible] revenues. So the gross margins [inaudible] higher. But in the future [inaudible] 2016 fiscal year, their gross margin will slow down a little bit. But we'll keep the high gross margin in the future. About Rail sector, the gross margin is around 50% and the spare parts sales is around [inaudible]. In future, maybe the next year, the subway revenue will gain more, so it will drag down the [inaudible] gross margin [inaudible] in the year. M&E, the gross margin is 50% and then it will increase in the future. Thank you.
Harriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About convertible bonds, this will transfer to the stocks. And we're right now not considering to change the U.S. dollar to have the exchange rate [inaudible]. And in the future we will consider some financial tools like keep the rate in some specific dates just like that.
Harriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About goodwill impairment, actually it is $1.9 million. And the increase is from the balance sheet, they have some differences, that's because of the Singapore dollars translate. So, generally speaking [inaudible] provision still on $1.9 million.
Alex Chang: Xie-xie.
Harriet Qu: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jacqueline Du from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.
Jacqueline Du: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: Thank you, Jacqueline. The question is about the backlog [inaudible] automation in the [inaudible] in the backlog? And what about compared to the year by year and what is the difference or changes of the backlog? And what about the future, I mean 2016 fiscal year backlog change?
Harriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken] Relatively the factory automation in [inaudible] the IA, just takes a small portion of IA revenue. Most of [inaudible] like 97% are [inaudible] to BCS [ph].
Baiqing Shao: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: In the -- from the future perspective of the backlog, we will continue providing the -- enhance our input of the resource to whole Industrial Automation market and to provide our solution ability. And also we will penetrate the high end of the market, for example, like the thermal power this year, we get a lot of projects. And about automation, the factory automation, we will continue to transfer our products to solution provider. So we will try our best to achieve the future like the factory automation take more of our industry automation revenue. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Xu from Nomura. Please go ahead.
Patrick Xu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: Thank you, Patrick. The first question is about track circuit. For fiscal year 2016, what do you think taxation [ph] of this product? And what about the turnover days and also what about the market share and then the whole [ph] market scale of this product, and also the gross margin about this product? And second question is about the income tax, that it seems like increasing this year. What about future?
Baiqing Shao: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: Okay, thank you. The track circuit that we have already got the permission from CRC last year, at end of last year. And we gradually make progress, for example, like we [inaudible] examination of [inaudible]. After that, this year we are participating another second experiment and passed the testing trial operation. So, about the new order will emerge in the next year. And the whole project period will -- for each project for track circuit, it may be one to one-and-a-half year. And about the market scale, it is also very large as the high-speed rail and also it can use in the lower-speed market. So the potential market is very huge. Thank you.
Harriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About the gross margin of track circuit, we have not integrated [ph] yet into our revenue, in the next year, and right now we have no data so it is hard to give you a specific gross margin for that analysis. But it belongs to the high -- to the rail market, so the gross margin is relatively high as the other signaling products. So we will see in future.
Harriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About income tax, you could see why it increased, because it contains the withholding tax expenses were accrued for the potential profit distribution from PRC to overseas. So if deducted this part, the income tax rate would be around 17% and relatively it's a normal situation. Thank you.
Patrick Xu: [Chinese language spoken]
Harriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: The question is about, is it possible that we'll do the provision of the reported [ph] tax in future, each year in future? The answer is, if we need it, we will do that. Thank you. Due to the constraint, so we will now take one last question from the queue. Operator, thank you.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Frank Xu from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Frank Xu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: Hi, Frank.
Frank Xu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: The question is -- the first question is about new products. Beyond the track circuit, what about the subway CBTC system? And what about the factory automation new products? The second question is about [inaudible] rate loss. It seems like $6.7 million. What's exactly inside of that? And the third question is about the Industrial Automation. We said that the integrated contract gross margin is 40% and the service rendered is about 65% and the spare parts sales is about 78%, is that right?
Baiqing Shao: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About new products, CBTC subway, we have already -- do have the national, international standards that [inaudible] and also finished the experimental design and testing. So we get the award from the industrial experts' evaluation. And they recognize our product and will help us to do some expand [ph] to introduce our product into the markets. We have some cooperation. And another thing is the -- you could see our subway revenue is [inaudible] because we have already recovery of our subway business. So that also will help us set up good relationship in the local partners to push our CBTC system. And about factory automation, we have already put a lot of resources in this area. For example, like TCM, Traditional Chinese Medicine dispensing machine and [inaudible] machine, right now is about third generation and we have already implied [ph] into more than 1,000 hospitals. So in future we will accelerate this part and also put more resources in the factory automation to help development.
Harriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: The second question [inaudible] about exchange loss, around $6.8 million. It's because of the Singapore exchange rate with U.S. dollars.
Harriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Frank Xu: [Chinese language spoken]
Harriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: And the number is right, but I want to emphasize that this is the 2015 fiscal year gross margin. For our perspective in future, it's not -- it may not reach this level. So we want to give you a [inaudible] number that maybe could decline -- relatively decline a little bit. Thank you.
Frank Xu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: I noticed that the fourth quarter of 2015 fiscal year, the Industrial Automation revenue is about $46 million. It's relatively declined year to year about 30%. So, what about in future, if this will keep this number and also maintain high gross margin situation?
Baiqing Shao: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: About Industrial Automation, yes, there is some gap between -- beyond our expectation. And that's because, the first, micro-environment [inaudible] also we already set up some strategy [inaudible] like the control, our insight of management control, and we already implied SAP ERP systems. And we will control contracts strictly, to choose the good contracts, and actively give up the weak contracts. About the future investment, we will continue to invest into the [inaudible] like pharmaceutical and the environmental protection, this area, and we will cooperate with local institutes and also we will hire more [inaudible] in different industries. So in a word, we will keep the growth rate as [inaudible]. Thank you.
Frank Xu: [Chinese language spoken]
Arden Xia: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. If you haven't got a chance to raise your questions, we will be pleased to answer them through follow-up contacts. We're looking forward to speaking with you again in near future. Thank you.
