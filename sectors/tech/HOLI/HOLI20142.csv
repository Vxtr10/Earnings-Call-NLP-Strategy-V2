At this time we'd like to open up for the Q&A session. Please note that for Chinese-speaking participants, we can also do the Q&A in Mandarin and we will provide translation. [Chinese language spoken] Operator please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chapman Deng from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.
Chapman Deng: Okay, thank you. Thank you, management. Congratulations on a set of very strong results. I've got three questions. First, for the -- I noticed that you revised your FY14 revenue and net profit guidance. But can you actually walk us through the revenue growth guidance segment by segment in FY14? And at the same time, can you also provide your guidance for FY15 as well? That's the first question. The second question is on the Industrial Automation segment. I noticed that the new order growth in the past quarter has been very, very strong. May I know the reason why? And can you tell us a little bit more about which sub-segmented drive the revenue growth? That's the second question. And my last question is on the overseas operation. I also noticed that new order from overseas was very strong on Q-on-Q basis. May I know the reason why? Thank you.

Chapman Deng: [Chinese language spoken]
Baiqing Shao: [Chinese language spoken]
Chapman Deng: Xie-xie, Shao.
Baiqing Shao: Xie-xie.
Jennifer Zhang: Okay, thank you. I will provide translation briefly regarding the revenue and net income guidance revise up. It's mainly from several aspects. The first one is because of the Bond acquisition from the overseas segment. And secondly, definitely the most important, is because of the high-speed rail revenue growth. It's more than our original expectations. And thirdly is because of the strong growth from Industrial Automation. So overall speaking, in the first half of 2014, it will continue to deliver very strong growth, so that's why we revised up our guidance. As for the 2015 guidance, we think we will continue with the sustainable and strong growth. For the specific figures, we will talk and announce later. And the second question about the Industrial Automation new order growth, the reason is -- the industries. Firstly, because of the thermal power as well as in the petrochemical industries. Last quarter the revenue achieved more than 20% growth. So briefly, in the thermal power industry we'll continue to improve our market share, and also there is very large existing reconstruction opportunities in the thermal power industry. And second, in the petrochemical and chemical industries, our market share is still very low, so there is a lot of space to penetrate. And thirdly, it is because of the after-sales revenue, we will continue to enlarge our after-sales network and strengthen our work in this field. So as a percentage from the after-sales revenue will continue to improve. And the last question about the overseas growth, it's mainly because of the Bond acquisition. So that is a strong growth driver to sustain our overseas growth.
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Chapman Deng: [Chinese language spoken]
Jennifer Zhang: Okay. Ms. Qu added that the major reason for the guidance revise up is mainly because of the high-speed rail strong growth, because originally we were expecting about 30% of revenue growth from high-speed rail, but actually we may deliver over 70% growth. As for the other reasons, from the IA and Bond, we have already considered in the original period when we are adjusting our guidance. So the major reason is mainly to talk about high-speed rail. Thanks. Next question please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alex Chang from Citigroup. Please ask your question.
Alex Chang: [Chinese language spoken]
Baiqing Shao: [Chinese language spoken]
Alex Chang: [Chinese language spoken]
Baiqing Shao: [Chinese language spoken]
Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Alex Chang: Xie-xie.
Jennifer Zhang: Okay. For the first question regarding the percent of increase of net income revise up is a little bit higher compared with the revenue growth revise up. The major reason is because of the high-speed rail ATP orders because this is a high gross margin business. So that's why the percentage of increase of the net income is higher for the whole year guidance. For the second question regarding the new orders in the first half of this calendar year, I'm sorry we cannot give you a specific time, as well as the market share we believe that after the CRC [ph] established, which should create a better competition environment, so we can sustain our growth -- our market share. For the third question regarding the overseas acquisition targets, we are evaluating and searching some targets, but there's no specific targets to be fixed and enough [ph]. So we will announce when it is settled. Thanks. Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Yang [ph] from Impex [ph]. Please ask your question.

Herriet Qu: [Chinese language spoken]
Jennifer Zhang: Okay. The first question is about the Big Four was considered [ph] by the SEC. Briefly, our auditor is E&Y. We have made continuous communication with E&Y. Currently we are not affected by this affair. And we believe that it will take some time to take the effect of this suit [ph]. So we'll continue to focus on the progress and believe this affair will be solved in the future. So we have a very optimistic view for this issue. And secondly, regarding about the Hong Kong listing, so the management will consider a proper time and chance for evaluating to be listed in Hong Kong. But it will be mainly depend on the market opportunities and our internal demand. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
