"Operator: Hello and welcome to Inseego Corp.'s First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. Please note, that today's event is being recorded. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity for analysts to ask questions.  On the call today are Dan Mondor, Chairman and CEO; Bob Barbieri, Interim Chief Financial Officer; Ashish Sharma, President of IoT and Mobile Solutions; and other members of the management team. During this call, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, which is available on the Investors section of the company's website. An audio replay of this call will be also archived there.
Dan Mondor: Thank you, and hello, everyone. It's great to be with you today. Let me begin by saying that today this company is better positioned than it ever has been on almost every possible measure. As I look back at our progress over the last few years, Inseego is a very different company in a much stronger position. This is illustrated in our first quarter results compared to last year. We reported a 120% increase in our combined 5G and software as a service revenue over last year and gross margins over 35% up over 400 basis points. We ended the first quarter with approximately 60 million in cash on our balance sheet and zero bank debt. There are four predominant reasons for our remarkable transformation. First, we have greatly reduced our customer concentration by expanding our 4G and 5G carrier customer base in the U.S. and increasingly in international markets. Second, a rapidly growing software business is yielding recurring higher margin revenue on top of device revenue, which contributed to our strong gross margins this quarter. Third, carrier customers are embracing our recently launched 5G fixed wireless access products and we see fixed wireless access as a major growth driver for the company going forward. Fourth, our first enterprise 5G fixed wireless products were launched and sold this quarter in North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. As we enter 2021, we have just announced the biggest win in company history with the launch of our 5G Wi-Fi hotspot at T-Mobile, which has quickly become our highest volume 5G customer. T-Mobile has also adopted our Inseego managed software platform, which adds recurring subscription revenue to those hotspots sales. We are making solid progress in international markets with some initial 5G customer deployments with more to come. We continue with testing, regulatory approvals and customer contracts in multiple regions. While it's taking a little longer to establish business in new regions, we see international markets as an important growth driver.
Ashish Sharma: Thank you, Dan. Over the past year, our customers have relied on our innovation to accelerate broadband adoption through our state-of-the-art 4G, 5G and cloud solutions, while protecting the end users from security threats. From my numerous conversations with customers, it is clear that our 5G technology, along with our cloud innovations will form a powerful engine for their business transformation growth as their technology needs continue to evolve at a rapid pace. From a product revenue perspective, we saw strength in our 5G mobile broadband portfolio and Inseego managed cloud portfolio, which now accounts for 20% and 24% of our overall business respectively. This combined 44% is at 2x from a year ago. The mobile broadband business continues to build up and we are experiencing great reception of our M2000 and M2100 5G solutions from all customers. Consistent feedback we are receiving from our carrier customers is that our technology is far superior to any other similarly categorized product in the market. We secured another 5G operator Sunrise in Switzerland, the commercial launch plan for early June. We also just launched the MiFi 8000 in Canada with Rogers and Fido. Many new carrier customers in international markets are trialing our 5G solutions and we anticipate new launches in the coming months. Moving to 5G , we just released a series of new Wavemaker products focused in both carrier and enterprise markets, including two indoor Activewear products, FG2000 and FX2000 and a rugged outdoor product the FW2000. These products are certified for use in many different regions globally and have recently been certified for use on the T-mobile network. This is a major accomplishment for Inseego. Our focus now is on implementing joint go-to-market strategies to maximize our success in this very early market.
Bob Barbieri: Thanks, Ashish. First off, let me say how happy I am to be here on the call with you today. Given today is my one month anniversary and I've not had the opportunity to speak with many of you. Let me start off the call by introducing myself and offering why I was attracted to join Inseego. I have over 25 years of experience as a Senior Executive, including being the Chief Financial Officer at growth software, cloud and technology companies and specifically public companies such as Apogee Enterprises, Lawson Software and TriZetto. I was brought on by the Board of Inseego as Interim Chief Financial Officer with a mandate to support the company's transition to a high growth 5G and SaaS company. I would like to now review the results of our first quarter of fiscal 2021. Q1 revenue was $57.6 million, up about 1.5% from Q1 of 2020. We should recall Q1 2020 benefited from the onset of the COVID demand surge, which began in the final weeks of the quarter. The favorable year-over-year comparison is largely due to growth in 5G and software revenue as Dan and Ashish highlighted. The sequential decline results from a lower level of the surge demand for 4G hotspots, albeit they are running at higher levels than the pre-pandemic activity. First quarter IoT in mobile solutions revenue was 43 million up 1.3% year-over-year and down 40% from 72.1 million in Q4. Inseego subscriptions were up 11.5% sequentially, and up 175.7% year-over-year, which helped drive the growth versus the prior year. Sell through of 5G hotspots continues to be strong and we expect an increase in new shipments in coming quarters as units ordered harmonized with the ongoing demand. Enterprise SaaS revenue for Q1 was $14.6 million, up 4.8% quarter-over-quarter and relatively flat over the prior year. The sequential increase reflects both better sales as we recover from lockdowns in South Africa and the continued strengthening of the Rand versus the U.S. dollar. With respect to the sale of Ctrack South Africa, the transaction continues to progress according to schedule. And we'll continue to anticipate closing the sale at the end of the quarter, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. This will lead to approximately an additional $36 million to our cash balance based on the current exchange rate.
Dan Mondor: Thanks, Bob. We're delighted to have you on the Inseego team. I want to close by expressing my sincere thanks to our dedicated employees who continue to do an amazing job in these challenging times. They are the driving force behind our numerous accomplishments and I can't thank them enough. We've made significant investments over the past two years to create a best in class 5G and software solution portfolio and in sales and marketing resources to capture significant market opportunities. These investments have begun to be reflected in our results. The strength of our portfolio has helped us succeed in initial customer engagements across multiple regions in the developing fixed wireless access market with carriers and enterprises. We have excellent customer relationships and are seeing tremendous traction with our industry leading 5G products and new software as a service solutions. This gives us more confidence than ever in our ability to become a high growth, high margin, 5G and SaaS global solutions company generating strong free cash flow. With a strong second half, you can only imagine what 2022 will look like. Thanks again, everyone.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  First question comes from John Marchetti with Stifel.
John Marchetti: Dan, if I could just a couple of quick questions on the overall business trends in the enterprise. You mentioned some of the initial sales that you saw here in Q1. How do we think about that as we start to move through the year contributing to that second half strength? I mean, obviously, big focus on 5G products, obviously with mobile hotspots and things of that nature. But how do we think about the enterprise opportunity? Is that more a '22 event, or do you think it's a real contributor to that that second half growth outlook you just highlighted?
Dan Mondor: Hi, John, great question. Great question. Well, as you know, we've just recently launched our enterprise 5G portfolio. So it is any traction in the market, terrific that T-Mobile for business certified three of our products, indoor and outdoor fixed wireless products. We're starting to work with them on market opportunities, and then broadly through our distribution channel that that we described in North America and APAC. So we see it beginning to contribute in the second half, it will be a ramp as usual. But we have the portfolio, we have the software solutions to go with it and the distribution in our target market. So it's a ramp for the second half as we see it and certainly carry a great momentum is what we're expecting to see going into '22.
John Marchetti: And again, just as a follow up to that is, is there a better margin profile with those enterprise products relative to maybe the mobile hotspot products? And obviously, the software pieces are very different margin profile, but how do those solutions stack up? I guess margin wise, relative even to the 5g mobile hotspots?
Dan Mondor: Yes. As we all well know, the enterprise market in general has a different gross margin profile there is the benefits of the distribution, but I will say this, yes, it is higher than if you will, the kind of the carrier gross margin profile as far as this fixed wireless access products. I would expect somewhere in the mid 40s.
John Marchetti: And then, maybe just the last question for me, and I'll jump back in the queue. From a software perspective, obviously, a lot of you mentioned some of the carriers that are now offering alongside but as you go-to-market in that enterprise market as well, is there a different attach rate there for software? Is it higher or is it lower? Just curious, how that stacks up relative to what you're seeing on maybe some of the mobile hotspot side as well. Thank you.
Dan Mondor: Yes, a great question in addition, John, thank you for that. Well, we're seeing strong attach rates across the board. As you know and as we announced T-Mobile is adopted our Inseego managed solution as part of the their initial 5G hotspot deployment, AT&T is now adopting Inseego Connect to offer to their enterprise customers as part of their, the launch of our new the new 4G hotspot business with them. All of the conversations with enterprise and all for the right reasons that they want to look at how they can deploy how you acquire, how you manage and how you secure their enterprise. So they don't have their own, so naturally, it's a packaged solution. And we're also seeing an offering we call Inseego Select that is kind of, if you will a bundled offer for select sales partners that would sell the complete package kind of in a rental type of model, which will add to recurring revenue, good recovery, high gross margin. So the answer is both. We're seeing strong interest and attached rates in both carrier and enterprise John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.
Mike Walkley: Great, thanks for taking my question. I guess first place to start is just good to learn that 4G levels are above pre-COVID areas, but just trying to get a cadence of, with the work from home and school from any where type of surge in demand. How should we think about the cadence for that business and the overall maybe IoT and mobile solutions businesses? Is Q1, the trough kind of a seasonally softer quarter and it builds throughout the year or there still may be a pocket of 4G coming out in Q2 and then a stronger second half of the year?
Dan Mondor: Yes. Hey, Mike. Thanks very much. And also a great question. Well, as we've said and mentioned on the earnings call previously, we are seeing our 4G demand levels for our newest generation hotspots, selling at higher levels than pre-COVID. So that is what we're seeing and we see no evidence of that trailing off. Now, I will say this, the onset of COVID and the dynamic that played out towards the end of the first quarter drove for 4G revenue, which was a combination of both -- some of our older legacy products that are coming near end of life as well as our newer generation, our cat 22, cat 2022 LTE products. So the dynamic that played out from 2020 to this year is, a number of those end of life, older 4G products have just tailed off. They were sold out. They're no longer sold in the market, they were naturally reaching their end of life and in fact, an up tick in demand accelerate at the end of life. So that revenue is being substituted now by our newest generation 4G products. And that's what I referred to as the run rate we're seeing is higher than pre COVID of those. And of course, now 5g is coming into the mix, software service is coming into the mix. So long story short, there's a substitution effect going on in our revenue composition. The good news is, what's driving revenue now is our latest generation LTE, in terms of that ongoing work from home demand and 5G and some of the newer products. So we have fresher, newer revenue that's making up our quarter Q1 and will make up the quarters going forward.
Mike Walkley: Thank you. And then, just as we think about gross margin trends may be on a short-term, is there any component constraints are tightening, inventory creating maybe some gross margin headwinds as you maybe expedite shipments or try to track down components? But then, it sounds like over time with software and with the mix changing, you should see gross margins, improving pretty steadily throughout the year.
Dan Mondor: Yes, I've heard an expression called chip are getting, I don't know if that one's caught on yet. But now, again, great question, Mike. And thanks for the question is obviously topical. So I think, as we said, we're doing a good job. And we did get out in front with the semiconductor dynamic going on with our key partners. We did advance purchases to secure components supply, which is reflected in some of our use of cash. And we see this prevailing -- this condition prevailing, I think through the end of this year, likely into the early part of '22. Now there's a lot of the technology companies are standing up new foundries billions going in, so there will be recovery in supply. So far, we have not seen -- we've not had customer deliveries impacted, we've not seen price increases. But having said that, if that does begin to occur, we will go back to our playbook last year where based on the demand, we've passed on price increases and we would fully expect to do that going forward. So that's a conversation we have with our customers. But I think the macro conditions are well understood. Because we keep our eye on the ball working on the forecasting and pre-planning, spending a lot of time with our customers talking about future demand and with our key silicon suppliers, securing supply.
Mike Walkley: Last question remain, I'll pass the line just good to see Sunrise Switzerland is a new 5G customer. Just any commentary on a pipeline for adding new carrier customers for either fixed wireless or overall hotspots for 5G in 2021?
Dan Mondor: Well, yes, in North America, I think we've talked about that we're super excited about fixed wireless opportunities in North America, throughout U.S. and Canada. Great start having T-Mobile certified three of our fixed wireless products. It is Fantastic. All the conversations we're having around the world involve both hotspot and fixed wireless. We're adding new carriers there, we're pursuing enterprise business. I would put it all in one category that we expect fixed wireless to start to take hold in the second half of this year in a big way. And I think there's two elements going forward, one is the consumer to the home broadband entertainment, we think the enterprise with a number of use cases will be an even bigger playbook for fixed wireless. So, we're spending a lot of effort on both enterprise and working with the carriers, tons of RFPs, tons of conversations. I think the markets are getting their bearings of how fixed wireless will play. Hotspots really started first, but now it's coming on strong. So we've seen good momentum going forward in fixed wireless.
Mike Walkley: Great. That sounds encouraging. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lance Vitanza with Cowen & Co.
Lance Vitanza: Thanks, guys for taking the questions. I guess I have two. The first is you've got the company on sound footing, but revenue came in a good bit softer than we were looking for. It sounds like though you were neither surprised nor disappointed with the revenue performance in the quarter. And if that's correct, it just leads me to think that the problem is to a certain extent around messaging. And so understanding of a new, seasoned CFO in place will Inseego adopts financial guidance at any point over the year, if not today, perhaps in conjunction with 2Q earnings this summer?
Dan Mondor: Yes. Hi, Lance. Thanks for the question. Well, as we were coming off and we indicated priorities call it, that we were going to see a lower level of demand for our 4G. A couple of things I mentioned that Q1 of last year and early in the Q2 had a number of our older generation, 4G USB prior generation hotspots that had come end of life. So that's a year-over-year faster in comparison. But in general then we were now to our 5G products ramping up and our 4G LTE the latest gen hotspot products ramping up. So as I said earlier, in one of the questions I responded to, there's a mix, a very different mix. So we saw, the first half of this year, generally a little lighter because of post-COVID. The good news is though, the demand level of our LTE hotspot is higher than pre-COVID. 5G is now a layer on top, it's not a substitution effect. So and as that builds as fixed wireless kicks in as 5G enterprise kicks and software, we see a bill throughout the year and that's our comment of second half stronger than the first half. On your question on guidance, we don't think it's prudent at this point in time, we did not provide guidance. There's a lot of dynamics going on our business, all the things I just mentioned, which are nicely additive, as well as the Ctrack, South Africa sale, we want to get that behind, and then we'll revisit, how we can communicate to the markets. But we just don't feel it's wise to provide guidance, previously, we still failed to think that we're not at the point that that's prudent. And we'll determine when we feel comfortable in the future. I think it's important to know that with all these new products, you need to reach kind of a normalized run rate before you have your bearings on what the ongoing revenue look like. So a lot of factors behind not providing guidance, it's not that we are not interested in doing it or we're just some are negative against it in general. It's just the dynamics going on the business. It's just not prudent at this point.
Lance Vitanza: Fair enough. Okay. So the other question I had and Bob, I think you'd mentioned on your prepared remarks that the 5G sell through in particular remain strong in that you expect, I think, if I get it right, you expect orders to harmonize going forward. So what I took from that is that the carriers were working off inventory in the quarter, is that right? And if that is the case, then did you or could you say when you expect to see the benefit of the sort of the replenishment, so to speak? Is that a 2Q? Or is that a H2 or is that a second half event? Thanks.
Bob Barbieri: Good question and thanks. This kind of dovetails a bit to what Dan just said, we do see those trends continuing and yellow, almost in perpetuity and specifically that's a q2 trend. But we're also looking forward to building that momentum, and then that'll shape, more color around forward look. And we'll also shape maybe rethinking in terms of quantitative guidance. So all of these trends are not . So what we're trying to do is just gauge that level of momentum, that level of adoption. So we can kind of move forward and articulate more strongly those details, if that's helpful to you.
Lance Vitanza: Thanks. Yes, it is, appreciate it.
Dan Mondor: Thanks. I guess I would add one other thing by the way that our highest, our largest 5G account, now is T-Mobile. It has typically been for this company  is going on strong demand level is good. It's not a cannibalization by the way of 5G to 4G, that's not what's occurring. It's additive. And T-Mobile is, thankfully, has jumped out in front is the largest 5G customer in Q1. And we expect to add more. So I think the trend is up to the right, the timing. We need to work through that. And once we get there, we'll have our bearings and be able to come back with better information.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Latimore with Northland Capital.
Aditya Dagaonkar: Hi, this is Aditya on behalf of Mike Latimore. Could you tell me how much did international revenue contribute in terms of percentage?
Dan Mondor: Yes. Hi. Good question. Well, I guess just the long story short, we don't break out the composition of revenue that way. So we are growing our international business. As you know, through none of the carrier win announcements, we talked about Western Europe, Japan, Australia other places. So international revenue is growing, it is still currently a relatively small percentage. And I think till such time, it reaches critical mass, we will then talk about absolute numbers. But at this point in time, we're not breaking out international revenue as a percent of the business.
Aditya Dagaonkar: All right, fine. Any idea as to when you might actually expect the 5G sales to exceed the 4G sales?
Dan Mondor: I would expect to see that in the back half of this year. I think we commented, we had a question like this previously on a prior call. So that was a comment, I made then. Yes. Same view, no change.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Searles with ROTH Capital.
Scott Searles: Dan, Bob, I hope you guys are doing well. I apologize. I got on the call a little bit late. So I apologize if this is redundant, but did you give any mix or breakdown between 4G and 5G? And I just heard that the prior come in now T-Mobile is your largest 5G customers. T-Mobile your largest overall customer?
Dan Mondor: Hey, Scott. Great questions. While we did say on the call that 5G was 20% of total revenue. And if you combine 5G and SaaS that reached in the neighborhood of 44% of total revenue. So that's just showing the differential in mix. T-Mobile isn't yet our largest customer. There's a large run rate of 4G, LTE sales continuing Verizon. It is, however, our largest 5G customer in terms of new products. So that's kind of the landscape there.
Scott Searles: Good. And maybe to follow up on the Verizon account. There were some issues with Franklin Wireless recall this quarter. I'm wondering if you've seen any pickup related to that? Do you get any of that opportunity? Or is your product more high-end than them using, for example, a lower end  solution?
Dan Mondor: Yes, so great question. They really don't cross over because it fundamentally is exactly as you said, our product is a higher end product geared for enterprise. Some of these other products you mentioned Franklin are so called lower end products. So they really actually don't overlap in the target markets. So, I guess Franklin's working through these issues. But there again, it's not really a market sector that that pulls on our product. So that's frankly a benefit the way we we'd like to see it.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Mondor for any closing remarks.
Dan Mondor: Great, thanks. Well, great questions to end on. Thanks again, everyone for joining us today and tuning in. We're off to a great start to what we certainly expect to be a fantastic year with our new revenue streams from 5G, fixed wireless, SaaS and enterprise as the main events and recurring revenue growth with strong margins. So thanks again, everyone. Take care, everyone.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
