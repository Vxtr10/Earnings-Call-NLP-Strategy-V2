Angus Pacala: Hi everyone. We've accomplished a lot in the recent months highlighted by the strategic acquisition of Sense Photonics, which bolsters our position in the automotive market and our continued technology advancements in commercial traction in the non-automated market. In the third quarter, Ouster continued to gain market share across each of our four verticals: Automotive, Industrial, Smart Infrastructure, and Robotics.  We generated $7.8 million in revenue and gross margins of 24%. We continue to ramp production, shipping over 1,630 sensors. We added over 80 new customers and increased our total number of strategic customer agreements, our SCAs from 53 to 62. Collectively, these SCAs represent roughly $470 million in contracted revenue opportunity through 2025, which give us confidence that we are well-positioned to meaningfully grow our revenue over the coming years.  Turning to leadership and governance. Ouster recently announced the appointment of Global Automotive Leader, Karin Radstrom to our Board of Directors. Karin is an invaluable addition that further solidifies Ouster's automotive expertise. She brings over 15 years of automotive experience through her current role as CEO of Mercedes-Benz Trucks, and board member at Daimler Trucks, and past roles leading sales and marketing at Scania.  Earlier today, Ouster announced the formation of an advisory board made up of industry luminaries with deep knowledge and expertise across our addressable markets, and decades of combined experience building and leading global enterprises.  Our founding Advisory Board members are current and former executive leaders from companies spending the industrial, automotive and smart infrastructure sectors, including Siemens, AM General, SLYR, Honda, and Acura, ABB, GE, Porsche, Cummins, Vitesco, Marelli, ZF Group and Ford.  We're moving quickly to enable automation and multiple industries and our Advisory Board and Board of Directors have decades of combined experience at some of the most innovative companies in the industries we serve. This experience will be invaluable, shaping our strategy and technology offering as we've aimed to capture our multi-billion dollar TAM.  Since its inception, Ouster is committed to building a safer and more efficient future through the mass adoption of Digital Lidar across our four industry verticals. To do so, we focused on developing a wide array of lidar products spanning scanning and solid-state product families, all based on our performance and affordable Digital Lidar technology to meet a wide range of customer applications from port and yard logistics to consumer vehicles.  With the acquisition of Sense Photonics, we formed Ouster Automotive, a new functional division of the Company focused on driving mass market adoption of Digital Lidar in consumer and commercial vehicles. Lead by former sense CEO Shauna McIntire. As a result, we've accelerated our automotive product road map, and commercial engagements by over a year.  Furthermore, we increased our IP portfolio to over 50 granted, and 200 pending patents, and 250 exclusively licensed patents. It has been and is our belief that the  industry will be dominated by digital technology. And it has been critical for Ouster to expand its IP in this space.  We also grew our team to over 300 full-time and contracted employees. We're building a digital ladder powerhouse to win across verticals and maintain our competitive lead for years to come. Ouster automotive is building the short, medium, and long range sensor suite that automakers are asking for and offering it at the performance and price points that automakers need.  And we believe that CMOS digital lidar is the only technology that can deliver on all of these together. Last week, we introduced our digital flash DF series of short, medium and long range solid-state lidar sensors.  With absolutely no moving parts, the DF series is built for best-in-class performance, reliability, and affordability, and is designed to meet automaker requirements for advanced ADAS, while seamlessly integrating into the vehicle architecture and design.  Combining the best of Ouster's previous solid-state roadmap with the core technology of our recently acquired solid-state platform, Ouster Automotive is developing the DF series for high-volume automotive programs with an anticipated start of production in 2025. Automakers are looking for multi-sensor lidar suites for a combined price of roughly $1,000.  And we believe Digital Lidar is the only technology that can realistically meet that requirement. But this is just the beginning. Over time, we believe that the cost of automotive Lidar has the potential to follow a similar trajectory to that of modern radar and automotive camera systems, reaching the low 100s of dollars.  Like radar and digital cameras, Digital Lidar technology is moving down the cost curve to meet automotive requirements, to one day become a standard offering in on-road vehicles. Ouster Automotive is a one-stop-shop, but is uniquely positioned to deliver on OEM requirements with a single supplier offering, reducing overall costs and making us an ideal partner for automotive OEMs and Tier ones alike.  Based on the exceptional performance of our functional prototype DF sensors, Ouster anticipates that it will achieve automotive readiness for the entire platform, including automotive quality and ASIL-D functional safety certification, in time for series production programs with the started production in 2025.  While we'll continue to ship functional prototypes to automotive OEMs today, we expect to have samples available by Q2 2022 and B samples by Q4 2023. We're excited about Ouster's ability to deliver on our flagship development deal with a global automotive OEM, awarded to sense earlier this year.  In October, we shipped functional solid-state sensors and progressed to onsite testing on Bid Lidar in collaboration with our OEM partner, achieving another major milestone in the strategic development agreement. Ouster Automotive has also continued to advance negotiations for 5 different series production programs, collectively worth over $1 billion in potential revenue, with an aggregate demand of up to 1.5 million vehicles.  These potential customers are sourcing a multi-sensor lidar suite for L-3 systems for  production in the 2025 to 2026 timeframe. This is further proof of the market need for multi-sensor lidar suites and the value that Ouster brings as a single Company positioned to meet that need. We expect these programs to be determined within the next 24 months; and we feel well-positioned to win one or more in the next year.  I look forward to updating the market on our progress over subsequent quarters. Ouster has also continued to drive progress across the rest of the business, delivering on our product roadmap for our OS scanning sensors, and signing new customers across all of our industry verticals. A couple of weeks ago, we introduced our most powerful CMOS chip yet, the L2X, which will power Ouster's newest OS sensors.  The L2X is capable of delivering double the data rate of the prior chip while maintaining the same small size and low power draw, and providing even richer point cloud data to improve all weather performance of our sensors. Last quarter, we completed our L3 chip tape out, which will deliver another massive boost in performance and we're looking forward to our  partner completing the chip fabrication.  Both the L2X and forthcoming L3 chip demonstrate our ability to rapidly improve performance through the digital roadmap. We also partnered with NVIDIA to develop a dedicated NVIDIA DriveWorks plug-in to further simplify integration of our complete OS sensor suite onto autonomous vehicle platforms.  With now over 30 perception software partners and system integrators across our major markets, we intend to further accelerate the adoption of Digital Lidar across industrial, smart infrastructure and robotic applications. We're also seeing fantastic engagement with Ouster software development kit or SDK. And then the last month alone, we saw hundreds of external downloads. A few weeks ago, we released a new version of our SDK as part our new L2X chip. And I'm incredibly happy with the response from the development community so far. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Anna Brunelle to provide an update on our quarterly financial results, customer traction and business outlook.
Anna Brunelle: Thank you, Angus. Before moving on to the quarterly results, I want to reiterate the importance of our acquisition as it is both revenue and technology accretive for Ouster. Under the terms of the agreement, Ouster acquired 100% of Sense Photonics and all of its property for approximately 10 million shares of Ouster common stock.  This acquisition is expected to help Ouster accelerate the capture of our multi-billion-dollar TAM by executing on our hiring goals and product roadmap on a faster timeline without significant impact to our cost structure.  Even with the headcount increase resulting from this all stock deal, Ouster management expects that the additional OpEx spend in 2022 excluding stock-based compensation, will be offset by R&D savings related to our solid-state product roadmap chip tape outs and design fees that same year.  Ouster’s ability to compete for design wins with the Digital Flash solid-state series also puts us in an excellent position to ramp automotive revenues sooner than expected. Through our acquisition, we are working with a major automotive OEM on our flagship development deal, shipping solid-state sensors in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, and progressing to onsite testing in October 2021.  We are excited about our momentum and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver on key milestones and progress towards series production. We also continue to advance negotiations for the 5 Automotive Series Production Programs collectively worth over $1 billion in potential revenue with an aggregate demand of up to 1.5 million vehicles.  Each of these potential programs is focused on securing a multi-sensor lidar suite that is performant, reliable, and highly manufacturable at a price point that will enable vehicle adoption. As Angus mentioned, we expect the potential programs to be determined within the next 24 months and look forward to providing more details. Turning to our third quarter performance.  Ouster generated a record $7.8 million in revenue, up 31% over the third quarter of 2020. We shipped over 1,630 sensors, a 127% increase over the third quarter of 2020. With approximately 4,100 sensors sold this year through the third quarter, we have nearly tripled the number of sensors sold over the same period in the prior year.  We also delivered gross margins of 24% up from 18% in the third quarter of 2020. We believe we're the only public Lidar Company with positive hardware gross margins. And this is largely because we have chosen the right technology, CMOS Digital Lidar, which makes our sensors one of the most affordable and most performant on the market.  Over time, we expect our average cost per unit sold will continue to decline faster than our average selling price as our sales volumes continue to increase. We expect this will allow us to meet our revenue and gross margin targets, in spite of headwinds from continued supply chain challenges.  We continue to monitor potential downside risks associated with the worldwide semiconductor chip shortage and our ability to control purchase price variance and customer timelines. As of the third quarter earnings, these shortages have not materially impacted our ability to ship sensors to our customers.  However, we continue to experience temporary purchase price variance related to bulk purchases and expedited shipment fee in order to keep up with product demand. Over the last quarter, we grew our customer pipeline by 80 new customers, with nearly half of new customers coming from the Robotics vertical.  Our largest revenue growth from new and existing customers has been in the automotive sector, making up 41% of sales in the third quarter, and 34% of sales year-to-date. As our pipeline grows, we believe Ouster’s revenue will continue to ramp for the remainder of the year. While we are excited about large deals that we anticipate will close in the fourth quarter, deal timelines and uncertainties exist.  But our commercial and manufacturing teams have continued to deliver, giving us confidence that we'll meet our fourth-quarter forecast. As such, we are reaffirming our full-year 2021 guidance of $33 million to $35 million in revenue, and 25% to 27% gross margins. Further, as anticipated, we will provide full-year guidance for 2022 during our fourth-quarter 2021 earnings release.  Over the last quarter, we converted an additional 9 pre -production and production level customers to a strategic customer agreement or SCA. This means to-date, Ouster has signed 62 SCAs representing approximately $470 million in contracted revenue opportunity through 2025, up from 53 SCAs and $422 million at the end of the second quarter. Most notably, we increased the value of our binding agreements by 39% this quarter versus Q2 2021.  New SCA customers that we have announced publicly include Local Motors, Perrone Robotics, and GSN, for which we plan to supply over 1,000 scanning sensors for autonomous vehicle applications through 2023, with a forecasted opportunity for tens of thousands of additional sensors through 2025.  These customers use 3 to 6 sensors per vehicle and plan to deploy their next-generation systems as early as the fourth quarter of this year. As we stated in previous quarters, we believe SCAs are an important benchmark for us. They establish a multiyear purchase and supply framework for Ouster and the customer and include detail about the customer programs and applications where Ouster products will be used.  They also include multiyear non-binding customer forecasts, giving Ouster visibility to the customers long-term purchasing requirements, mutually agreed upon pricing for specific Ouster products over the duration of the agreement and in some cases, include multiyear binding purchase commitments.  Contracted revenue opportunity represents the sum of both binding and non-binding purchase commitments, and no additional revenue opportunity has been included beyond the customer's actual forecast.  When we became a public Company last March, we committed to using the cash proceeds to build out our sales and marketing teams, accelerate our hardware roadmap, and strengthen investments in software development to take advantage of our growing multi-billion-dollar TAM.  We have progressed on these commitments, efficiently using capital while executing on our business strategy and driving additional value. Through our all-stock acquisition of Sense Photonics, we significantly accelerated our automotive product roadmap, while simultaneously building our automotive-focused sales and marketing, and engineering teams with minimal impact to our planned cost structure. We did not stop there.  We scaled sensor production with our contract manufacturer at our IATF 16949 certified Thailand facility, continued to improve sensor performance, most recently with the introduction of our L2X chip, which we expect to increase demand for our scanning sensors. And expanded our commercial footprint with new distribution, perception software’s, and integration partners, furthering the adoption of our digital lidar across our end markets.  These are the important achievements across our capital allocation plan. And we were able to do so while maintaining a cash balance of $224 million at the end of the third quarter. This leaves us room to continue to grow our business within our 4 industry verticals, execute on our path to significant automotive growth.  Further improve sensor performance across the board with our L3 chip and DS solid-state Series, and make key investments in software that will drive faster customer adoption and stickiness.  Through Ouster's differentiated CMOS digital lidar technology, and diversified multimarket approach, we are able to take advantage of near-term opportunities across each of our 4 verticals, allowing us to build towards a stable commercial run rate, while also taking additional steps with the formation of Ouster Automotive to position ourselves to further grow our market share in the automotive vertical, one of the largest addressable market opportunities with design wins for high-volume series production programs.  In short, Ouster continues to execute on its business strategy, and I am incredibly excited about the road ahead. With that I would like to turn it back over to Angus for some closing remarks.
Angus Pacala: Thanks, Anna. Ouster is here to build a safer, more efficient world by delivering best-in-class lidar hardware and solutions that will transform industries and improve quality of life. Three takeaways continue to separate Ouster from the rest of the industry: our differentiated technology, our diversified business, and our proven ability to execute. I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished to date and beyond excited about what's to come. And I look forward to answering your questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . When called upon, please limit yourselves to 2 questions. Our first question today comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird, please go ahead.
Tristan Gerra: Hi. Good afternoon. First question is regarding the top-line. So by reiterating the full-year revenue guidance, you are implying some inflection point in your quarterly revenue for the December quarter.  If you could provide some color on what creates that inflection point and also, how should we look at the mix of revenue today? Is there a substantial amount of  easing your current revenue, trying to perhaps get there a bit more color on your gross margin profile, what it is to competition?
Anna Brunelle: Yeah this is on --
Sarah Ewing: I can jump in and -- go ahead Anna.
Anna Brunelle: Sorry about that.  and say that in terms of the fourth quarter, as we've worked through the year and continued to release new products and develop deeper relationships with customers; our pipeline has continued to grow. Our SCA deals have continued to grow and that visibility is what has allowed us to reiterate guidance for the fourth quarter. And I'll just pause there because I think Angus wanted to answer also.
Angus Pacala: Yeah. I think the entire year has been building towards a mature team, mature business systems, and mature customers by the -- by Q4. We've been investing huge amounts to get to this point from the start of the year, or from really March when we went public.  And so, on top of the fact that Q4 has always been kind of historically our biggest quarter, and there are a lot of year-end tailwinds for our business, we just have been investing all year, and now we have this ramp team and a lot of great visibility into our customer base, and mature -- and maturing customers.  So for all those reasons, we're able to reaffirm the guidance for the year. And then in terms of -- you had a question about NRE and historically, we've had no NRE in the business, so I think -- excuse me, for the 2021 revenue numbers, we haven't really been splitting that out, but the NRE versus hardware sales, but I think the vast majority, if not, all revenue has been product revenue. Though, that may change in the future.
Tristan Gerra: Great, that's very . And then for my follow-up question, if you could provide  more details on the NVIDIA engagement that you mentioned on the call, as well as your efforts in terms of software for, specifically, highway autonomy, and what are your goals there in terms of having a platform that goes beyond just object recognition.
Angus Pacala: Yes. And so NVIDIA is one part of one kind of aspect of our software strategy at Ouster. And I can walk you through kind of the overall strategy to help put that in context. But we're taking a multi-pronged approach, because we have this diversified business around how we provide value in the  stack to our customers. And you can think of it as almost a pyramid of -- building the foundation up.  And the first and most important thing is to have core hardware that is winning business and winning sockets at customers. Without that, we don't get in the door and we don't have the opportunity to sell software. So this really all relies on highly sticky a long-term engagement with our customers through hardware, riding on top of that though is the opportunity to enable our customer set to software development tools.  Some of which are developed in-house, specifically with our SDK, which we've been talking about and released earlier this year and  updated. But some of that through software integrations with partners across our diversified end markets. And so that's where NVIDIA sits right now.  That NVIDIA DriveWorks plug-in is a way for our sensors to seamlessly work in the NVIDIA ecosystem for the customers that have selected that ecosystem as kind of their go-forward plan on the software side. But if you go to our website, we actually have 30  customer -- excuse me, it's 30 integrators and partners listed on our website, that span different verticals.  NVIDIA specifically is one focused on more highway autonomy, as you pointed out. But we have integrators that are in the industrial space, to the agricultural space, to the robotics space and so -- or in automotive. And then there is -- and then we are able to provide, in certain cases, full solutions and complete solutions where it makes sense.  Building upon our hardware or SDK, and then the solution space, and investing in that. And we mentioned in Q2 that we had opened a solutions office out of Ottawa, Canada, and we've continued to hire into that solution software arm of the business. And we'll be providing updates as they come in the next couple of quarters.
Tristan Gerra: Great. Thanks for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Itay Micheaeli with Citi, please go ahead.
Itay Micheaeli: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Just two questions from me. One first on the quarter, and the outlook on the gross margin side, maybe for Anna. Was there any material supply chain or other costs of the affected gross margin this quarter, and maybe could affect gross margin in the fourth quarter as well?
Anna Brunelle: I mean, we talked a bit in our prepared remarks about how we're still seeing some headwinds from the worldwide as global problem around semiconductor shortages and part shortages. And so, we'll continue to monitor that downside risk, and we continue to work to control the purchase price variance and meet our customer timelines.  And I think the answer is yes, we have seen some impact. We still maintained 24%  gross margins this quarter; we were still able to ensure that all of our customers got the products that they needed. And so other than some additional pressure on our margins right now, we don't see it as having an impact on the business.
Itay Micheaeli: Great. That's very helpful. And then just secondly, a longer-term question on Automotive gross margin. Now that you completed Sense Photonics transaction and you're looking for  potentially  the 5 series production programs, any updated thoughts to the prior 25% long-term gross margin target within auto? Is that still kind of right number or is that changed? Just with the recent acquisition.
Anna Brunelle: Yes. I mean, I think you're  to the materials put out like a year ago. Oh, go ahead, Angus.
Angus Pacala: Yeah. Well, I was going to say we don't see any reason to change that thinking; that was based on pretty good understanding of the automotive margins that a year ago -- and nothing has significantly changed there. I think that the overarching theme though was from then, and continues to now be that we have more realistic expectations on hardware margins in auto than our peer set.  We're expecting 25% margins, we know this is a price dominated industry and the Sense acquisition has absolutely confirmed that price is one of the most, if not the most important aspect, of this technology in winning deals.  And that just goes back to; we are extraordinarily well-positioned to offer the most competitive pricing in the industry for high performance products. And we're being realistic about hardware margin s as well and  the business on it. So no real update there, but a reconfirmation of the  that we went into the year with.
Anna Brunelle: Well, what I think, also  too really quickly that we also have really strong insight into our cost structure. We are already doing outsource manufacturing of our products for many years.  And so I think we have more confidence than our peer group and what our costs will actually be, having products in market for a long time now, and also working with benchmark, our certified facility for manufacturing and timelines. And so, in my mind I think that we feel pretty good about what we've put out and should things change, we'll continue to talk about that with you all.
Itay Micheaeli: Perfect. That's all. That's all very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Angus, I know you only recently acquired, but I'm just curious if you could speak to the automotive pipeline, particularly the  one. I mean, you said you passed some key milestones, they have the product. And maybe you could just walk us through timing of next milestones before you can get to a more definitive when there.
Angus Pacala: Sure. So what we said in the call is that all of these 5 deals will be determined in the next 24 months. Because any automotive deal that's moving to series production, they have a date selected. And in our case, 2025 to 2026, where the winning party suppliers must be selected as specific amount of time beforehand to actually commercialize the technology and get it into manufacturing and production.  And so every one of these will be decided. And we -- I'm confident that one or more of them will actually go in our favor in the next year -- a little in the next 24 months. But this isn't the end. It's not like they're just 5 deals out there in automotive LiDar. There's a rolling set of opportunities.  And as opportunities fall off, new ones come into play. And so we will always be, kind of, chasing new opportunities that come in the 2026 and 2027 time-frame and that will just continue to move out as time goes on. So I -- my expectation, and I'm confident that we'll be able to close something in the next 12 months, that a series production win with 1 of these 5 deals.
Blayne Curtis: I just want to follow-up on Tristan's question on it, for the -- I know you only guide annual and obviously you have one more quarter to go, so you're effectively guiding December and it's a large step up. So I just have two questions.  One, I think Sense Photonics has very little revenue, but I just wanted to make sure, I think Angus said no NRE, so I just want to make sure there's no contribution for any material contribution in the Q4 time-frame. And then maybe just a little bit more color speaking to, you've grown revenue, but it's been very small as early days. What's driving this big step up for December?
Anna Brunelle: Yeah, I mean, I think just what Angus and I talked about when we, to kind of a similar question a minute ago is that, we've more than doubled the size of our sales and marketing teams over the course of the year. We continue to release new products. We're just moving forward with the momentum on the business and we've been signing SCA  customers giving us insight into their production plans.  So I think that's where we're moving. Your point about Sense historically, having small numbers of revenue is accurate. And so obviously moving forward, we'll be combining the Sense forecast into the Ouster forecast in building one combined forecast, which is what we're doing now for December.  And to the extent of your question around NRE, obviously, we've talked a bit about the 5 connection deals, production deals that we're discussing right now, and moving towards closure hopefully for the next 24 months. But those deals could very well come with NRE down the road, absolutely. But this year historically, we have not seen a significant NRE, Our hardware sales are making up our revenue for 2021.
Blayne Curtis: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.
Richard Shannon: Thanks for taking my questions. I think I have a follow-up on the last one here, is I think it's going to be the big question that investors will be asking until your next conference call here. So I guess if we'd be able to weigh, I will ask it is: Are you expecting one or a very small number of deals to help you bridge between the third and fourth quarter, I mean, just bottling through the bottom end here requires 45% sequential growth. So just want to get a sense of whether this is a lot of smaller deals or a few larger ones, at least relative to your current base here. If you could provide us details, that'd be great, please.
Anna Brunelle: Yeah. I mean, I think we continue to add quite a few customers every quarter. We added 80 new customers in Q3. So obviously, we don't continue to sell to a large number of customers. I think we are questioned around, are we seeing more activity from larger customers as the business grows and over time? Then, yes, that's our expectation.
Richard Shannon: Okay. My 2nd question, probably for Angus, is talked about the profile of end markets here with your SCAs and I think maybe even the engagement or the pipeline for SCAs here. You specifically called out Robotics. Maybe if you can talk about the dynamics of that space here.  That sort of market specifically is historically driven by cameras and other sensors and obviously, lidar's a bit more expensive right now than some of those sensor modalities. So what are you seeing here that these Robotics customers need lidar? What are they looking at? Maybe any profile for the big pickup in engagement there.
Angus Pacala: Sure. I mean, when you think Robotics, you think smaller form factor, battery - operated devices, , flying, walking,  machines. And that requires a certain type of product that can hit form factor or size, weight power, and price point to enable putting it onto the -- onto that platform.  And that's really one of digital lidar sweet spot, the ability to hit all of those --  smallest devices is  sensors on the market, most power efficient, lightest weight, all of that combined makes it really an ideal sensor for putting on these smaller form factor robotics applications.  Great examples of that are the -- the Amazon -- excuse me, the Postmates -- excuse me, Serve Robotics, last mile delivery robots, we have a number of different delivery robotics customers at this point, smart drones, 3D surveying applications renewed like a device going on a flying vehicle.  And then warehouse robotics is another example, where you have smaller scale logistics vehicles that are battery operated in a lot of cases. So that now -- and then combining just product specifications with the price point enables the whole industry. So I think that's why we're hitting an inflection point with that customer set and our products today.
Richard Shannon: And I guess just a follow-up on that last one here, varying prices, that your price -- forward pricing roadmap here, that's getting a lot of interest here. So you're calling -- or maybe suggesting that the activity here is based on share of mind because of that.
Angus Pacala: Say that again.
Richard Shannon: Your last comment there was about leveraging the digital -- Digital CMOS Lidar technology, or lower costs here  engagement profiling Robotics is that essentially kind of talking about an increase in mindshare for Ouster. The competition.
Angus Pacala: Sure. Well, I mean, we're able to -- 1 of our core goals here is to provide pricing that enables vast new applications across our 4 verticals. That's necessary in automotive, obviously, but it's true across our verticals. And obviously, our goal is to do that while dropping COGS faster than enabling volume pricing and we have very high confidence that we're going to continue to do that, and we clearly have.  We have done that historically. So there's no question that Ouster is -- there's an awareness in the market that Ouster can provide extraordinarily compelling combinations of price, form factor, and performance that's uniquely positioned to capture things like this new, emerging robotics applications.
Richard Shannon: I appreciate all the detail. That's all for me. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cassidy: Thank you. And congratulations on the great progress you're making. And with that, you talked about you wanted to build out your sales and marketing effort. But the new partnerships you have with distribution, can you give a little more details on what the nature of that is? Which markets are they going to address? And are they stocking distributors or do they create demand?
Angus Pacala: Yeah. Its most of our partners, if you go to our website there is a partner stage, again with around 30 partners on it. They're mostly value-add resellers of some kind, integrators. But not just pure distribution, and that most of our end customers requires some value-add engineering of some sort. And there's a rich ecosystem that's cropped up to help supply that to our customer set.  So we are selective with who we're working with and we want of that companies across each one of our verticals and really sub verticals to make sure that they are well-positioned, to actually sell our products in our behalf and the market then, and there's a good relationship there. So it's not a pure distributor relationship in those cases, which we view as a good thing right now.
Kevin Cassidy: Yeah, that's great, okay. And also the -- when you look further outlook, what percentage of your revenue do you think would go through those distributors?
Angus Pacala: I don't think I can give you direction. I think that a healthy business -- we will have a small minority of our business go through distributors just because if you look at things like our SCAs or any of our -- any of the internal information we have around major customer ramps, whether it's our SCA customers or our Automotive customers. There is such, such volume growth across the key larger accounts that they will dominate the maybe the long tail. In when we get to 3 or 4 years from now.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Jonathan Bailey with Argos. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Bailey: Thank you. Angus, Anna, congratulations on another stellar  of momentum and delivery. I'm intrigued by the advisory board you put together, their backgrounds and resumes kind of compelling. I'd like to understand how you plan to use them and how the compensation, .
Angus Pacala: Sure. So thanks for the question. This is a great initiative that we've taken in the last quarter, and it's a really impressive group of people. And we're looking at -- well, first of all, they're compensated with a bit of equity in Ouster. So there's no -- it's just, they're mostly doing this as an -- -- it's a really interesting place, I think, to advise for just because we have such a diversity of customers that you can learn a lot about the global shift in autonomy.  That's very relevant to -- if you're an executive leading and global organization. So I think there's a compelling reason why these people are interested in advising Ouster, and there's been compensation to go with it, but I am excited about the opportunity to learn from each 1 of these people about their requisite industries.  And this goes back to as Ouster learns more about our verticals and we have more and more customers, we start identifying sub-verticals that are worth going after and having a more targeted go-to-market strategy. And I think that's really where -- that's one of the places where this Advisory Board is going to be super informative and helpful, you go-to-market strategy by sub-vertical that they have deep decades of experience on.  And then I think the other thing is, most of these people have had experience running global organizations, and Ouster is fast becoming a global organization and  building is deeply important for our ongoing success, and they're going to be able to advise me and the other executives here on that as well.
Jonathan Bailey: Thank you. And just on -- obviously,  for '22 guidance next quarter. And I understand you want to complete the  with any specificity. That said, we'll be speaking in the 9 months since you've been public.  Would you say that you feel more or less confident and excited about the development over the multiyear period? Are you learning things and  relationships build that make you more or less confident about the longer term projections we had at the time of the ?
Anna Brunelle: I can take a quick stab at that and just say -- just accelerating our automotive program by a single year, as we've talked about through the acquisition. That has the potential to add really significant revenue in the out years of that early forecast that we've put out some months ago.  And so when you look back on all of the activities that we've reported over the last 9 months, we've continued to do everything that we've told the streets that we would do and more, and so we're very happy with all of the execution that we've seen and a lot of that was covered in our prepared remarks, whether it was on the roadmap for the L2X chip set tape out, or the new SDK activity that we had earlier in the year, etc.  I mean, we've just been firing on all cylinders and really fulfilling all of the promises, so to speak, that we made when we went public several months ago. So I think we're really excited about where we're at, and we're really excited about where the future is, and we're really excited about how this acquisition is going to really solidify our position as a leader in automotive. And I think it heavily de– the forecast that we've put out and potentially in the out-years, adds some additional growth opportunities from pulling in that timeline.
Jonathan Bailey: Anna, that's fantastic. Once again, congratulations. Great quarter.
Operator: That does conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Angus Pacala for any closing remarks.
Angus Pacala: Great. Thank you all for tuning in for our earnings call. I am incredibly excited about what lies ahead for Ouster. I think we had a fantastic quarter and the Digital LiDar strategy with diversified technology -- differentiated technology, diversified markets, and our ability to actually make good on that plan have continued to prove themselves and so I'm looking forward to the next year ahead. Thank you, all.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."
