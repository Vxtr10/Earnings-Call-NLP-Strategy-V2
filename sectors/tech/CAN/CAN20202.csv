Nangeng Zhang: [Foreign Language] Hello, everyone. This is Nangeng Zhang, Chairman and the CEO of Canaan Inc. I will now provide a brief overview of our progress in second quarter of 2020. [Foreign Language] During the quarter Bitcoins price volatility declined in comparison to the first quarter as a result of the Bitcoin halving event in May 2020. As Bitcoins price began to recover in the post-halving period during the second quarter we recorded a meaningful improvements on a sequential basis in our financial and operating performances. [Foreign Language] Most notably, our total net revenues increased by 160.8% quarter-over-quarter to RMB178.1 million, driven by a 198.5% sequential increase in our total computing power sold and a 153.5% sequential increase in the number of Bitcoin mining machines sold during the quarter. In addition, we also improved our profitability as we grow our gross profit to RMB43.3 million in the second quarter from RMB2.4 million in the prior quarter, while significantly narrowing our net loss to RMB16.8 million in the second quarter from RMB39.9 million in the prior quarter. [Foreign Language] This strong performance was a testimony to our ability to rejuvenate our business and financial growth, as Bitcoin prices stabilized in the post-halving period. Additionally, China's raining season brought an excess of hydropower in the second quarter, making electricity cheaper and mining more profitable. As a result, the welcoming environment for Bitcoin and the Blockchain has accelerated with a rebound of market demand for mining machines. In fact, during the second quarter, we came close to clearing out our entire inventory, and our Bitcoin mining machines that are now currently under production in the third quarter have all been pre-ordered. To date, we have already started accepting pre-orders for mining machine deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2020 and early 2021. These pre-orders will result in significant increase in customer advances and prepaid expenses in the third quarter. We are encouraged by the strong market demand. [Foreign Language] Meanwhile, we further strengthened our research and development capabilities to ensure that our products maintain the position at the cutting-edge of technology for innovation, after mass production - after mass producing the first generation of the Samsung 8-nanometer chip in the first quarter, we completed the R&D process for the second generation of the same chip in the second quarter. During our tests, the second generation chip has displayed a 20% overall improvement in comparison to its predecessors [ph]. We are planning to utilize the new generation of the Samsung 8-nanometer chip to begin our mass production of new Bitcoin mining machines on early September. [Foreign Language] In addition, during the second quarter we completed the tape-out [ph] process for the SMIC first generation N+1 chip which was one of the first N+1 chips to have a successful tape-out at SMIC. In late August, we have already received the N+1chip from SMIC and its performance during the test has exceeded our expectations. Currently, we are expecting to start delivering mining machines with the N+1 chip in the middle of the fourth quarter. [Foreign Language] Before refining our product offerings, we also remain committed to the expansion of our overseas customer base. In Kazakhstan, for example we have secured multiple large scale purchase orders from local mining companies, such as A2 [ph] Group Limited and AMEC. Furthermore, we are currently in the process of tendering several international Bitcoin mining firms, each of which involves more than ten thousand machines. As of now, we are optimistic about our ability to secure these projects. And we will continue to keep the market updated to our – on our progress. [Foreign Language] As the price of the Bitcoin stabilized in the post-halving period, the market demand for high quality mining machines is nobly [ph] However, the global capacity for wafer fabrication and the dispersion has been impacted by a series of factors, such as a COVID-19 pandemic, and geopolitical issues. To ensure that we can continue delivering our products to customers in the coming markets, we have made sure to place a sufficient number of orders with our production partners. Nonetheless, as a result of our efforts to diversify our supply sources since 2019, we are well prepared to fulfill our customer's orders and drive our business expansion going forward. [Foreign Language] In terms of our AI products, we remain focused on expanding our AI partnership and accelerating the monetization of our AI products during the second quarter as COVID-19 outbreak is gradually brought out under control in China, we believe that the social distancing practice people have developed during the epidemic will help to accelerate the digitization process for governments agents, businesses and individuals. [Foreign Language] In line with this strategic focus, we partnered with VergeSense, a US based workplace management service provider specializing in sensor hardware and SaaS solutions. Through this partnership, our K210 chips will be implemented in VergeSense new generation of motion sensors developed to analyze safe, social distances [indiscernible] the pandemic, mass production for this new generation of motion sensors began in July. [Foreign Language] On the previous earnings call, we mentioned that we had developed the intelligent door lock system capable of running facial recognition on people wearing masks. This system is now available on the markets and the system orders are ramping up. [Foreign Language] In addition, during the second quarter DJI Technology selected our K210 chips for one of its STEM education project. This product was launched in July and we expect it to start implementing our chips into DJI Technologies product in late 2020 or early 2021. Moreover, our AI products jointly developed with both the leading STEM learning solution provider UBTECH and the leading developer of [indiscernible] to stabilize clearly intuition information have began production testing. [Foreign Language] We are also working around the clock to develop our next generation AI chip, the K510. The new chip has already received a large number of customer requests for testing, and we expect to start mass production before the first quarter of 2021. At the same time, we have maintained our commitment to integrating our AI products into our open source community. Our strategic goal is to build an open source AI application platform. [Foreign Language] Recently we also announced the changes to our organizational structure and the Board of Directors. The new additions to our executive team will help to ensure that we have an in-depth understanding of the future trends in the high tech industry. Additionally, these executive change have also helped to ensure that our management team has extensive experience not only in the IT industry, but also in global markets strategic planning at the corporate governance. We firmly believe that effective corporate governance will enable us to generate the most value for both our company and our shareholders going forward. [Foreign Language] Although the global economy is still facing uncertainties, we are confident that the technology transcends borders and the world becomes a vital tool for us to enhance society's operational efficiencies and improve everyone's way of life.

In the second quarter of 2019, a total of RMB213.1 million in share-based compensation allocated to general and administrative expenses was caused by the excess of appraised fair value over the transfer price of ordinary shares transferred from the existing shareholders to other existing shareholders who were also employees.

Turning to our balance sheet, as of June 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of RMB157 million compared to RMB516.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was mainly due to higher short-term investments.

We purchased the short-term financial products to receive higher returns, but no withdraw restrictions. So this concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Charles Investments. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Thank you very much. I apologize I don't speak Chinese. So I have that - the question in English. Can you make any comments on deposits made by customers for orders for your mining equipment?
Nangeng Zhang: [Foreign Language] Okay. Our existing customer orders are mainly from the A10 series product, and this is part of because the A10 product was more mature. And in the second quarter our sales are mostly - are selling based on - selling on our inventory. And starting from the third quarter, our inventory was completely sold. So the new orders - are now - future orders are booking - our future new series of products. This is fairly a common practice in our industry, and especially for big orders they normally - you'd have to wait for a certain period. Now that our expected delivery time is between the third quarter this year and first quarter next year, the delivery time it's bit longer, it's because of the processing and manufacturing of the foundry takes a longer time. Recently our number of orders are increasing because our new product series has better performance and better price - cost efficiency.
