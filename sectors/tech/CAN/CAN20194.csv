Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of [James Carrion] from [indiscernible] Capital. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: I will translate from myself. Congratulations on the results. I would like to know the combination of power market share for the last fourth quarter of 2019. As Kevin has mentioned that the product Canadian power has increased around 86.6% year on a year. So like to know the market share and the conditions of the peers of other manufactured. Thank you.
Shaoke Li: Our CFO Mr. Quanfu Hong will answer this question.
Quanfu Hong: So, as for the fourth quarter of 2019, so the major product still is indiscernible] miner, which increased its computing power a lot. And for the fourth quarter, we still in total 290 million terahash, which is like a 50% increase compared with the same period of 2018. As we don’t have the other manufacturers’ data or financial reports, so we are not positive for the market share for the fourth quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: So, my second question is regarding the computable power on the first quarter of 2020, as some managements has based on outlook of the first quarter sales that which is no less than 16 million. So in computable powers side, which is the level regarding their results?
Quanfu Hong: So, we expect to adapt for the first quarter of 2020, the computing power so it would be $0.85 million terahash per second.
Unidentified Analyst: So my third question regarding the cost of revenues as we see a majority of the cost revenues come from the even from the prepayment of around RMB730 million. So like to know, when this right down will be right back in the future and any policy regarding that? And also I'd like to know this cash cost or other cash cost? Thank you.
Quanfu Hong: So, basically the inventory write-down will be based on the future sales. Actually right now, we are more optimistic about the future sales and that means the situation will be obviously more optic then the previous write-down.So, at end of each quarter, we will reevaluate the write-down based on the miner sales factory.
Unidentified Analyst: So such change regarding the sales and also the demand towards the Martinez which is expanding the upcoming of the high workup maybe that from historical, the miner we have prepared some machines before the high work period. So get to the preparation of this half year high yield period. So I would like to know what is this year’s conditions that regarding that? I think there'll be a starting side of current situation. Thank you.
Nangeng Zhang: So, basically, the coronavirus affected minor stock up on mining equipment for the rainy season, and in February we know that the coronavirus outbreak has affected the delivery and also logistics. But in March and April, all is back to normal including logistics and also the manufacturers of the Bitcoin miner. And we are very confident actually for the rainy season. First of all, more and more miner ready for the rainy season, that’s first.And second, we know that many miners willing to prepare miners to for the upcoming rainy season. And except for only sole miners, we also have mew business model. This year, we have released a new model, which is rent the miners. The mine equipment of miners, this will help our cash flow.And also we are pretty confident [indiscernible] including also having in may over the Bitcoin would bring our company opportunities. And one more thing is about the old miners, I mean all generations of mining equipment, many miners they have the demand to replace their old generation mining equipments to newly ones. So, I think basically we think it’s an opportunity for company. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: So my last question is regarding the AI chips. So as I mentioned that you saw concern of the AI product in the future but you know the percentage that AI product of the total revenues in the last fourth quarter and also I’d like to know what is management estimate or outlook for AI chips revenue percentages in this year? Thank you.
Quanfu Hong: Okay. So, for year 2019, the sales for the AI chip is RMB2.7 million, and for 2020 actually, we don’t think the revenue is being most important part. The most important part is that we now already cooperate with many top players in the AI industry. And our mission has not being changed which is, we hope that the AI revenue in the next three years will payout significant part of our revenue structure. And right now in different areas like the smart control and agriculture and industry, we already collaborated with many major companies. So, we basically are very confident in the future market for AI Chip. Thank you so much.
