"Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the VPG First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Cantor, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Steven Cantor: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to VPG's 2021 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our Q1 press release and accompanying slides have been posted on VPG's website, vpgsensors.com. An audio recording of today's call will be available on the Internet for a limited time and can also be accessed on our website. Today's remarks are governed by the safe harbor provisions of the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Our actual results may vary from forward-looking statements. For a discussion of the risks associated with VPG's operations, we encourage you to refer to our SEC filings, especially the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our other recent SEC filings.
Ziv Shoshani: Thank you, Steve. I will begin with some commentary on VPG's consolidated financial results and sales trends for the first quarter. Bill will provide financial details and our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. Moving to Slide 3, first quarter highlights. The first quarter results marked a good start to the year. We achieved sales of $70.6 million, which was slightly above the high end of our guidance. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.21 as we grew our orders 22% sequentially to $85.5 million, reflecting strength across our businesses and end markets. Advanced sensor reported another strong quarter and continued to broaden its customer pipeline. We executed well operationally, growing our gross margin and achieving an adjusted operating margin of 8.7% and adjusted EPS of $0.31, which were within our target model. Moving to Slide 4, consolidated results and market trends. Looking at the first quarter sales results in more detail. Sales grew 4.3% from a year ago and declined 6.4% from the fourth quarter. Sequentially, business trends were generally positive, and we ended the first quarter with a book-to-bill above 1.1 in all the 3 reporting segments. In each of our end markets, we had the book-to-bill above 1, with the exception of the avionic, military and space market. In the test and measurement market, sales grew 8.3%. Demand in this market grew 41.1% sequentially, driven by continued strength related to semiconductor test equipment. Sales sequentially to the industrial weighing transportation and general industrial end markets grew 2.7%, 7.2% and 3.7%, respectively. Other trends reflected strength in the transportation market, which grew 29.4%. In the avionic, military and space and steel markets, in which our sales are driven by the timing of customer projects, sales were softer, as we communicated last quarter. However, orders in the steel market grew 59.1% sequentially, reflecting increased customer activity and improved project-driven demand. Orders in avionic, military and space, or AMS, grew 13.1%. While sales in our other markets were essentially flat, orders grew 23.5% sequentially, driven by strong demand in consumer, medical, construction and precision ag. The net result of these trends was a book-to-bill of 1.21 for the first quarter and a backlog of $100.7 million.
Bill Clancy: Thanks, Ziv. Referring to Page 7 of the slide deck, in the first quarter of 2021, we achieved revenues of $70.6 million, gross profit of $28.6 million or 40.5% of sales, operating income of $6.4 million or 9.1% of revenues and net earnings per diluted share of $0.36. On an adjusted basis, which we lay out in our reconciliation table in the press release, our gross profit was $28.6 million or 40.5% of sales, operating income was $6.1 million or 8.7% of sales and net earnings per diluted share was $0.31. Our first quarter 2021 revenues declined 6.4% compared to $75.4 million in the fourth quarter and were 4.3% above the first quarter a year ago. Foreign exchange for the first quarter of 2021 had a positive effect on revenues by $2.1 million compared to a year ago and $700,000 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Operator:  The first question comes from Dick Ryan of Colliers.
Dick Ryan: Good job on the gross margins. What -- I think in the fourth quarter, you talked about some increased logistic costs. Did you see any more supply chain constraints leading to higher costs? Or what's your view of the supply chain? And how should we look for gross margins for the next couple of quarters?
Ziv Shoshani: Okay. Dick, regarding the logistics cost, as we have indicated in the last quarter, there is an increase in logistics cost due to limited air and sea capacity. We have not seen further increases as of last quarter. Therefore, at this point in time, we should expect to see a continuation of the cost, and we don't expect any increase. What we had -- maybe an item that should be indicated, we had -- on the gross profit side, we are looking at -- as we indicated, at a favorable impact of approximately $800,000, coming as a onetime effect related to an inventory adjustment in Q1, which should not repeat itself. In addition to that, we -- as we are going to expand our Chinese facility in order to support further demand for Force Sensors, we should expect to see slightly higher cost since our China cost -- our labor cost in China is higher than India. And in addition to that, the fact that we would expand the Chinese facility will also imply that we will incur tariff cost as we are going to export those products to the United States. So all in all, for the second quarter -- if we are looking at the second quarter, based on the guidance, we are looking at the gross profit margin to be flat in respect to Q1, given the onetime effect and the higher labor cost in China, including the tariff cost.
Dick Ryan: I appreciate that color. So Ziv, what's -- you indicated your India facility was up and running, and you can hear some of the horror stories how COVID is spreading over there. What are you guys seeing? And has there been any impact? Or do you anticipate any impact -- revenue impact from that facility?
Ziv Shoshani: Okay. At this point in time, there was -- in the state where we are, there was -- the government has announced a lockdown for 2 weeks, until May 24. VPG has been classified already a year ago as an essential business due to the fact that we are selling to the medical and agricultural market. Therefore, we have a special waiver to continue and operate our facilities during those lockdown. I'm -- we are much, much better prepared in India than a year ago. Since we were in a shutdown situation a year ago, we have all the proper protections in place already in India for our own employees. So I have to say, given the environment, the company is much, much better prepared to protect its employees in addition to the waiver that we have received. Therefore, at this point in time, we are fully operational and we have not -- and we -- and at this point, we are not expecting any interruption in manufacturing for our India facility.
Dick Ryan: Okay. So the expansion in China, will that -- I mean, where will that feed product to? Is that to just augment what India is producing? Or is the demand not strong?
Ziv Shoshani: This is correct. We have several product lines as the book-to-bill for Force Sensors continues to be strong. We have added capacity in India. And at the same time, we are increasing the capacity in China, mostly for weighing application. So this is correct. This is augmenting the India facility and increasing the capacity in order to support the demand, the current demand.
Dick Ryan: Great. Congratulations on the strong execution.
Ziv Shoshani: Thank you.
Operator:  The next question is from Sarkis Sherbetchyan of B. Riley Securities.
Sarkis Sherbetchyan: Ziv, you mentioned advanced sensors demand remains strong. I think you said in the prepared comments, 80% year-on-year growth and that's supporting a level approaching $40 million in sales annualized. Just wanted to kind of see if you can maybe discuss the comments on broadening the customer base for the product and across end markets. Any color that you can share with us there?
Ziv Shoshani: Okay. Regarding advanced sensors, so you -- as you indicated, revenue has increased by 80.7% year-over-year and 4.5% sequentially since we are running really at the maximum capacity. At the same time, I have to say that given the strict nondisclosure agreements we have with most of our customers, I cannot comment on the specific customers. However, we will -- we have continued to broaden the customer base. Among this, we were pleased to add more significant customers. But unfortunately, I will not be able to provide more details. But I would like to say that regarding the transition, we are on time and the fact that once we would finalize the transition in Q3, it's not only that we will be fully operational in the new facility, but also at the same time we are adding more capacity. So once we complete the transition, we would be able to support much higher volume and as it seems -- given the strong environment, it seems that this capacity will be required and will be fully operational this year.
Sarkis Sherbetchyan: I guess just to poke around a little bit more. On this annualized sales level or number for this particular product line, is it 1 or 2 specific customers that you can't talk about? Or is there a particular segments that you're serving? That's pretty exciting, I guess. As I look at the revenue by market on Slide 4 of the presentation, the other markets are growing much more rapidly year-on-year. I'm assuming advanced sensors falls into, I guess, broadly speaking, that category regarding growth. Can you kind of help me out there?
Ziv Shoshani: You are correct, Sarkis. And part of the segments that we -- that I will not be able to provide more color is mostly regarding medical, consumer and -- mainly around medical and consumer. To some extent, we have some specific test and measurement customers who had some highly proprietary, I would say, applications, but those are the type of end markets. But you are correct. The other markets, some -- the growth in the other markets falls also under the advanced sensors product line.
Sarkis Sherbetchyan: Okay. And I guess if I kind of think about your guidance, clearly, I think it's fairly strong and nice sequential growth. Anything that you can share regarding just kind of the end market health real-time that you're either excited about or worried about that we should be mindful of?
Ziv Shoshani: Well, we have seen, I would say, a rebound pretty much in all end markets. The ones which we have seen some good indications and I did provide more details regarding the book-to-bill, is the steel-related product lines like KELK and DSI. Over there, we have seen a more modest increase in demand. We are still expecting or looking for a much stronger rebound. But in terms of all the other markets, test and measurements, AMS, industrial weighing, general industrial, we have seen a rebound of demand. And at this point in time, we still believe that there is much more room to grow from a demand standpoint. We do provide competitive lead time in all our product lines. We are not on allocations. Therefore, we do believe that once the demand would increase, we would be able to deliver higher revenues.
Sarkis Sherbetchyan: Got it. Just one last one for me. Is the first quarter SG&A level kind of the right number to think about going forward on a run rate basis? I guess what's kind of the baseline going forward? And if there were any onetime things to consider as we look at the sequential trends of OpEx?
Bill Clancy: Yes. Sarkis, from the SG&A perspective, I mean the run rate -- or the actual that you saw in Q1 obviously, now, in 2021 has like the wage increases that I mentioned. There is, obviously, FX, fringe adjustments. What we have recorded is probably the base number. I mean, obviously, as we roll out the year, we always look at and review our accruals in the second half of the year. But as far our base, what we have recorded so far in Q1 would be a good measure for Q2.
Sarkis Sherbetchyan: Okay. Got it. And does this assume the facility for FTP and advanced sensors, kind of, the costs are essentially kind of being realized today? Or do we have some more to think about as that facility comes online and is more fully realized in, I think, you mentioned in the third quarter of this year?
Ziv Shoshani: Most of the cost has been realized. Since we are already running in the facility, we may expect an incremental cost of some additional overhead supporting a larger operation at the level of $100,000 to $200,000 a quarter. But by far, most of the cost has been realized. The only thing which should be indicated is that we have booked so far in Q1, $130,000 of start-up costs. But since the transition has not been completed, we should expect to book further start-up costs until the transition is completed by the end of Q3. But those are onetime. Those has nothing to do with the ongoing cost to support the new facility.
Operator:  The next question is from Bill Dezellem of Tieton Capital.
Bill Dezellem: You had referenced in your remarks, interest in acquisitions and have historically been active there. Does the rebound in economy, does that make acquisitions either any more difficult or easier to consummate? Or does it not have an impact at all in terms of ability to get deals done?
Ziv Shoshani: Regarding the M&A landscape, we have seen -- and it has been published. The last few transactions of large companies, like Abaco Systems, by National Instruments and MTS, those has been finalized at the level of 16, 17x EBITDA. I think that's one of the challenges that the M&A landscape has that debt or cash is fairly cheap and that the interest rates are extremely low. Therefore, companies or transactions are completed at a much higher multiple than they have been a while ago. We still believe as a company that, despite this environment, we would -- we are looking and having always dialogues with specific companies we are -- as we have been for quite -- for all along, very, very disciplined in respect to the valuation, return on investment, IRR targets that the company has to achieve while completing an acquisition. And we still believe that despite this environment, there are still opportunities. Unfortunately, I have nothing to report at this point in time, but we are in constant dialogues with companies. And hopefully, we would be able to complete an acquisition. But at this point in time, I have nothing to report. But it's very high on our radar screen, on our mission to complete an acquisition given our strong balance sheet.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Cantor for closing remarks.
Steven Cantor: Thank you. Before we close, I want to let everyone know, we will be presenting at the Needham Conference on May 17 and also the Stifel Conference on June 10. Please see our website for more details. Thank you again for joining our call, and have a good day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
