"Operator: Thank you for joining Cutera's Fourth 2020 Earnings Conference Call. After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. The discussion today includes forward looking statements. These forward looking statements reflect management's current forecast or expectation of certain aspects of the company's future business, including, but not limited to any financial guidance provided for modeling purposes. Forward-looking statements are based on current information that is, by its nature, dynamic and subject to change. Forward- looking statements include, among others, statements regarding financial guidance, regulatory approvals, productivity improvements and plans to introduce new products and expand into additional geographies.
Dave Mowry: Thank you, operator. Today, I'm joined on the call by Jason Ritchie, President and Chief Operating Officer, as well as Rohan Seth, our Chief Financial Officer. I will begin today's call by providing a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 business results. Jason will then provide operational highlights and commercial updates on the business and then turn the call over to Rohan who will provide more detail around our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as the near-term outlook. Before opening the call to questions I will then highlight progress on our long-term initiatives. Now I'd like to turn to the fourth quarter highlights. I am pleased with our overall performance during the fourth quarter of 2020. While the COVID pandemic continued to impact our end markets particularly on the capital equipment side of the business. We continued to execute our plans and made significant sequential improvement in both our top line and bottom line performances. As I have discussed in the past I am very proud of the way the entire Cutera team has responded to the challenges presented by COVID-19 to us and to the market in whole.
Jason Richey: Thanks Dave. 2020 introduced many challenges and forced our team to evolve our ways of doing business on multiple levels. As we move into 2021, I think we've set a solid benchmark for our team to improve upon as markets continue to recover through the year. In North America our fourth quarter sequential improvement was driven by the continued improvement in rep productivity. This is encouraging given the challenges that of the present selling environment and the necessity to continuously evolve our methods in this ever changing landscape. Through the calendar year we've developed new processes and created a foundation that I feel will facilitate the scaling of our business going forward. As we head into 2021 we intend to continue driving sales expansion by adding additional high quality sales reps while sharpening our efforts to generate high quality customer leads to fuel the growth. We are also continuing to invest resource into our capital sales training program to accelerate the uptake of new reps and hone the skills of recent addition. We expect these improvements will help drive results in the back half of 2021 as customer appetite for capital continues to recover. Internationally our capital business underperformed versus prior year due to significant COVID headwinds in the EU and several distributor markets. In regards to the EU we commenced a restructuring within our sales force namely in Southern Europe as we improved our talent pool and consolidate sales leadership roles to improve efficiencies across the region. Additionally, we have improved our connectivity and tracking to duplicate many of the changes we made in the UK earlier which have already begun to bear fruit. We are optimistic we will achieve a similar result in other key geographies within the EU over the course of 2021.
Rohan Seth: Thank you Jason. As I review my prepared remarks I want to clarify that I will be sharing both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics as relevant. A complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the earnings release. We encourage listeners and readers to review our non-GAAP metrics in conjunction with the GAAP results as contained in our learning release. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $49.9 million compared to $51.8 million for the same period in 2019 representing a decline of approximately 4%. The decline is solely attributed to reduced treatment volumes and lower levels of capital equipment purchases due to COVID disruptions. For the full year revenue was $147.7 million compared to $181.7 million in 2019. Fourth quarter North American capital equipment revenue was $18.4 million compared to $28.5 million for the same period last year, while international capital equipment revenue for the fourth quarter was $11.7 million a 4% decline. The declines in our European and distributed driven businesses were offset by gains in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. For the full year 2020 North American capital equipment revenue was $50.7 million compared to $96.7 million in 2019. Full year international capital equipment was $40 million compared to $43.8 million in 2019. I am especially pleased to report that recurring revenue defined as consumables, global service and skincare revenue was $19.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $11 million for the same period last year, representing an 80% growth over prior year. For the full year recurring revenue was $56.9 million compared to $41.2 million in 2019. GAAP gross profit for fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was $28.1 million representing a 60 basis point gross margin improvement compared to the same period last year. The negative impact of our mix shift was offset by increased savings in our manufacturing and service operations. GAAP gross profit for 2020 was $75.8 million a 22.8% decline compared to 2019. Total GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $26.6 million compared to $30.7 million for the same period last year, a 13% decrease that allowed us to deliver improved leverage. Our results reflect the strong efforts made by our team to drive operational discipline and rigor in our day-to-day operations. Operating expenses for the full year 2020 were $98.6 million compared to $110.2 million in 2019. Sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $14.7 million compared to $20.3 million for the same period last year. Lower expenses were primarily the result of lower commission due to lower sales and process adjustments to our sales and marketing activities such as shifting from live to online events. While we do expect that some of these expenses may come back as COVID related restrictions ease we are confident that many of the changes implemented during 2020 will be more permanent in nature and allow us to have more efficient sales and marketing spending as we return to a more normalized environment. Sales and marketing expense for the full year 2020 was $52.8 million compared to $71.1 million in 2019. R&D expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $4 million compared to $4.5 million for the same period last year. R&D expense for the full year 2020 was $14.3 million compared to $15.1 million in 2019. Finally G&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $7.9 million compared to $5.9 million in the same period last year driven by legal fees and settlements for the effort of resolving cases as well as increased bad debts. G&A expense for the full year 2020 was $31.5 million compared to $24 million in 2019. 2020 proved to be a very challenging environment which showed up in costs such as bad debts, legal expenses and in the fees associated with an interim CFO; all of which broke the growth of our G&A expense. Looking into 2021 we expect these items to moderate and though there may be some lumpiness we do not view this increase as recurring in nature. For the fourth quarter of 2020 our non-GAAP operating income also known as adjusted EBITDA was a profit of $4.7 million compared to a profit of $2.1 million for the same period last year due to lower operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2020 was a loss of $4.8 million compared to a gain of $4.3 million in 2019. There were no material or significant changes to our tax position. However, as part of our ongoing year-end processes we did have a one-time true-up of certain tax provisions. Turning now to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $47 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable investments compared to $33.9 million at the same time last year and $42.4 million at the end of third quarter 2020. We ended the quarter with $28.5 million of inventory down $0.8 million from the third quarter as we continued our effort to monetize our inventory through the end of 2020. I'm very pleased to report that the goals we outlined in at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic continue to bear fruit. We continue to be diligent in our tax management and retain strength in our balance sheet to continue to fund our upcoming growth investment. Lastly, turning to guidance. Given the continued uncertainty surrounding magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the wide range of outcomes for its impact on both capital sales and procedure volumes over the course of the year we will not be providing formal guidance at this time. However, we are providing the following direction commentary to help our investors think about the drivers of our performance in 2021. We expect that capital equipment sales will continue to be driven by our true sculpt body sculpting platforms, Truesculpt flex and Truesculpt ID as well as the Secret PRO micro-needling products. While we expect our first half sales to be driven by recurring revenue we anticipate a continued recovery in our capital equipment field both in the U.S. and internationally particularly as we move into the second half of the year. We are remaining measured in our outlook for the year for a number of reasons including the unknown impact of newer more contagious variants of the Corona virus as well as the yet to be seen rollout vaccines and their impact on consumer behavior as we move through this year. We expect recurring revenues to continue growing at a healthy clip throughout the year driven by our skincare line and the continued expansion of our products that come attached to the consumable. At the gross margin line we expect continued improvements in full year 2021 driven by the natural expansion of margins as our capital equipment returns to more normal levels driving cost absorption of a smaller manufacturing cost base. We expect continued discipline at the operating expense line in 2021 with continued leverage on general and administrative costs. However, please note that we will be making meaningful investments this year ahead of the launch of our acne products which will cause increased spending in research and development and to a lesser extent sales and marketing as we move throughout the year. For cash flows we expect to be neutral or better on an adjusted EBITDA basis. With that I will now pass it back to Dave for closing remarks.
Dave Mowry: Thank you Rohan. Before opening up for Q&A I would like to provide a brief progress report reviewing the strides we've made against our key initiatives. Six quarters ago upon joining Cutera we turned our attention to building a plan to unlock value and create sustainability. I shared our approach shortly after my arrival and stated that Cutera was an execution story in the making. Our plan required that we set the foundation from which we could build the future Cutera a foundation or phase one required that we tackle three key elements. Number one, improve the reliability of performance at Cutera by increasing the mix of contribution coming from recurring revenue categories and deliver strong consistent results. Number two, shift the balance of our resource investments to fund game-changing differentiated products and programs aligned to our core customers and third, align our business to clear financial performance standards to include achieving sustained profitability executing on our vital few initiatives that serve our focus and accelerating the transformation of our business. Regarding our goal of improving the reliability of our revenue performance we focused on closing the gap to a more balanced split of recurring to capital revenue aiming for a 50/50 mix. Over the last 18 months we've taken and held the position that all new products must have a consumable stream. We've committed commercial resources specifically to accelerating each of our recurring revenue streams and providing better service and support to our customers inclusive of local promotional marketing procedures, helping practices better position Cutera treatment and improving regional support for skincare including promotional products directly to patients. Over the past six quarters we've been able to increase the percentage of recurring revenue over total revenue from the low 20s in the second quarter of 2019 to the upper 30s entering 2021. On our second element of the plan shifting our investment strategy we've made some critical internal investment decisions in the back half of 2019 to allocate more resources to higher impact programs specifically targeting unmet clinical needs of our core customers. We began and have continued to allocate greater than one third of our R&D spend to these first mover type product development programs. Despite financial pressures of a market uniquely challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic we held fast to our belief in these critical investments and in doing so unleashed a remarkable group of scientists, engineers and designers that embrace the challenge of changing the way energy-based aesthetics is delivered. First and most meaningful of the products coming through this high impact product pipeline will be our solution to acne. Our prioritization strategy accelerated the development process and aligned our organization around a product which we believe will provide practitioners with a durable solution to acne without the side effects associated with current pharma solutions. Finally, is the third element of our foundation and that is developing a culture of financial rigor and a pathway to sustain profitability. We have made significant progress overall on improving the financial performance of the business during the last six quarters. By narrowing our focus and ensuring alignment of the various functional areas to a single set of vital few initiatives we have reduced redundancy, eliminated distractions and streamlined our business. One recognized benefit of focus is our ability to move key programs and projects faster and more efficiently. This includes our gross margin expansion programs which has already removed considerable cost from the fixed overhead pool and is actively carving costs out of material, labor and warranty expenses. Our right-sizing activities executed during the COVID pandemic were done in a strategic manner. We identified the removed operating expenses from non-essential functions by consolidating roles and releasing redundant positions. Concurrently, we identified key processes to improve within sales and marketing as well as G&A to provide additional near-term savings while creating the scalability we need for our future. The impact of our improvements provide durable improvement to the P&L while enabling the company to generate cash in the third quarter aside from one-time adjustments and generated approximately 4.5 million in cash in the fourth quarter irrespective of any adjustment. I believe that 2021 will be a bit of a transition year as we close out the phase one programs I just spoke of and start to identify and initiate some of the phase 2 projects that will lead us to the future. While phase 1 was a return to basic blocking and tackling phase 2 will be a much more exciting time marked by notable product launches and commercial expansions that deliver growth. As we embark on the next segment of our journey I am extremely thankful for the hard work and dedication shown by the entire Cutera team to get us where we are today ahead of plan. From the challenges we have faced and overcome we emerged a stronger and more focused organization with momentum from our fourth quarters’ performance. I could not be more fired up moving into 2021 knowing that we are better positioned as a company, fully aligned to the critical tasks ahead and highly motivated as a team to continue our journey towards realizing our vision of creating the future of medical aesthetics. With that I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator? 
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of John Glass with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
John Glass:  Thanks guys. Good afternoon. Maybe what I'll do is I'll zoom in first and then I'll sort of zoom out to wrap up the questions. The first one Dave, last quarter you said hey the new baseline for skincare and that was around 7 million and obviously a really big quarter here in 4Q. So how do we think about this going forward is 10 million the new base? It's a big number but you did mention the success call it the contribution of new accounts as well as utilization of current accounts. I just want a little bit more color and how we think about that going forward.
Dave Mowry: John, thanks for the question. I think we've continued to be quite excited about the skincare line and how that's continued to grow. I do believe that there was some artificial inflation from fourth quarter just due to some timing associated with an anticipation of price increases or what have you that I think our customers anticipated but obviously was not rolled out. So I do think there was a little bit of a pull into fourth quarter just naturally from customer behavior. I do believe that the base that I spoke of earlier of $7 million and $7.5 million is still the base that we expect and anticipate for this business going into 2021 and I think there will be some lumpiness from time to time as people anticipate pricing increases or there is some stocking of new customers or expansion of customers but I think what I spoke of I think is really I think where I'd like to kind of believe that the baseline is going forward.
John Glass: Got it. Perfect. And then just to shift over to gross margins and Rohan maybe this one's for you but they were really good in the quarter again non-GAAP sort of around that 56% to 57% in the back half of 2020. I think in your commentary you talked about gross margins up I believe year-over-year but if we just even isolate more of that normalized 2H environment, can the gross margins sustain at that level into ‘21 even if skincare acts a bit as a mixed headwind and then I've got one more.
Rohan Seth: Yes. So great question and thanks for that. So look, we've taken some really significant actions in the middle of the pandemic and significantly right-sized our fixed cost base. We do expect these gains to be very durable in nature as you rightly pointed out our margin this quarter actually grew in spite of lower sales and mixed headwind. I would expect our margin to ramp up and continue to ramp up as volumes come back online. Our expectation would be to get to the lower 60s as we exit the year and this further growth in our margin will be driven by continued right sizing in our services business. Our long-term target for margin continues to be in the mid 60s.
John Glass: Wow. Great. Great numbers and then I said I'll zoom out, so there just getting some questions and I guess. I've got questions as well just that  million in the fourth quarter around capital how normalized was the environment? I get it it's sort of unfair to ask normalize in a COVID environment but I look to your 4Q to 1Q and past non-COVID years and capital sometimes down 25% plus sequentially was that $30 million real? Do you think it's real and is that sort of the right jump off point into 1Q as much granularity as you're willing to give. Thank you.
Dave Mowry: Yes. Well, that's a multi-faceted question John because we had a number of different variables that we were working through. I think it's a great question though. So let me kind of take you through a few components. Obviously as we had indicated we expected some sequential growth as we started to make investments in our sales force in North America in particular. I think we continued upgrades and talent during the quarter and we saw a great lift from their capabilities and their productivity. That said we do believe we still have a number of positions to fill for North America and it takes a time once you fill those positions for those people to make contributions as they build their deal pipelines. So I think that from a headcount perspective you're probably kind of thinking about it from a normalized perspective 4Q to 1Q similar. I think the ups and downs of shutdowns, restrictions, etc. were very mixed from a regional perspective and we all know that elected procedures fell off for certain markets. We didn't see a whole lot of elective or fall off in treatment volumes but certainly we were fighting very-very difficult, very kind of toe to toe if you will for deals and trying to find our way to as many deals as we possibly could find in the quarter. So I think from that perspective it's probably going to be similar quarter-to-quarter growth change 4Q to 1Q. I think the one thing that may be working in our favor is the vaccines and the optimism if you will that's out there that the cure if you will is just around the corner and that's rolling out and I do think that has opened the doors and created a little bit of excitement or momentum for the buying customers around capital which might be slightly improved from Q4 to Q1. However, I still think that we've got a lot of uphill work to do there. So I don't know if those three elements help you kind of bracket what we think around the first quarter but I'd say it's mostly simple seasonal 4Q to 1Q with maybe a little bit of additional optimism from vaccine.
John Glass: That's great color. Thanks guys.
Dave Mowry: All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.
Matthew O’Brien: Thank you. Afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple for me. First one with a couple of parts here but just to follow up on John's question on the skincare business, Dave are you seeing any other pull through in those accounts outside of just the traditional skincare products? Are you getting them to buy other technologies and as far as the Japan but and then secondly as you look at the U.S. on the consumable side and you kind of talked about some of the strength that you're seeing there overall just talk about what you're seeing there and how durable is zoom faced in this phenomenon and the rest of the consumable component to the business as we look into’ 21?
Dave Mowry: Well, first of all Matt, I have to give you credit. I haven't heard the coin phase of the coin zoomed face but I will probably start stealing that shamelessly. In terms of your first question skincare and the durability and the pull through from it like we said there is some account expansion and there is also penetration which makes it in our minds a durable business and one that's probably less susceptible to kind of shrink back or creep. But by the same token we don't necessarily see it as a significant contributor to pull through. It does get us into new accounts. It does allow us to expand our base of sales or distribution of that product. However, in many cases those are not necessarily transferring to capital purchases or in any way shape or form right now. We do believe that over a longer term period that may be the case but certainly not the current case. As we think, a little bit more about the zoom face phenomenon and what we think will continue there we do think that there's probably a higher degree of facial rejuvenation programs that are going to play out over the first part of 2021 but as I said we remain exceptionally bullish on the true body and the body contouring lines coming back as people get more freedom, more independence and lower restrictions we know that folks have been waiting long for summer vacations. We think as people have greater social interactions and in many cases start returning to work on some basis a few days a week or what have you I think they're going to feel the need to kind of lose the couch potato attitude and kind of adopt a little bit more of a healthy look and feel and I think that's going to drive a little bit more volume into the body contouring procedures. So at least that's our insight talking with our customers and understanding what they're seeing and hearing. So I believe that that's fairly well calibrated.
Matthew O’Brien: Got it. Okay. And then flipping over to phase two Dave, I know it sounds like with these investments here in R&D on the acne side this year makes sense that this is still probably more of a development type of year for acne but I think Rohan mentioned some dozen marketing investments this year. So I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves with any of this but it feels like acne is something that could roll out in ‘22. Is that the right way to think about it? And then just talk maybe a little bit more about the confidence that you've seen over the last couple months in that program?
Dave Mowry: Yes Matt I appreciate the question. We have not, we've decided to kind of sit on our hands a little bit in terms of what we release. We know that there's some competitive product out there and we don't intend to do anything to give them any advantage that we've been able to gain through our own learning. So we've been kind of sitting back a little bit and not providing as much data and I appreciate the investors patience with us as we move through that. That being said our bullishness for the product its ability to treat and solve the medical condition known as acne and it has been remarkable and we have not come off that position. I think from a timing perspective we'll get into a position maybe later in the first half or early second half of the year where we can announce a little bit more around the timing and provide a little more insight to the results we're seeing and why we're so bullish on this technology. Those things said we do believe that this is a transformative product for the company and we also believe that there are some things that we can do behind this that will also maybe not be quite the same market size but would be of interest and significance in helping us continue to transform this company from a fast follower to a first mover and I couldn't be more proud of our R&D team, the scientists, the engineers, the designers over there and the clinicians that are helping us drive these programs.
Matthew O’Brien: Very fair. Thank you so much.
Dave Mowry: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Cooley with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.
Chris Cooley: Good evening everyone and congrats on a great fourth quarter. Just quickly for me if I could, if we think a little bit about how the cadences that go through the year and the initiatives that you already have in place, you started upgrading the sales force in the third quarter and then expanded it further in the fourth quarter. How do we think about those sales force expansion initiatives, the marketing nuances there for the capital side as you start to face some competition from other indications which are out there in the first half? We all know we have cellulite treatments coming out which are pretty well heralded as well as some wrinkle therapies. Just kind of curious kind of how you are looking at addressing kind of the finite demand for incremental capital during the first half of the year. And I've got a follow-up.
Dave Mowry: Yes Chris that's a great question. First of all thanks for the compliment. We certainly appreciate that regarding the fourth quarter results. In terms of your question and there is no doubt that the competition for wallet share is continuing to kind of grow and expand if you will and we're well aware of the technologies that are out there. I think our view in these markets is that we believe that we've been somewhat constrained by our own staff as the markets have been somewhat limited but as the markets continue to open up we will continue to add reps and expand our footprint and we believe that there is plenty of room for that to happen and grow. That said we do believe that the 2021 is probably more of a back half story on capital and capital equipment growth. We think that we'll be kind of modulated a little bit on the first half of the year as these new reps come up to speed, build their deal pipeline and then kind of learn the processes and gain some efficiency and productivity. We do believe though in the first half of the year it'll be a little bit more of a recurring revenue growth story and something that I think could be a positive contributor to kind of get us to the second half. So I think we're well aware of the competition. We understand what's out there. We understand fighting for wallet share but we also know that we have a very differentiated and very complete product portfolio that allows us to be engaged in almost any deal going on anywhere and we believe that that portfolio is really what allows our reps to have access to almost any deal that's available. We also know that we've been able to command our ASP and get into deals because of the quality of our product, the flexibility and the broad breadth of capabilities our products have and we'll continue to leverage that as new markets, new people come to the market we know that we're a known entity. We have good product, reliable, robust capabilities and we'll continue to ride that on our legacy lines.
Chris Cooley: Great. I appreciate all that color and then maybe just a quick clarifying question from me when you look down to the P&L really strong results, the only place that I guess a little bit surprising to the downside was on the service component and especially with capital being more in line with our expectations in the quarter. Just curious if you could provide any color there about what you saw in the fourth quarter as it pertains to the service line item there specifically with the consumables.
Dave Mowry: Yes. There is a couple of elements to that on the service side. The first element I would share with you is first of all I think we saw a very strong service line comparative last year with some distributor sales as distributors typically stock up on parts, service parts at the end of the year and many of our distributors as you can tell from the market have not been as active in selling products this year or many of those markets have suffered through restrictions. I think secondly we had some restrictions that were kind of come and go, catch can if you will within some of the different territories and I think that was also somewhat restrictive as well. So we were not disappointed at all frankly in our service performance. We were actually pretty pleased that we were able to kind of pull it together with the restrictions that they faced on both travel and access to accounts.
Chris Cooley: That's great. And if I could just squeeze one last one and I'll get back in queue maybe a quick one for Rohan. Great second half cash flow improvement sequentially there driven by the leverage in the P&L. So just kind of curious I realize it's going to be lumpy as we go through the first half of the year it sounds like from an R&D spin perspective and some other items but should we anticipate continued sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA or cash flow as we think about the business going forward or is it more skewed in the second half of the year as you will start to get some leverage with stronger capital sales? Thanks so much.
Rohan Seth: Yes. Look, no, I appreciate the question and look at as you may have noted we've chosen not to guide. The one thing I will reiterate is that we do expect to be cash EBITDA neutral or better for the year. We will continue to manage our P&L as responsibly as we can while keeping our eye on growth investments to drive our future.
Chris Cooley: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti from Maxim Group. Please proceed with your questions.
Anthony Vendetti: Thanks. Yes, most of my questions been answered but just in terms of the capital equipment products that are driving growth now I know True Body, True Sculpt is one of your main products and as you mentioned facial rejuvenation right now. Is do you still one of the main product in terms of capital equipment sales and then if you could also comment on Excel V just in terms of where those products and in terms of contribution to revenues and go forward?
Dave Mowry: Yes. We don't break those out specifically but let me give you a little bit of color Anthony. From our perspective  and Excel V are core products. They are part of our legacy products but they're also high performing and on the higher volume side of the legacy laser products that we offer. We've seen a pickup just because of the facial rejuvenation, the facial programs that are going on at our customers accounts and we've also seen that the Excel V because it's a workhorse product for a lot of our  core customers if you will we've seen kind of a refreshing of that and that comes from a couple things. We've done some upgrades to that product portfolio over the last couple years and our Excel V is really I think a top line probably the highest performer, best performing product within the vascular laser offerings that are out there in the field and we believe people are seeing the value that it creates. On the Zio side there's a great deal of flexibility that that offers. So new practices or expansion of practices and are great applications for bringing Zio into to a practice into the clinic if you will and both of those have been, I think a higher percentage sales in 2020 just because of the nature of procedures and focus on facial rejuvenation or facial procedures.
Anthony Vendetti: Okay. That's very helpful Dave and then maybe just on the obviously skincare and you went through the rationale behind that outperformance this quarter but that in the revenue line it's the handpiece refills and skincare. In terms of handpiece refills that used to be for the Titan product. Is there anything else in there and is the number for the fourth quarter 90% plus skincare or how should we look at that?
Dave Mowry: Yes. The vast majority of that number I'm even hedging when I say that I would say that this is really a skincare number as reported by skincare. It comes out of Japan and really the growth is all from that product. The Titan replacements on a per year-over-year basis are probably declining slightly if you will as new technology is out there and available into the marketplace. So as new regulatory approvals are gained that will continue to decline and we'll see pick up elsewhere within the products and systems if you will but that's a skincare number and that's the predominant growth contributor.
Anthony Vendetti: Okay and then just the last question on the skincare line. The gross margin on that is that stable? Is there room for improvement there or is the gross margin improvement that Rohan mentioned and the goal is that going to be driven by new products which have to meet a certain threshold in order to be released?
Dave Mowry: Yes. I would tell you that we have a contract in place that gives us assurance and support and it's good for both of us and the manufacturer of the product. We've fortified that relationship and will continue to do so but I believe that skincare will continue to be a slight drag on margins and probably more so as we continue to grow and leverage the overhead absorption that we'll see with higher volumes next year. That said we're very happy with that line and very happy with the contributions it makes overall and is there opportunity for improvement? I would say the opportunity for improvement is probably more within our own products and the things that we can control. So I'm not anticipating a significant contribution in margin from the skincare. Frankly, I'm just looking to be able to manage it, maintain it and not have further declines from it.
Anthony Vendetti: Okay very helpful.
Dave Mowry: If I could Anthony, I'm sorry, I really I meant to say one more thing. I don't think it will prevent us from achieving our goal either and that's probably I think that the point I think is important to make is we've targeted low to mid 60s gross margin for this business and as we've modeled this we don't believe this will block us from achieving that goal.
Anthony Vendetti: Okay. Excellent. Thanks. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sidoti with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your questions.
Jim Sidoti: Hi good afternoon. Can you hear me? 
Dave Mowry: We can Jim. How are you? 
Jim Sidoti: I'm well. Glad to it sounds like everybody's doing well there. Glad to hear everybody's healthy. Two questions. One, if you look at system sales down 35% in North America but only down 4% in the rest of the world, can you just give us a little more color why that is?
Dave Mowry: Yes. I think it's a great question. I think first of all it's a little bit of the log numbers. We had very small numbers in a few countries that were able to really outperform. So I think that's part of the story here Jim. Australia, New Zealand and Japan which have undergone significant makeovers in terms of the talent and the capabilities within those two regions. We're still in process of doing those type of upgrades here in the U.S. and I will tell you through the course of COVID we've had the opportunity to make over a significant portion of the sales organization in North America and I believe they'll continue to improve, grow, stretch and we'll be able to add and scale this business. So I don't believe that's a long term issue for us but I think it's a certainly a focus area for us to continue to accelerate that recovery so and I think if you look back on Q3 and look back on Q, earlier periods if you will within the year. I think what you'll see is that some areas were less impacted by COVID and other areas were more impacted similar to like the intercontinental region and even Europe had more significant impact from COVID than some of the Asian direct markets that we play in. Those things said, I also will tell you that I think the North American market is a competitive market. We've seen an increase in competitive nature of certain deals. I think what is compelling and what gives me great optimism is the fact that we've been able to hold price and win the majority of the deals that we're in. So while I think more deals are competitive I do think that we've got a good product portfolio and a good positioning if you will that allows us the kind of the view that we'll win more as we go forward.
Jim Sidoti: And so for Australia, New Zealand and Japan, did you say you added distribution or did you change to a new distributor there? 
Dave Mowry: No. We made these investments a couple years ago and what we're seeing play out here is the quality of the that leadership that we put in place and the quality of talent that they've developed and continue to kind of invest in.
Jim Sidoti: Okay. Thanks. And then the second question, I know you're hesitant to give guidance I don't blame you but you did make a comment about R&D spending going up I think for the acne development. Can you just give us some sense on what that means? Is that a clinical trial? Is that still in the development stage, regulatory approval costs? Can you just give us a little more color what that is and maybe some magnitude?
Dave Mowry: Yes. I'll give you some color as to the elements and maybe Rohan can give you some magnitude but I don't think it's huge amounts but from my perspective to make it to the finish line here not only in North America but across the globe we've got to obviously achieve the regulatory approvals that we need within those regions. This is really a medical condition Jim and I think as such the FDA has appropriately asked for appropriate data and support in kind of giving a regulatory approval. We believe those same approvals are going to be necessary in other regions in terms of CE Mark as well as approvals in major markets that we play in such as Japan and Korea and Asia which are large and very predominant acne markets that we want to make sure we continue to access. So as we look forward we got clinical work to do. We're going to have a rollout if you will that's going to be responsible for developing the right data which is inclusive of additional clinical trials not just for regulatory approval but to understand applications and how to best train, teach and deliver the knowledge needed to work this device effectively and get the outcomes that we know can be delivered. So there's a lot that's going on from that perspective across R&D from prototype builds to clinical data collection to presenting and being able to kind of have a scientific dissemination plan that's worthy of the size of market that this would address. Rohan you want to give some just color on benchmarking the size?
Rohan Seth: Yes. So like Dave mentioned there's some build out on the R&D front and depending on where we are in commercialization there could be some spending on the sales and marketing side and a very light amount of spending on the manufacturing side as well and we expect that to be in the range of 3 million to 4 million for the year all in.
Jim Sidoti: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Dave Mowry: Great. Operator I don't think there is any more calls in the queue. I just wanted to thank everyone for their attendance and attention on this earnings call. I think we've done a good job of executing on our game plan and we're exceptionally excited going into 2021 knowing the momentum that we've built. Well, we look forward to updating you in future calls and giving you insight to the company's performance and along the way executing our plan and continue to realize our vision of creating the future of medical aesthetics. Thank you."
