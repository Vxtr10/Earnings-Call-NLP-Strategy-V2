"Operator: Good morning. I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations, and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.
Robert J. Marshall: Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Jim Crines. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.
David C. Dvorak: Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the second quarter of 2014. This morning, I'll review our second quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress to date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms and all earnings results on an adjusted basis. In the second quarter, Zimmer recorded solid sales gains across various categories of our differentiated portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions, most notably in key overseas markets. Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.18 billion, an increase of 0.9%. And our earnings per share were $1.49, an increase of 4.2% over the prior year period. In the second quarter, Americas sales declined by 2.7% year-over-year, while Europe, Middle East and Africa increased by 4.9%, and the Asia Pacific region grew 6.9%. I'd like to remind you that these results include the consolidated impact of 1 less billing day in the quarter. We sustained healthy traction overseas, inclusive of strong performances in key emerging markets. In the second half of the year, we'll heighten our focus on improving U.S. performance by leveraging our comprehensive portfolio of clinically proven solutions, as well as our robust pipeline of new and recently commercialized products. Those familiar with Zimmer's value creation framework will know that we're dedicated to consistently creating and returning value for our stockholders. In keeping with that strategy, Zimmer once again delivered against our financial commitments in the second quarter of 2014, while increasing the quarterly dividend and expanding operating margins relative to the prior year period. Our operational excellence programs also continued to drive disciplined expense management as highlighted by the ongoing successes from our strategic sourcing initiatives. And as part of Zimmer's ongoing commitment to quality improvement, we continue to fund enhancements of all aspects of our quality management system. As we've communicated in previous quarters, this focused work will continue as part of our quality and operational excellence agenda. Before discussing our results in greater detail, I'd like to first comment on market and pricing conditions. In the second quarter, underlying global market dynamics were stable and generally consistent with sequential seasonality experienced in previous operating periods. Turning to pricing, Zimmer experienced a price decline of 2.8% in the quarter, which was in line with expectations coming into the year. The sequential movement from the first quarter of 2014 was largely attributable to the anticipated biannual Japanese price adjustment. Turning now to our business units. Knee sales for the second quarter increased 3.5%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 7.3% and negative price of 3.8%. Our Americas segment reported a sales increase of 0.5%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa grew by an impressive 9.4%. And the Asia Pacific region delivered 5.3% growth compared to the prior year period. Our strong results in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region were supported by new market introductions of Persona, the personalized knee system, which continues to gain commercial traction and competitive conversion at a premium price point across the globe. We've also been extremely pleased with the notable overseas performance of our market-leading, clinically proven NexGen knee replacement system. In addition, Zimmer continued to leverage our intelligent instrumentation portfolio in the second quarter, including the iASSIST Personalized Guidance System, Patient Specific Instruments and our digital templating solutions. These advanced offerings are designed to enhance intraoperative precision and efficiency, while delivering ongoing economic and operational benefits to orthopedic service lines. Lastly, our early intervention portfolio continued to achieve sales growth and increase adoption, in line with our expectations. The performance of these products, most notably Gel-One and Subchondroplasty, continue to validate our investments into early stage intervention and joint preservation. Zimmer's hip business grew sales by 0.4% in the second quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.4% and negative price of 3.0%. These results include a 1.9% sales decrease in the Americas; a sales decrease of 0.8% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and an impressive 7.8% sales increase in the Asia Pacific region. Our strong performance in the Asia Pacific region was led by the M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis with Kinectiv Technology, the Continuum Acetabular System and BIOLOX delta Ceramic heads. We believe that the ongoing contribution of these and other premium constructs will create additional growth opportunities in future periods in part by leveraging differentiated technologies such as the Avenir hip system, VIVACIT-E advanced bearing material and the Synovasure biomarker test for periprosthetic joint infection. Zimmer's extremities business recorded growth of 5.2% in the second quarter, led by strong performances in the Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions with 19.4% and 18.0% sales growth, respectively. Despite facing challenging sales comparisons in the United States, as well as competitive product launches which drove some trialing of other systems, extremities continued to benefit from robust sales of our Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System. Together with this leading upper extremity solution, which now includes a Patient Specific Instruments platform, our recent introductions into new anatomical sites are broadening our offerings in this fast-growing category. These exciting products include our Nexel Total Elbow system, featuring VIVACIT-E and the differentiated Trabecular Metal Total Ankle system. Zimmer dental sales decreased by 1.4% in the second quarter. We experienced steady demand across our broad dental implant offerings, including the Trabecular Metal Dental Implant, and solid performances from our leading regenerative product lines. Growth of 4% in the Americas was offset by continued softened demand for premium solutions in Europe, which slowed our overall growth this quarter. However, the ongoing introduction of our P-I-branded, value-based offerings across Southern Europe tempered the impact of this market transition. Trauma sales rose 6.4% in the second quarter, with our Americas segment reporting a sales decrease of 3.6%; Europe, Middle East and Africa growing sales by 14.9%; and the Asia Pacific region delivering 17.9% growth. Our impressive results overseas were driven by strong performances across all major market segments, led by the Zimmer Natural Nail family, NCB Periprosthetic Plating System and the XtraFix External Fixation System. As we look to future quarters, we'll remain focused on the commercialization of strategic portfolio additions, including the existing launch of the Zimmer Distal Radius Plating System, a versatile trauma system with comprehensive instrumentation designed to conform to a broad range of patient anatomy. Zimmer spine sales decreased by 4.4% from the prior year period. This business continues to expand its diversified portfolio, and in the second quarter, bolstered its core fusion offerings with the 510(k) clearances and commercial launches of the Optio-C interior cervical system and the Virage OCT spinal fixation system, both of which have experienced promising early results. Combined with solid performances in key Asia Pacific and European markets, we believe that Zimmer spine is well positioned for growth in the second half of 2014. Turning to our surgical and other category. Zimmer posted a sales decline of 9.9% for the quarter. It's worth noting that after normalizing our results to account for the exceptional performance in the capital sales of our differentiated Transposal fluid waste management system in the prior year, our surgical business continued to post solid results. Sales of both the Transposal system and its higher-margin consumables have remained in line with our execution plan. Our overall results were also bolstered by strong sales of the A.T.S. family of automated tourniquet systems, surgical consumable products and surgical power equipment, highlighted by our Universal Power System surgical instruments. As we look to the rest of the year, we'll continue to leverage this differentiated portfolio for improved growth. Before I close, I'd like to now make some comments about our planned combination with Biomet. As we communicated in April, this transaction will enhance our position in the $45 billion musculoskeletal industry. It will also allow us to offer a broader, more comprehensive portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions across the continuum of care, with both cross-selling opportunities and a revenue mix that is more diversified and predictable. In the weeks following our April announcement, we finalized important financing details of this $13.35 billion acquisition and met a number of key integration planning milestones to finish the quarter on track and on schedule with the process of closing this transaction. Having worked closely with the leadership of Biomet over the course of the second quarter, we've gained invaluable exposure to their highly talented and committed business teams. This experience has heightened our confidence in the value we'll be able to create and deliver as a combined entity. Concerning the ongoing antitrust review of the proposed merger with Biomet, as we announced earlier this month, we received the second request from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. We're in the process of complying with the request and will continue to work closely with the FTC as it conducts its review of the proposed transaction. With regard to the review in Europe, we've been providing requested information to the European Commission and plan to file the merger notification in the near term. We continue to expect the transaction to be clear and remain confident in our anticipated timeline to complete this combination during the first quarter of 2015. With that, I'll now ask Jim to provide further details on the second quarter and our updated guidance. Jim?
James T. Crines: Thanks, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our updated 2014 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,183,000,000, a 0.9% constant currency increase compared to the second quarter of 2013. As David noted in his comments, we had approximately 1 less billing day in the quarter on a consolidated basis. Underlying growth rates would be approximately 1% higher on a consolidated basis and nearly 1.5% higher in the Americas. Net currency impact for the quarter increased revenues by 0.2% or $2 million. The positive currency impact for the quarter related principally to our euro-denominated revenues, partially offset by negative currency translation associated with our Japanese yen and Australian dollar base revenues. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 72.6% for the quarter. The margin ratio declined 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2013. In the second quarter, we recognized approximately 70 basis points of charges related to the medical device excise tax. Increased pressure from price, coupled with the recognition of negative manufacturing variances associated with our quality and operational excellence programs, were partially offset by ongoing benefits from our cash flow hedging program and reduced year-over-year excess and obsolescence charges. The company's R&D expense decreased 12.6% or $7 million to 4.1% of net sales when compared to the prior year. The decrease in R&D expense continues to reflect focused efforts on our quality and operational excellence initiatives and related dedication of resources. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $456 million in the second quarter, and at 38.5% of sales, were 70 basis points below the prior year. The improved ratio reflects the ongoing benefits from our operational excellence programs, including, among other things, strategic sourcing of indirect supplies and services, as well as the establishment of shared services, leveraged across multiple reporting units. In the quarter, the company reported pretax charges of $64.7 million in special items; $9.6 million in cost of products sold pertaining to global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives and recent acquisitions; and $10 million of interest and financing costs associated with the pending Biomet transaction. Adjusted second quarter 2014 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which include $55.4 million related to quality and operational excellence, initiatives to manufacturing logistics and sales; and $28.9 million in integration and other costs. Additionally, in the quarter, we increased our provision for certain claims related to the Durom Acetabular Component by $21.8 million before taxes. This reflects an increase in the total estimated viability for projected worldwide claims related to Durom, offset by anticipated insurance recoveries. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $355.4 million. At 30%, our adjusted operating profit-to-sales ratio was 50 basis points higher than the prior year second quarter. The continued expansion of operating margin reflects our ongoing financial commitment to our stockholders through disciplined execution of our growth and operational excellence, goals and objectives. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $12.9 million, which was favorable when compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $254.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 4.6% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 4.2% to $1.49 on a 171 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $1.03, reported diluted earnings per share increased 15.7% from the prior year second quarter reported EPS of $0.89. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.8%, which is 60 basis points favorable when compared to prior year due to higher mix of earnings from lower tax jurisdictions. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, as the majority of restructuring and other special items charges are incurred in higher tax jurisdictions. The company had approximately 168.8 million shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2014, an increase over the 167.8 million as of March 31, 2013. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $254.1 million, an increase of 34% from $189.7 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase is driven primarily by favorable accounts receivable trends in our Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segments and lower tax payments relative to the same period prior year. Net inventories were $1,147,000,000 at the end of the second quarter, an increase of $21.3 million from March 31, 2014. The increase is due primarily to the support of ongoing global commercialization of new product offerings, as well as the effects of going through a direct sales model in certain Eastern European markets. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 304 days, an increase of 20 days as compared to the prior year same quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, net receivables increased to $950 million from $943 million in the second quarter of 2013 or 1% over prior year. Our adjusted traded cash receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 69 days, flat when compared with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $91.3 million. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $159.5 million, $51 million higher than the second quarter of 2013. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant and equipment. The significant increase in free cash flow was driven by increased operating cash flows, while still supporting the ongoing launch of new products through rolling instrument deployments. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $94.6 million, including $62.6 million for instruments and $32 million for property, plant and equipment. I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2014. In our earnings release this morning, we updated the company's expectation for full year 2014 revenues and now forecast revenues to increase between 2% and 3% constant currency when compared to 2013. We continue to expect foreign currency translation to decrease our reported 2014 revenues by approximately 0.5% for the full year. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be between 1.5% and 2.5% above 2013 results. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to increase between 2% and 2.5% constant currency and between 2.5% and 3% on a reported basis when compared to the prior year. We expect to recognize gains on hedge contracts in the second half and continue to see positive comparisons related to inventory obsolescence charges and manufacturing variances. Consequently, our guidance for the gross margin ratio for the year remains unchanged and is expected to be between 73% and 74%. Our guidance for R&D, SG&A and interest expense for the full year remains unchanged. However, as you refine your models for the third and fourth quarters, please consider that seasonally higher ratios typically experienced in the third quarter. We expect our SG&A ratio in the third quarter to be in a range of 40.5% to 41%, while R&D expenses as a percentage of sales is likely to be at or near 4.5% for the quarter. Moving down the income statement, the estimated full year tax rate remains at 25.5%. The previously guided fully diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares is now expected to be in a range of 172 million to 173 million shares, due to higher expected employee stock option exercises. Full year 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance has been updated to be within a range of $6 to $6.10, taking into account our updated expectations for full year revenue growth, as well as a slight increase in the fully diluted share count. As indicated in our earnings release, to arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for special items and certain claims of $250 million and $70 million of Biomet transaction-related expenses on a pretax basis or approximately $1.35 per share. Taking into account the seasonality associated with the third quarter and other factors, third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.29 to $1.31. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from any unforeseen events. David, I'll turn the call back over to you.
David C. Dvorak: Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, Zimmer achieved solid sales across a number of product categories and geographic regions that are vital to our growth plan. We're also able to return significant value to our stockholders by successfully executing on the ongoing commercialization of new clinically relevant product offerings, realizing the benefits of our operational excellence agenda and demonstrating prudent stewardship for capital. As I mentioned earlier, we're very excited about our planned combination with Biomet. By leveraging the best of both companies, our combined entity will possess an organizational talent advantage that will distinguish us in our industry. Our vision for this combination is to enhance our position as a leading musculoskeletal innovator, identifying new growth opportunities through a number of attractive portfolio additions and shaping future solutions for the evolving healthcare industry. And now I'd like to ask Regina to begin the Q&A portion of our call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.
Matthew Taylor: I just wanted to ask 1 on the deal here. So first of all, can you update us as to whether there's been any change in your views of the net synergies or where they may be coming from with regards to the transaction? And then also, wanted to ask if you could provide any more color on what these subsequent requests have been about and why you're still confident in the timing?
David C. Dvorak: Yes, on the first part, Matt, there hasn't been a change in the view of our net synergies. We're developing the detailed plans, and we're very confident in what we expressed at the point of the initial announcement of the combination. With respect to the regulatory process as well, the analysis that was the basis for our decision to move forward remains very much in line with what we're experiencing. We see this as being an aspect of the process that is absolutely manageable. We're confident that we're going to get the transaction cleared and look to consummate the combination in the first quarter of 2015. So everything on both fronts is tracking very consistent with the analysis that led to the execution and announcement of the deal in the first instance.
Matthew Taylor: And then you called out pricing in your comments certainly in line with the guidance for the year, but towards the higher end. I guess, number one, why did you feel like you needed to explicitly call that out? And are there any other areas of weakness or strength over the next several periods that you would note from a pricing or mix perspective that could change that dynamic?
David C. Dvorak: Yes, I think that the dynamics have been pretty consistent. As we've said, we're very transparent and provide a fair amount of granularity on the pricing every quarter, Matt. And as we said, the sequential decline from about 2.3% to 2.8% in our case was principally driven by the biannual adjustment that was anticipated in Japan that came in within a range of what was expected. So we're right about at the midpoint of what we guided to back in January. Our expectation was for the full year on price, which was a range of minus 2% to minus 3%. And I think that probably in the short term, commercial execution of new product launches and taking advantage of the mix opportunities are the area for us to focus on to offset some of the price pressure. But again, the price pressure has been pretty consistent.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of William Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity.
William J. Plovanic: Just on the acquisition, one thing I'd like to ask is how were you thinking about the peripheral businesses and the disruptions in those channels? As we look at what's going on in knees and hips, you said you'll keep that distribution in place, but how should we think about the peripheral businesses?
David C. Dvorak: Yes, we're going to put plans together that are directed and focused on unique aspects of each of those businesses. It's the case as we've had discussions with people that some of the fear around the distribution channel, I think, is more premised upon what one has seen through combinations outside of the large joints side. And so we need to learn from those lessons, both ones that we'd experienced in the past, as well as ones that others have experienced. I think the historic track record on the large joints side is quite good on combining the distribution channels and retaining the momentum of the businesses. So we're going to look at developing these plans unique for each of those business units, and we'll take a bit different approach as necessary and as is consistent with our longer-term vision as to how we want those channels to be structured to make sure that we're growing at or above market in each product category in each of the geographic segments.
William J. Plovanic: Okay. And then just on the trends in the business in general. We've seen you're the fourth player to report thus far. It seems like Q1 was slow. It was weather and maybe back-end loading due to ACA. As Q2 rolls out, it looks like it's not coming back to the length that we had thought it would. Do you think there's a different type of seasonality in the market today? Do you think the market maybe is slowing a bit? How should we think about this?
David C. Dvorak: Yes, I don't think that the market is slowing. I think that the market is in a range of something that should properly be characterized as stable, certainly across the global markets, that's the case. Within the United States, which has obviously been the area of a lot of focus coming out of the fourth quarter 2013 with the uptick that we saw, I do think that you're going to see some shift in seasonality. We clearly saw that as far as a percentage of revenues for the total year that were generated in Q4. That was a bit of an outlier. And I do think that you're going to see some of that shift be retained in 2014. It's a bit of a question as to how much or whether or not that trend will even continue further, but it was something that we saw in the fourth quarter. As you look at the sequential patterns from Q1 to Q2 in 2014, they're actually pretty consistent with historic trends. So again, on a global basis, this is a stable market. And I think that as we get into the second half, we'll all gain insight as to how much of that seasonality shift is permanent, whether or not that's going to continue as an expanded trend.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert A. Hopkins: So first question is really on the performance in the quarter and then a little bit on the guidance. So I'd love to ask you to comment on a couple things. One, just broadly, why are you lowering the revenue guidance? What's going on in the business that was different than you thought 30 days ago? And also, Jim, if you could comment on why gross margins were weak this quarter relative -- especially relative to Q1. I'm just trying to understand that a little bit better. And then, finally, to get it all in, in one thing, on the selling day issue, not to nitpick, but last quarter, you said you had an extra half day, now it's an extra full day. I just wanted to kind of reconcile that.
David C. Dvorak: Yes. On the last of those, I think we said we had an extra half day in the first quarter. What we said in Q2, Bob, was that we had 1 less billing day, okay. So with respect to the guidance, a lot of that is just math relative to where we've been for the first half of the year. We came in with the midpoint of 4%. We're now revising to 2.5%. A lot of that is just the reality of the U.S. performance in Q2 and the consolidated results in Q2 and what it would take to do performance-wise in the second half of the year to push up towards that midpoint of 4%. So we're guiding at 2% to 3%. And if one does the math, there's obviously some sequential improvement in growth rates that is embedded in the potential for that guidance for the second half of the year. But it's another quarter of insight. Some of that is market, but I think we've got some work to do, frankly, in the United States to fully exploit the opportunities that we have with the new product introductions. In the second quarter, we did a better job of exploiting those opportunities outside the United States as is evidenced by, for instance, the strong performance in knees within the Europe, Middle East and Africa geographic segments and the strong performance in hips within the Asia Pacific region. So the portfolio is there, and we're going to redouble our efforts to focus on taking advantage of what the market gives us in the United States in the second half of the year and hope that we generate some positive trends in our performance sequentially into Q3 and Q4. You want to grab the margin question?
James T. Crines: Sure. Bob, this is Jim. Just on the gross margin question, we guided coming into the year a gross margin ratio at 73% to 74%. We're still guiding to that same range. So we had good visibility coming into the year as to what the opportunity would be on gross margin and, frankly, still have good visibility to how we're going to achieve that. In the second half, as I indicated, the lower anticipated manufacturing variance is really the principal difference in getting from kind of where we are in the second quarter to where we expect to be in the second half of the year. There's also some differences, some favorability and hedge gains second half relative to the first half. But I would tell you, the more significant contributor to the difference in gross margin ratios between both the first and second quarters, as well as the step-up from second quarter into the second half, have to do with manufacturing variances. And those are largely connected with the operational and quality excellence initiatives that we have underway. Those variances -- negative variances were largely incurred in the second half of last year, that's why we had good visibility as to how they were going to impact on this year. Those are largely amortized off now through the first half of the year. And we have visibility now to the actual variances that were incurred in the first half that will impact on the second half and why we feel confident in the step-up we're anticipating in the second half of the year relative to the second quarter.
Robert A. Hopkins: And then on the Americas business, is that a little early Biomet disruption, you think? Or is there something else going on?
David C. Dvorak: I don't at all believe that. If you look at the announcement date, we announced the transaction and our entering the agreement for the transaction on the 24th of April. And so you essentially had 2 months. And we're just not seeing signs of that, Bob. I think that this is for us to improve our performance relative to the opportunity we have with the product bag and the new product introductions. And so, as I said, big area of focus for us in the second half of the year.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.
Derrick Sung: Question. Just a follow-up on the performance in Americas. Is the launch of the Persona knee -- I know there were higher expectations for that or relatively high expectations for that going to the year, and that was going to be a big growth driver. Is that one of the areas that you're looking to improve upon or maybe the one area that isn't quite meeting your expectations versus what you thought about going into the year? And then last -- on the call last quarter, you talked about your expectations that the combined Zimmer-Biomet organization would be able to grow sort of revenues at market post integration, including kind of any sort of revenue dis-synergies. Is that still your view, given kind of your new outlook on your business? Or has that changed also?
David C. Dvorak: Sure, Derrick. The launch of Persona continues to be a success story for us. We've got some other categories in some of the legacy knee business that we need to improve our performance upon, but we're tracking in a consistent manner with expectations on the capability to take that system into competitive accounts and not only get trialing but convert business. So the promise of Persona is unchanged relative to the prior conversations and discussions we've had. And as far as the go-forward view as to -- on a combined basis, we absolutely believe that we're going to be able to, in the initial stages, grow the combined business at market. And obviously, as we complete the integration post-closing in the quarters, an operating period or 2 thereafter, we would expect to accelerate above market growth rates within the musculoskeletal industry.
Derrick Sung: Okay. And on the deal, now that you've had a chance to look more deeply kind of into the financial aspects of it, et cetera, are there any tax opportunities that maybe you didn't call out on -- when you announced the deal that might be available? I'm thinking in terms of perhaps intercompany loans or any sort of rationalization or optimization of the manufacturing footprint that might leave any tax opportunities in the integrated business?
James T. Crines: Derrick, this is Jim. I think it's fair to assume that we have teams that are very focused and working with outside subject matter experts kind of helping us identify where those opportunities are to either drive a lower effective tax rate for the combined entity going forward and/or just as importantly, determine how we might be able to get access to the cash that's going to be accumulating offshore connected with the businesses overseas and the revenues and profits that are being generated overseas. And so there's a real focus on it, a dedicated effort. Smart people with a lot of expertise that are going to continue to work the issues and determine how we can optimize both the effective tax rate, as well as our -- the opportunity to access the cash flow that's going to be -- or the cash that's going to be accumulating offshore. But beyond that, I'm not -- we're not at a stage where we could provide any more specific guidance.
Derrick Sung: Okay. And if I could just slip one quick one in. Could you give us a sense for the contribution of Gel-One this quarter in the early intervention portfolio? You mentioned it was kind of tracking few expectations. I think a couple quarters ago, we were kind of in that $5 million to $10 million range. And maybe give us a sense for where we are with that launch.
James T. Crines: Yes, we continue to pick up share with that product really, frankly, very pleased with the progress that we're making. There's more opportunity in front of us, and that team is focused on taking full advantage of those opportunities to get that product listed on formularies where it's not currently listed on formularies, just as 1 example. I don't want to and we don't want to get into providing brand sales information on these calls. We have hundreds of brands, Derrick. So I know as much as you're interested in for the tracking how that particular one is doing, I'm not going to provide any more specific information than that.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Capital.
Richard Newitter: I was just hoping just going back to the lowered top line guidance, David, if you could maybe talk a little bit about how much -- I appreciate maybe you're revising it to see what happened, play out in the second quarter. But how much of the step-down can you attribute specifically to kind of a change in your view of the pricing kind of environment and what you saw in 2Q in the first half versus kind of volumes? Can you maybe parse that out a little bit?
David C. Dvorak: Yes, I wouldn't say that any significant portion of it is based upon a revised view of pricing. Again, if you go back to the January call, we provided some specific visibility to what we're anticipating for the year, and that was a range of negative 2% to negative 3%. We're bang on in the middle of that halfway through the year. So that really doesn't impact our go-forward view. So you pull that out to volume and mix, and both of those are highly related to our commercial execution. And coming out of Q2 here that we're going to focus on, obviously, for improvement in the United States commercial execution.
Richard Newitter: Okay. And then just kind of adding onto an earlier question that was asked. With respect to kind of the longer-term outlook post the Biomet deal, assuming it goes through on time, as you think it will, the question I have is does the -- perhaps a slightly lowered growth rate for some of your core recon businesses heading into that transaction impact what you think the kind of top line dis-synergy impact could be and how that impacts the potential for the cost synergies to offset that and lead to your net synergy number? Or is all of that fully intact and you feel confident that you can regain through execution whatever, perhaps, you didn't do as well as you wanted to do in 2Q?
David C. Dvorak: Yes, we're confident. We're confident. We've got all the necessary ingredients, talent in the field, the right product offerings, a whole variety of terrific new products and innovative solutions that either are launched or are in the process of being launched. So we're going to be in good shape as we consummate the combination and move forward. And I think that the other side, on the Biomet side, they're doing good work and continuing their strong momentum. So our goal is, obviously, independent of one another, to maintain the momentum so that we hit that start line and -- with good boat's feet. And I think that I'm very confident at this point that we're going to be able to achieve that objective and then take it forward from there.
Richard Newitter: And just one last one, on the competitive trialing that you called out in the shoulder arena, can you just describe kind of what you're hearing? And is this -- are they generally coming back to you? Or what's the feedback then? Do you feel confident that that's transient?
David C. Dvorak: Well, I think that there are just a lot of new systems and the number of players within that space has broadened in a pretty significant way over the course of the last operating period or 2. So we've enjoyed a nice position historically within that market. And we have some important new innovations, including the PSI offering for upper extremities. We continue to drive nice gains and growth with our Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder. And suffice it to say that we have some other things in the pipeline that are going to help us ensure that the trialing doesn't become a permanent conversion in the go-forward quarters, okay.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
Michael N. Weinstein: I wanted to follow up a couple of items. First, I want to follow up Bob's question just on the gross margins. Jim, you talked about the benefit of your hedging program. It showed up a little bit this quarter. It sounds like it'll be there in the back half of the year. Could you quantify what impact that will have in the back half of the year? And then as those hedges roll over, does that become a headwind for 2015? How should we think about that?
James T. Crines: I guess if you look at the year-to-year comparisons, Mike, it's a modest improvement year-to-year. But in absolute terms, it's probably somewhere in the range of 40 -- short of 40 basis points in terms of contribution in each of those quarters, in Q3 and Q4. And yes, going into next year, and we know, with the hedging program, what it does is provides protection for an operating period or sometimes a little more than an operating period. And we have that much time to get whatever sort of things we need to get in place, whether it's adjustments in pricing or reductions in standard costs to offset whatever decline we might otherwise see in gross margins as a consequence of currency changes. So it's only a headwind to the extent that we don't offset it with cost savings and/or price changes. And then as I pointed out to Bob, you understand as well, I think everybody understands, the headwind associated with the medical device tax in this year's numbers, which will not have, obviously, going into next year because it'll be fully -- obviously, fully reflected in the margin as we get through the end of this year.
Michael N. Weinstein: Let me shift gears, and I know you mentioned some of this earlier, but I just want to understand the strategy around distribution, particularly in U.S., the 2 U.S. recon sales force. So it sounds like, David, the plan for now is to try and keep everybody in place for some period of time post-closing. Can you just help us understand, one, the cost of a program like that? I know we've seen it in other companies. So how much will you invest in order to retain distribution for some period of time? And then two, how long do you think that period of time is? Is there a point which, is it year 2 in which we would expect to see greater integration of the U.S. distribution system?
David C. Dvorak: Yes, I think I would tell you that from a starting point, we've made the statements and commitments to retain all of the sales positions for both entities. And that's really important because from our perspective, we're going to have a broader set of solutions and offerings in order to fully leverage the cross-selling opportunities that come with this combination. We're going to need all of that sales talent, and there's a pretty extraordinary level of sales talent in both sides of these organizations. So the design of that distribution channel, all of that work is in process at this point in time, with the leadership teams having been established. And in the coming weeks, months, they're going to continue to make good progress on that front, but it's premised upon retaining the sales positions and fully leveraging all of the products and solutions the combined entity will possess. So that is the fundamental value creator from the company's perspective on a combined basis. It's also the primary value creator from the customers' standpoint, and will align the sales folks' opportunity to do really well economically in accordance with achieving the objective and realizing the full potential.
Michael N. Weinstein: So I'm sorry, but coming back to the question, do you know what the cost will be of retention? So you're going to put a retention program in place. Do you have at this point an estimate what that cost would be? Is that something that is in the P&L? Or is that something that is outside the P&L, Jim?
James T. Crines: Yes, Mike, this is Jim. As we indicated when we made the announcement, we anticipate spending somewhere in the range -- somewhere in the order of $400 million on costs to integrate. So that would -- within it, would be an estimate of what we expect to spend on both retention and integration. And it would be separated out, if you will, excluded to arrive at our cash earnings measure.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
Lawrence Biegelsen: I just wanted to come back to the assumption for the Biomet deal. So how should we think about the accretion from the Biomet deal in the first year? Is it still the $1.15 to $1.25? And how should we think about the base EPS that's offered for 2015? The midpoint of your EPS guidance for this year is about 5%. So how should we think about kind of the underlying EPS growth for '15? And then I have a follow-up.
James T. Crines: No change in the expectations with respect to year 1 accretion, so still in a range of $1.15 to $1.25. As you pointed out, midpoint of our guidance for 2014 EPS on an adjusted basis is $6.05. And we haven't, at this stage, obviously, given guidance for 2015 EPS for Zimmer on a standalone basis. So you'll have to make whatever assumptions you feel sort of appropriate with respect to what kind of growth. We're going to continue to run the business, and we would certainly continue to run the business the way we have been over the past number of years, driving leverage, earnings growth off of the top line opportunity that still view to be somewhere in the range of low to mid-single digits. So that hopefully provides you with at least a little bit of direction on how to think about the expectation that we have for the combined entity for 2015.
Lawrence Biegelsen: That's very helpful. And I just wanted to come back to pricing. If we take a step back and we look at the pricing trends for you and your competitors in hips and knees over the past few years, it looks like there has been a degradation in pricing from about 2% in 2011, 2.5% in 2012 and '13, and about 3% or so this -- thus far in '14. Is that a fair assessment of the pricing environment? And can you -- Jim, in the past, you've talked about kind of pricing pressure going forward and this kind of reversion to the mean, if you will. Where are we in that process? And what can you tell us to give us confidence that we won't see further degradation, let's say, over the next year or so?
James T. Crines: Sure. Well, as we've talked about over the past couple of operating periods, we continue to experience some pressure, particularly at the high end of our price curves. And particularly in the U.S. market, which has traditionally, just in terms of healthcare service providers, has been a somewhat fragmented market. It's becoming a lot less fragmented, obviously, with hospitals consolidating, large integrated networks coming together and doing their purchasing across those entire networks. That will continue, but we have been able to provide very clear guidance on what our expectations are. That guidance really hasn't changed. It's been typically in that range of around minus 2%, minus 3%. We do know, with respect to the consolidated sort of outlook and we'll again provide some guidance when we get to that point with respect to 2015. But at least in 2015, we will again anniversary out of the Japan biennial price cuts. So that'll provide at least a bit of a tailwind as we get into the back half of 2015. It's hard to say sort of exactly when we would expect to see those pricing trends, particularly within the U.S. market, begin to stabilize. But the strategies that we're developing and the tactics that'll be deployed within the U.S. market will certainly be directed at bringing more stability, if you will, particularly as we provide concessions to account at the higher end of the curve.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
Jonathan Demchick: This is actually Jon Demchick for David. I know it's been covered a bit on the call, but I wanted to try and jive some of the comments about seasonality and then also sales guidance. I mean, it sounded like you guys weren't expecting a change in the seasonal trends, which push sales higher in the back half. But it looks as though when you adjust for the day, growth is expected to be organically stable in the back half relative to the first half. Are there any specific headwinds that you expect in the second half offsetting the increased seasonality that we typically expect? I mean, it sounded like pricing wasn't necessarily the culprit here.
David C. Dvorak: No, there aren't. I think that the toughest thing to predict is off of last year's uptick, how much of that seasonality shift that we saw last year will become baked into 2014 and future periods and as a consequence, a permanent seasonality shift as opposed to more of a onetime acceleration in Q4 from 2013.
Jonathan Demchick: Very helpful. On the Biomet transaction, just had a couple quick questions. Was there any timing of expectations on complying with the second request? And then also, what was going into the $70 million of additional expenses related to Biomet? I mean, is that just financing? Or is there anything else there?
David C. Dvorak: Yes, everything that we've had by way of experience on the regulatory submission process and ultimately path towards clearance is very consistent with the due diligence that we conducted leading up to the announcement of the transaction. So nothing at all out of line with expectations, and the work streams are moving forward and the teams on both sides are being very responsive to the request. So we, again, would just express confidence that the transaction will be cleared and that from a timing standpoint, the expectation continues to be the first quarter of 2015.
James T. Crines: Yes, and just with respect to the $70 million, the majority of that is related to the financing, which covers, at this stage, both the bridge financing, as well as the bank syndication, which is done in the credit facility. As well, there's some significant fees associated with the integration planning process, which is underway, legal fees associated with the application process here in the U.S. and in Europe, as well as some financial advisory fees associated with the process we'll go through to begin to value the entity that we're acquiring. So that covers what's included in the $70 million.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.
Matthew S. Miksic: So one on just the tone and the growth that you saw in the quarter, maybe for David. Appreciate the color on the stability of the market. You mentioned you have -- I thought you said you had some work to do in the U.S. to kind of exploit the Persona launch maybe more effectively. If the market's improving sequentially here in Q2, what is it you think that created the challenge in the U.S.? And what kind of things can you do to sort of reinvigorate the growth behind that launch here in the second half? And then I have a follow-up.
David C. Dvorak: Yes, I think that what I was expressing is that the Persona launch continues on track, Matt, and consistent with our expectations. I, in response to one of the prior questions, was referencing the fact that the legacy business needs to be strengthened and our support for that business. So some of that is probably, naturally, a high level of focus and energy on the Persona launch executing well on that front and needing to ensure that at the same time, we're taking advantage of the opportunities that we have in other product categories, as well as providing a high level of attention and focus on the legacy business, including the NexGen business, importantly within the knee category. So it's blocking and tackling on the commercial execution side that is going to lead to the improvement that we look to drive in the second half of the fiscal year. And I don't think that there's anything related to the deal announcement of significance, and I don't think that there's any big unknown in relation to that. So I think we know what we need to do.
Matthew S. Miksic: So we look at these big knee system launches like Persona, it's like a 3-year, maybe a 4-year product cycle to fully kind of roll it out and execute it, and this is year 2. And just from what you're saying, it sounds like there's nothing in particular that's different about what you needed to do this year than last year. Is that fair? Is this just continued execution?
David C. Dvorak: Yes, I think that, that's right. And I think that if you look at our performance sequentially last year, it improved as the year progressed. I think that in the rhythm of the operating period, there's a little bit of a bolus of activity on the front end of the year to get the compensation plans and instrument set deployments launched that are part of the operating plan year. We've done that. We would expect to get those turns up and to start retrieve some of the benefits from those first quarter and second quarter activities and hopefully get on a track that looks a lot like the sequential improvement that we saw in the second half of 2013 within the United States. I mean, there's no doubt that we continue to track fine relative to the market, above market performance on a global basis in the knee category and likely a bit above market performance in the United States as well.
Matthew S. Miksic: And then the follow-up on the deal, the Biomet deal. I just wanted to push you a little bit on, I know that you are confident in the messaging that you're sending down to distribution. But I guess I know that this did not factor into your comments on guidance, the change in guidance. But should we not expect some distraction? Should we not expect some -- given that these are, in many cases, third-party distribution, so help me understand a little bit about how we should be thinking about the pace of the business or -- heading into that acquisition.
David C. Dvorak: Yes, I think there are always going to be dynamics that relate to the alignment in management across the different aspects of the business, Matt. And whether it's a distraction because of a big launch in a large joint category on one side or the other, or some other dynamic taking place, whether it's an internal organizational matter or something more significant like this combination. But look, winners are going to react as winners do. They're going to step up and perform in those circumstances, and we're going to see that prevail. We're going to see people that believe in the promise of this combination and the capability not only to cross-sell upon the day of closing, but the broader promise of being able to innovate in a truly differentiated way because of what this combination brings and want to be part of that. And I am absolutely confident that at the rep level and the territory leader level, we're going to put together a team of talent that is going to be unmatched in the industry. And whether or not there's some bump and grind along the way to getting there, one would expect that there would be some of that, but that's our responsibility to manage it. And again, the closer I get to the talent, I know our group and learn more about the Biomet group, I'm absolutely convinced that the capability resides within that channel. And we're going to act in a manner that's consistent with the articulation of the promise of this combination and the manner to bring that out. So we're very confident, Matt, that we're going to land in a good place. So with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8 a.m. on October 23. I'll turn the call back to you, Regina.
Operator: Thank you, again, for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
