"Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zimmer Biomet Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 7, 2022.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.
Keri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q4 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan? All right. Great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm going to just give you an outline of how we want the call to proceed this morning. I'm going to spend the first part of the discussion briefly talking about our fourth quarter results. And I'm also going to spend a little bit of time talking about what we're seeing so far in 2022. I know it's early, but I want to give you a sense of what we're seeing already and then just speak more broadly about our views of 2022 as a whole. And then I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who's going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and obviously, more detail on our guidance going forward. And then finally, it will come back to me before we move to Q&A. I just got a few things I want to close out the prepared remarks with and then we'll again jump into Q&A. Okay. So first, let's start with Q4, and I'm going to break this into really three categories. The first will be around COVID impact in Q4 and how it compared to our expectations. The second will be around VBP impact and again, how that compared to our expectations. And then finally, just performance outside of those environmental impacts and how we performed there. Okay. So let's take a step back first. I think that will help. Just when we gave our updated Q4 guidance on our Q3 earnings call back in November, we actually outlined our expectations around how COVID and staffing pressure would likely impact our fourth quarter results, and unfortunately, our assumptions largely played out in the quarter. As you probably remember, we felt that the pressure from the end of Q3 would continue into Q4. And thus, the overall pressure from COVID and staffing would actually accelerate from Q3 to Q4. And really, the big reason this played out, of course, we know now is because of the Omicron surge that occurred towards the end of the fourth quarter. And as many have already stated, a lot of that impact truly came in December itself. So what's interesting about this surge, though, is that even though the overall impact of COVID was about what we expected, the way it manifested was different, right? So ICU capacity was definitely a factor, but we did not see it as the primary driver of cancellations of procedures during the quarter. And so what we actually saw was more cancellations that occurred due to really either the patient or staffing member being diagnosed with COVID or actually having been around someone with COVID, and they were quarantining as a result and couldn't show up for the procedure. So that was really the shift that we saw in the quarter. So the overall impact was about what we expected, but the way, again, it manifested in the numbers was slightly different. Okay, so transitioning from there to VBP. Remember again on our Q3 call, we discussed what we thought the impact of China hip and knee VBP would be in our fourth quarter results. And we actually - we were largely right on how that played out. And so our expected headwind in large joints was in line with the expectations that we had and also what we communicated to you. So that was pretty much in check when we think about large joints. Now what changed during the quarter, actually even post the quarter was that on January 24, the Chinese government announced that it was formally nationalizing one of its provincial trauma VBP tenders, and that was kind of new to us. But based on that confirmation from the Chinese government and really just our knowledge of how the VBP process will work from here, we did take a sales reserve in the fourth quarter, which obviously results then in a negative Q4 impact to both our net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. And what I'd say is that even though this trauma VBP adjustment came earlier than we anticipated, it is pretty consistent with the overall scale of the impact and consistent with our expectations and what we've been talking about more recently. Now I would say looking forward, the good news is we have a lot more visibility now. We're a lot smarter on the topic, and we understand what the impact of VBP will now be on our 2022 business. And that has been included in our guidance, which Suky's going to talk about in just a minute. Okay, so now looking past VBP and COVID in the fourth quarter, I'm very proud of the team when we focus on the things we can control. ZB's business execution against a challenging backdrop has been strong. Our strength of our team right now, that kind of one ZB culture, is as evident as it's ever been, and I think more important than ever. And the team has really been able to move our strategy forward even in these challenging times. And a few proof points to be able to point at, the team was able to drive continued strong demand and momentum for ROSA. And that is globally, not just in the U.S. but globally. We actually more than doubled the number of installed ROSAs in 2021 versus our cumulative total at the end of 2020. That's a pretty significant jump up, and again, speaks to the momentum that we have in robotics and orthopedics. And those ROSAs are paying off. In the fourth quarter, those installed ROSAs allowed us to reach 10% in total knee procedure penetration in the U.S. for the first time as a company. That's a huge milestone for the organization, and it's just the beginning of this ROSA journey for us. The team also delivered a successful limited launch of the world's first and really only smart knee, the Persona iQ. Now it's early. Obviously, early days. We're in limited launch right now, as I said. But the launch trajectory feels great. The feedback is good, and we're looking forward to a full launch later this year. And then finally, and I think importantly, the team continues to execute in large joints across the board, driving again above-market performance in Q4 in the U.S. for both knees and hips versus 2019. Okay. So let's transition from Q4 and talk about what we're seeing so far in early 2022. And I'm going to speak specifically about COVID and staffing challenges. What I would tell you is that the challenges that we saw in Q4, in particular in December, are unfortunately continuing into January. And as a practice, and I think prudently so, our team is continuing to build our financial models using what I'm going to call a recency bias in those models. And as a result of that, we're expecting that December and really now January pressure in COVID and staffing will continue through Q1. So what we're basically saying is that overall, we anticipate that Q1 will likely be more pressured than Q4 was. And so what does that mean for our outlook for the full year? Again, we're going to follow that same approach. We're going to look at 2022 in a similar way, actually, in a very similar way in the way we gave guidance for Q4 of 2021. Until we see a fundamental shift in the current state and what's happening today in the environment, we are projecting that the COVID pressure will continue throughout the year and will be -- actually follow a similar peak and valley trend that we saw in 2021. As I'm sure you can appreciate, given that about 80% of our revenues come from elective procedures, ZB must be highly attuned to this topic. And trust me, we are. We're highly focused in this area, and that has been captured in our assumptions for guidance. And with that, I'm going to transition to Suky to give you again more detail on Q4 and also our 2022 guidance. Okay, Suky?
Suky Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 3 topics: first, our Q4 results, including commentary on the impact of COVID; second, how that translates into full year '22 financial guidance that we provided this morning; and third, I'll provide a brief update on our longer-term outlook. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter 2021 and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. We've also provided changes versus the fourth quarter of 2019 or prepandemic results as we feel it is an important comparison. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.04 billion, a reported decline of 2.3% and a constant currency decline of 0.8% or down 4.4% versus '19. On a consolidated basis, we were about flat through November versus 2019 and declined in December due to the Omicron variant surge. Expectations for the fourth quarter had contemplated the impact of China VBP in hip and knee, and that was largely in line with expectations. Separately, we booked the sales adjustment related to channel inventory for China VBP in trauma of approximately $30 million, triggered in part by the Chinese government's announcement relating to a national trauma VBP, which was made on January 24. This adjustment was about a 650 basis point headwind to S.E.T. category growth and about a 150 basis point drag on consolidated Q4 growth. In short, excluding the impact of the China VBP on our S.E.T. results, the quarter was generally in line with the assumptions that we provided on our third quarter call and broadly consistent with the midpoint of our implied fourth quarter guidance range. The Americas declined 1.5% in the fourth quarter, down 1.9% versus 2019, with the U.S. declining 2.3% or down 2.4 versus 2019. The impact of Omicron late in the quarter, in tandem with lingering hospital staffing challenges, drove lower regional results. EMEA grew 17.3% or down 3% versus '19. The region experienced positive growth versus '19 earlier in the quarter, but quickly decelerated with the emergence of Omicron. Lastly, Asia Pacific declined 17.5% or down 15.1% versus '19 driven primarily by price adjustments on channel inventory ahead of hip, knee and trauma VBP as well as some negative impact from a spike in COVID cases starting in December in markets like Japan and Australia. Now turning to our business category performance in the fourth quarter. The global knee business increased 0.4% or down 3.9% versus 2019 with U.S. knees declining 5.2% or 3.9% versus '19. In the quarter, China VBP had a negative impact on knee growth of about 250 basis points. Our global hip business declined 2.8% or down 6% versus '19, with U.S. hips declining 4.4% or 3% versus '19. VBP impact on hip was about 700 basis points in the quarter. Our sports, extremity and trauma category decreased 4.3% or down 6.2 versus '19. The sequential deceleration was due to a softer market due to COVID and the impact of China National VBP in trauma, as discussed earlier. Excluding the impact of trauma VBP in the quarter, S.E.T. was growing low single digits versus 2020 and about flat versus '19 on an underlying basis. The dental and spine category declined 3% or down 3.8% versus '19, with dental posting growth and spine declining primarily due to continued pressure from COVID. Finally, our other category grew 14.1% or up 1.9% versus '19. Inside this category, we saw ongoing demand for ROSA Knee as well as increased revenues from the launch of our ROSA Partial Knee and hip applications. Moving on to our P&L. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.40 compared to our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.59 in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by lower revenue, a debt extinguishment loss recognized on our bond tender offer, litigation-related charges and restructuring charges that we incurred in Q4 to continue to address pressures on revenue from COVID and the stranded costs associated with the spin. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.95 represented a decline from $2.11 in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease was primarily from lower revenues in tandem with lower gross margins due to COVID-19 and the impact of China VBP in both recon and trauma, which were partially offset by targeted reductions in SG&A and a slightly lower tax rate. In addition, FX was a modest headwind to earnings per share in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 69.1%. Fourth quarter gross margin was pressured due to lower manufacturing volumes and the impact of China VBP. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 70.7% and in line with prior commentary. Our adjusted operating expenses of $882 million declined year-over-year. Inside of that, we continue to invest in R&D and commercial infrastructure across priority areas like S.E.T., robotics and data and informatics, which are being funded by accelerated improvements in efficiency across other areas of SG&A. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 25.9%, down versus the prior year, but in line with the prior quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 14.4% in the quarter. Q4 and full year tax rates were favorable to our expectations due to some discrete onetime items in the quarter. Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $366 million, and free cash flows totaled $224 million with an ending cash and cash equivalents balance of just $480 million. We continue to make good progress on delevering the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $400 million, bringing the total debt reduction in '21 to approximately $900 million, excluding the effects of foreign currency on non-U.S. denominated debt. Moving to our financial outlook for 2022. We are issuing '22 financial guidance based on the following key assumptions. COVID and customer staffing pressures are expected to continue throughout 2022. We expect the COVID and staffing pressures that we saw in December to accelerate into the first quarter of this year with the first half of 2022 being more pressured than the second half. We do not see China VBP as a material impact to growth in '22 versus '21, but we expect variability by quarter with more pressure in the first half. Furthermore, we anticipate completing the spin of our dental and spine businesses in the near term. And as such, the guidance we are providing is only for RemainCo Zimmer Biomet. For the first quarter, ZimVie will be reported as discontinued operations, and we expect to provide pro forma 2021 information for RemainCo on or around our first quarter earnings call. While we do not have full P&L restatements available at this time, for comparison, we have provided our unaudited net sales estimate of $6.827 billion for RemainCo Zimmer Biomet. Against this backdrop, our current expectations for the full year 2022 financial outlook are reported revenue growth in the range of negative 4% to 0 versus 2021 with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 200 basis points. This translates to negative 2% to positive 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating profit margin of 26.5% to 27.5%, adjusted tax rate of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $6.80 and free cash flow of $700 million to $800 million. Inside of that guidance, we expect Q1 revenue to be flat to up slightly versus the first quarter 2021 due to headwinds from COVID and the impact of VBP being somewhat offset by the easier comp relative to the first quarter of last year and a roughly 130 basis point selling day tailwind that will largely be reversed in the fourth quarter. We expect approximately $160 million of net interest expense and approximately 212 million average shares outstanding for the year. We remain committed to our investment grade rating and expect to pay down $750 million of debt maturing in the second quarter of this year. Now turning to our longer-term outlook. With the ZimVie spin transaction nearing completion, we are also taking this opportunity to update our long-term margin expectations. Given the prolonged impact COVID-19 is having on our business, we are removing our target of at least 30% adjusted operating profit margin exiting 2023. However, we do expect to improve margins over the long term as we will continue to make targeted investments in our business to enhance top line growth while also accelerating cost savings to fund those investments. In summary, the macro environment presents challenges, but our underlying business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to execute successfully against what we can control. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Josh Jennings with Cowen.
Josh Jennings: Good morning, thanks, for taking the questions. Just wanted to start off on '22 -- 2022 revenue guidance and just make sure I understand the impact of VBP that you're baking into the range. I know you don't usually break out guidance for specific regions. But anything you can do to just help us think about what's baked in for Americas and EMEA versus Asia Pac into that down 4 to flat on a constant currency basis for 2022? And then just a follow-up on the operating margin guidance, just the trajectory. I know as these pressures are in play, you've taken another look at that in that 30% target. But just as you're moving through these transformation programs and looking at regional profitability, infrastructure in smaller markets and other areas of cost reductions, I mean, how do you balance that with the top line growth projections? Is there any risk that you're going to be impacting revenue growth over the next couple of years by pursuing these transformation programs? Thanks for taking the questions.
Bryan Hanson: Yes. Maybe I'll just start real quick on that last portion of it, and then I'll pass it over to you, Suky. We actually feel more confident in our ability to invest for growth in because of the transformation programs. The transformation programs are not specifically associated with R&D and investment in those key growth drivers for us. They're more focused on finding efficiencies that do not impact our ability to spend in those growth areas. So they really actually bring more confidence that we'll be able to spend on the things that are actually going to drive growth in the future. But outside of that, I'm going to push it over to you for the other questions.
Suky Upadhyay: Yes. So Josh, thanks for the question. Regarding revenue guidance, so we talked some of the overarching assumptions in that guide on negative 2 to 2 on an ex FX basis for the full year revenue is really around the concept of we expect COVID to continue for the full year and the impact of COVID on elective procedures and staffing shortages, again, to really be with us for the entirety of 2022. Now what we're saying is broadly, we would expect to see procedural volumes consistent with 2021. And that's in the backdrop of COVID actually accelerating in the first quarter, right, where we expect the first quarter on an underlying basis to be down. So we do expect to see some recovery in the later quarters within the year. Specifically inside of that your question to VBP, we don't see VBP as a material headwind or tailwind at this time relative to large joints or trauma, given the charges that we've taken in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now I would say that the cadence of that by quarter is going to be definitely different, even though it's not a full year headwind or tailwind. It will definitely be more pressured in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. So that's how we think about VBP. Now I think your other question was regarding how do we see regional performance in that flattish . We're not going to comment on regional color at this time. There's a lot more that's got to play out relative to COVID and the recovery by region before we're going to talk about that. So we'll give you more color as we get into the -- further into the first quarter on our first quarter call. But right now, consolidated level, we expect it at our midpoint to be about flat.
Josh Jennings: Great, Thanks for the detail.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
Vijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. My first one, Suky, is on the EPS guidance here. The base of Zimmer, right, ex the spin, I just want to make sure I have the right numbers. I'm getting to maybe something  $0.15 of earnings in 2019,  earnings on a comparable basis for last year, fiscal '21. One, can you just walk us through the bridge "
