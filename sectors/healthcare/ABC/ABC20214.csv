Today, we will focus our remarks on the exceptional progress that AmerisourceBergen team has made on our strategic priorities during fiscal 2021 and how we will capitalize on that momentum to continue executing and innovating in fiscal 2022. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of U.S. data trading generals, and verticals staff divisions in participate space. Throughout the litigation process. We have been consistent in stating our desire to addressing the enormity of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table. If the industry's proposed agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively thousands of communities across the U.S. with substantial financial support. Clearly the process is in an advanced stage, and we will not comment deeply at this time. We take our role in the supply chain seriously, and continue to work closely with stakeholders concerning these complex matters. AmerisourceBergen will continue to work diligently and alongside its partners to combat drug diversion while supporting  solutions to help the greater crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve.

We also leveraged our poll capabilities as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution and a differentiated provider of unique solutions for manufacturers globally and healthcare providers mostly.

In community pharmacy, we are particularly proud to support our Good Neighbor Pharmacy members trusted role through our innovative tools and programs, that allow independent pharmacists to optimize their operations and spend the most possible time serving their patients and communities.

Our animal health business, we support veterinary practices in similar ways to help them manage their practices as they continued experienced increased demand for their services due to growth in pet ownership. The charities role of  family, an increased importance paved upon ensuring health and well being on all family members. We also continue to differentiate ourselves as the leader in specialty distribution and commercialization services. This fiscal year we launched a variety of new services and solutions. Bolting upon our historic investments to further drive our leadership in specialty for our customers and partners. For example, through our ION and either value added solutions.

This includes our focus on maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings and we remain on track to delivering on our commitments to the rating agencies. Notably, our financial and strategic position has enabled the continued enhancement of our healthcare capabilities. In reading the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare which we completed in June.

Now, I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our Fourth Quarter and fiscal 2021 results and to discuss fiscal '22 products. Jim.
Jim Cleary: Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. For AmerisourceBergen, fiscal 2021 was a momentous year as we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Amerisource and Bergen Brunswig merger, completed both the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, and the extension of the Walgreens contract through 2029, and our team delivered another year of strong performance driven by our continued execution and strategic positioning. Our pharmaceutical - centric business, robust customer relationships, and leadership in specialty distribution and services, conditioned us to be a partner in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access on a global scale. Before I turn to our results, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year, September Quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. I will provide commentary in 3 main areas this morning. First, I will review our consolidated results and segment performance in fiscal 2021, and then it will discuss our new reporting segments beginning in fiscal 2022 and will conclude with fiscal 2022 guidance. Beginning with our fourth-quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39, an increase of 26.5%, which was driven by both a full quarters worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the strong performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment. Our consolidated revenue was $58.9 million up approximately 20% reflecting growth in pharmaceutical distribution and other. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue would have been up 9% from the prior-year quarter. Consolidated gross profit was $2 billion up 51% driven by increases in gross profit in both pharmaceutical distribution and other which benefited from the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. This quarter's gross profit margin of 3.4% is 71 basis points higher than the prior-year quarter as we had a full quarter of Alliance Healthcare in our consolidated results. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.3 billion versus $795 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to the addition of Alliance Healthcare, as well as investments in our talent, and initiatives to support the Company's current and future growth. This quarter's operating expense margin of 2.23% is 61 basis points higher than the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the full quarter impact Alliance Healthcare in our consolidated results. Also, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we had a bad debt reversal of $13 million that impacts the year-over-year comparison operating expenses. Turning now to consolidated operating income. Our operating income was $694 million, up 31% compared to the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by increases in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and other, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance. Operating income margin was 1.18%, an increase of 10 basis points as a result of the contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the continued benefit from some of our higher-margin businesses. Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the Fourth Quarter. Net interest expense was $55 million, up 57% due to debt related to Alliance Healthcare. Our effective income tax rate was 20.3% compared to 21.7% in the prior-year quarter. The lower effective tax rate was due to a change in mix of domestic and international income from the prior-year quarter. Our diluted share count was 210.8 million shares at 2.2% increase due to the impact of the issuance of 2 million shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and dilution related to employee stock compensation. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now, I'll turn to our segment results for the fourth quarter. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $51.2 billion, up 8% in the quarter. Driven by an increased sales of specialty products, strong execution across our Pharmaceutical Distribution Businesses, and overall positive prescription utilization trends. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income increased by 11% to $472 million. Operating income margin expanded by 2 basis points to 0.92% in the quarter. AmerisourceBergen's continued leadership in specialty distribution allowed us to capture the benefits of strong utilization trends during the quarter. I will now turn to other, which includes Alliance Healthcare, MWI, World Courier, and AmerisourceBergen consulting. In the quarter, other revenue was $7.7 billion up from $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by a full quarter's worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare, as well as growth in the global commercialization services and animal health businesses. Other operating income was $223 million up from $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. That concludes our fiscal fourth quarter discussion. Now I will turn to a discussion of our full-year fiscal 2021 results. Our consolidated revenue was $214 million up 13% driven by growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and other, which includes 4 months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue was up 9% from the prior year. Consolidated operating income grew 20% for the year to $2.6 billion, driven by strong performance across our businesses and the 4-month contribution of Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated operating income increased by an exceptional 12% from the prior year driven by growth in our higher-margin businesses, strong fundamentals across our business, and the important work our team has done to support COVID therapy distribution for hospitalized patients. From a segment perspective, pharmaceutical distribution services had operating income growth of 13% due to strong performance across our portfolio of businesses and customers. And fiscal 2021 we continued to capitalize on our leadership and specialty distribution, both in addition space and health systems. We saw a less significant contribution from health systems as our differentiated solutions that was leveraged by manufacturers to meet the complex logistics for the distribution of COVID-19 antivirals and therapies to hospitals across the country. Additionally, we continue to have strong performance and specialty physician services this fiscal year. As the healthcare system has become more accustomed to operating in the current environment. This supported physician diagnosis and related testing and screening processes resulting in more normal levels of new patient starts. In other, operating income grew 54% year-over-year to $615 million. Other meaningfully benefited from the four months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare results while World Courier and MWI also delivers strong results. As global logistics continued to be challenged by the pandemic, World Courier provided its expertise and innovative solutions to manufacture partners around the world, facilitating the movement of temperature sensitive and other high priority shipments. World Courier is direct to patient in-home clinical trials continued to be a differentiator as patients and manufacturers saw alternative lower acuity care sites. MWI continued to experience strong performance in the companion animal market as pet parents maintain their focus on their pet's health. In the Production Animal market, the reopening of restaurants and return of travel boosted protein demand. Turning now to tax rates, our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 21.3% compared to 20.8% in the prior fiscal year, which benefited from discrete tax items. Turning now to EPS, our full-year adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% and $9.26 primarily due to strong growth and execution across our business, including continued leadership and out-performance and specialty. And the four month contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion, which was better than our expectations due primarily to the timing of certain customer payments in September, a benefit that will reverse in the December quarter due to higher supplier payables. There was also better than expected cash flow at Alliance Healthcare. If you normalize for the timing-related benefit, our adjusted free cash flow of the year was a ban, roughly $1.7 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, excluding restricted cash of approximately $500 million. That completes the review of our fiscal 2021 results. I will now discuss updates to our segment reporting, which will go into effect in fiscal 2022. Following the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the subsequent change to the geography of our business, we undertook a strategic evaluation in how we report our segments in order to provide alignment with business operations. Following this review, which concluded in October, we will begin reporting our results and 2 new segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. U.S. healthcare solutions and international healthcare solutions. The U.S. healthcare solutions segment or consist of our legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, excluding Profarma Distribution, plus following businesses which had previously been reported and other. MWI Animal Health, Xcenda marsh group and ICS 3PL. The International Healthcare Solutions Segment will consist of our non-US based pharmaceutical distribution and services solutions, including Alliance Healthcare World Courier in Amar and Profarma distribution and Profarma Specialty. As a reminder, we consolidate for farmers results due to our ownership interest and governance of the publicly traded entity. Profarma Specialty was previously reported and other. This morning, we are also filing Form 8-K with re-segmented financial for fiscal 2021 in order to help your quarterly modeling. Our new reporting segments, like AmerisourceBergen are built on the foundation of leading and pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses offering value-added solutions in key markets. Turning now to discuss our fiscal 2022 guidance. And as a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. So all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Starting with revenue, we expect consolidated revenue to grow in the highest single-digit to low double-digit percent range. On a segment level, we expect U.S. healthcare solutions revenue to be approximately $207 billion to $212 billion representing growth of 2% to 5% year-over-year. In international Healthcare Solutions, we expect revenue of approximately $26 billion to $27 billion. Moving on to operating income, we expect consolidated operating income to grow in the mid to high teens percent range On a segment level, we expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income to be between $2.325 billion and $2.4 billion representing growth of 3% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. The only business that was included in the pharmaceutical distribution services that has not going into U.S. Healthcare Solutions is Proforma Distribution, which contributed less than 1% of revenues for pharmaceutical distribution services and fiscal 2021, and roughly 1% of segment operating income. As a reminder, as I said back in February and again in August, we had a significant tailwind in fiscal 2021 related to the financial contribution from sales of COVID-19 therapies. We did have higher than expected COVID therapy sales in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by sales in the month of August with the subsequent substantial declines in September. The final EPS benefit from COVID therapy sales for full-year fiscal 2021 was $0.30, $0.14 of which was in the first quarter. If you estimate the first quarter of fiscal 2022 based on the even lower October trends, that contribution from COVID therapies sales would be $0.03, which means the First Quarter would have an $0.11 headwind for U.S. Healthcare Solutions Segment. While this reduces the segment's growth rate in the first fiscal quarter, we expect full-year operating income growth of 3% to 6% in U.S. healthcare solutions. We expect international healthcare solutions to have operating income between $685 million and $715 million dollars. Alliance Healthcare represents a little over two-thirds of operating income in the segment with World Courier making up the majority of the remainder of segment operating income. As you think about your first-quarter models, we expect about 25% of the international segment's operating income to occur in the first quarter. As you look at fiscal 2022 for the international segments, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, we have agreed to sell Profarma Specialty as we focus on our core operating assets. The transaction is under regulatory review and is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2020. Successful completion of the divestiture is factored into our guidance and represents a 2% headwind to our international Healthcare Solutions segment's operating income. Second in fiscal 2022, we will have a step-up in expenses at Alliance Healthcare that was fully contemplated when we announced the acquisition and is generally related to I.T. modernization. As Steve said earlier, we view technology and systems as fundamental to our operations and business continuity. And this step-up in fiscal 2022 expense will help align Alliance Healthcare's business technology, operability, and infrastructure with AmerisourceBergen, Alliance Healthcare continues to deliver on our expectations for the business, and we expect Alliance to be high pains, accretive to our standalone adjusted diluted EPS in fiscal 2022. Since closing the Transaction, our teams have been engaged both in-person and virtually and have furthered our strong relationships. Most recently, we held a deep dive with leaders across AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare focused on Alliance Healthcare as manufacturer services, businesses. I continue to be impressed by the strong and efficient business and team alliance and appreciate the collective thoughtfulness around creating long-term value for stakeholders through our innovative solutions. Moving onto interest expense, tax rate and share count, we expect interest expense to grow in the mid-teens percent range as a result of debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2022 based on current tax rates in effect for fiscal 2022. But now the tax rate benefit from Alliance Healthcare's operations are range would have been 1% higher on both the top and bottom end of the range. Finally, we expect that our share count will increase to approximately 212 million shares as a result of the full-year impact of the 2 million shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the closing of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and normal dilution from stock compensation expense. As a reminder, it's part of our commitment to maintain our strong investment grade credit rating, we are committed to paying down $2 billion in total debt over the next 2 years in lieu of share repurchases. We currently expect to pay down roughly half that amount towards the end of fiscal 2022. As a result of these expectations, reflecting the strength of our business, we are guiding for adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.50 to $10.80. Reflecting year-over-year growth of 13% to 17%. Turning now to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations, CapEx is expected to be in the range of $500 million as we continue to invest to further advance our business or to buy Alliance Healthcare's IT infrastructure and support additional growth opportunities. For adjusted free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which includes the benefit of Alliance Healthcare in our results for the entire fiscal year. In closing, fiscal 2021 was another successful year for AmerisourceBergen as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, while the pandemic persisted. I'm proud of our 42,000 team members who work tirelessly to support our customers, partners, and patients, and drove our strong financial results. Given the steps we took in 2021 to advance our business, I'm excited about our 2022 fiscal year as we continue to deliver stakeholder value. As we continue to drive our business forward, we will maintain our focus on our differentiated capabilities, supported by our dedicated team members. AmerisourceBergen is guided by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures built on a foundation of leadership and pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by complementary is higher margin businesses that leverage our pharmaceutical scale and expertise to create unparalleled value our manufacturer partners and healthcare provider customers. With that I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.
Operator: The first question will be from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Good morning and thank you for all the detailed commentary. Jim, I just want to go back to your comments around the U.S. drug distribution. I understand that there is a number of incremental businesses that are now within that segment. But you made a comment about COVID-19 therapies. So when we think about 2022, 1, Is there nothing built into your expectation around that? And 2. Just given the number of new therapies that are coming to market, For example, I think about the new Merck therapy that just been announced. Is it not reasonable to think that there's going to be some benefit as we go into 2022 for COVID therapies, would be my first question. And then secondly, can you just help us to understand the underlying trends. So for example, what are your expectations around utilization trends? What's your expectation around cost cold flu? Acute scripts kind of coming back and people visiting the office -- the physician office again, etc. If you can just help us to better understand that, that'd be great. Thank you.
Jim Cleary: Lisa, thank you. Great question. I'll answer that question from a financial perspective and then I think Steve will want to add in and talk a little bit more about the business. But as you know, in our guidance for this year for our U.S. Healthcare Solutions Segment is going to revenue growth of 2% to 5%, and adjusted operating income growth of 3% to 6%. And it's based on continued strong performance really across the business, where we continue to benefit from our differentiated position. Now with regards to your question on COVID therapies, we don't expect to repeat the benefit that we had in fiscal year '21 from our exclusivity on the distribution of the main commercial COVID therapy. The benefit we got from COVID therapies in fiscal year '21 as I said in my prepared remarks was $0.30. Let me give you the some of the breakdown there. During the first quarter, it was $0.14, second quarter was $0.07, third quarter was $0.03, and fourth quarter was $0.06. So I'm sure that'll help you in your modeling. And as we're looking at fiscal year '22, we expect the benefit that we get in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 to be $0.03 so we have an $0.11 headwind in the first quarter of fiscal year '22. And so we do expect to have lower operating income growth in U.S. Healthcare Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 but we, of course, as I said, expect 3% to 6% operating income growth for the full year, which includes of course Q1. Now, you asked about other COVID therapies and of course it's early. But we may very well get some benefit from other COVID therapies. And that's exactly why we have -- one of the reasons why we have a range. And then we have a $0.30 range in our EPS between $10.50 and $10.80. We don't expect a lot of incremental benefit in the first quarter, but it could come later on in the year. Now, you also asked about utilization trends, which is a great question, and we are seeing strong utilization. trends across our business, which has improved sequentially from the positive trends that we noted in our third fiscal quarter. And prescription trends are strong and have returned to pre - COVID-19 levels. And we did see -- I have seen strong utilization improvement trends across the business in the second half of '21 and expect that to continue to benefit us in fiscal year '22 across our businesses and customers. And I see that Steve would like to just add a couple things on the overall business.
Steve Collis: Go on.
Jim Cleary: So with entering '22, I want all of our businesses are performing very well leased and benefiting from somewhat normal environment. That -- that the innovation factor that remains and I saw that the
Steve Collis:  while literally we're on the call,  the group in the UK that are. So continued innovation and it's possible that we could be working with some therapy in the future as we have in the past, particularly in the emergency use authorization phase is where we'd been successful in working on it, on an exclusive basis. We're happy and very -- if I look back on '21, I think of it as the year that the lion's deal got done and the year that we responded so well to assisting with the needs for comp responding to the COVID pandemic, and including keeping our people safe. So that's what I think will be the . But Jim, I think you gave an exhaust advance, so we'll probably move on to the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Jim, just wanted to follow-up on the guidance, particularly in international healthcare segment here. You said you were planning to sell the Profarma Specialty business and so there was a 2% headwind. That's 2% headwind to the full-year operating income? But it's not going to sell until so it's really double that for the back half of fiscal 2022. And did you give a revenue impact as well?
Jim Cleary: Yes -- no, we haven't given a revenue impact. But you are right, it is a 2% headwind for the whole year, and we're assuming, we're going to sell that during the first half of the year. And of course, our International Healthcare Solutions Segment is really driven by Alliance Healthcare being the largest partner segment and we feel very good about the performance of Alliance. It's operating at or above our deal model. And then the next biggest piece of the International Healthcare Solutions Segment as of course, our World Courier Business, which is also performing well.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Sorry, doing 2 calls at once, I apologize. The -- basically, a lot of discussion points around freight costs, the ability for drug distributors to pass some of that through or have to absorb that, a lot of components to that. It can be higher labor costs, it could just be higher fuel costs, etc. But just curious to hear about how you guys are handling that and whether there's any impact in your business one way or the other or can you fully either pass that through or just not have that the material impact of the Company? Thanks.
Jim Cleary: I think really in summary that it is fully reflected in our guidance and in fiscal year '22, we do expect to continue to have higher expenses associated with picking, packing, shipping. There are some offsets from certain other FY21 expenses that are not planned to repeat in FY22 22, but of course we keep a close eye on economic trends that can impact our business and we have seen wage and transportation inflation across our business during the summer. We moved quickly to adjust wages to ensure that they remain competitive and market aligned, that's reflected, in our fourth-quarter results. And these things like higher labor and transportation costs, they're fully contemplated in our fiscal year '22 guidance. And we'll manage the expenses as we do each year and work with our partners and customers to ensure that we are diligent and maintaining our fair compensation for the  we provide. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Percher from Nephron Research, please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I want to take the other side of the U.S. question asked earlier. So this also includes MWI Animal Xcenda. Is it fair to assume that that's growing more than the 3% to 6% for the total segment. Are there any headwinds coming out of fiscal year '21 we should be aware of? And then relative to the resegmentation, when we look at 3% to 6%, is that apples and apples? Are there any changes in corporate expense? Now allocated to the EU segment or the global  entity in Switzerland that would impact the 3% to 6%.
Jim Cleary: Yeah. And so there aren't any changes in the corporate allocation. And when we add businesses like MWI, Animal Health, and the consulting businesses to U.S. Healthcare Solutions. MWI has had a stronger growth rate, particularly in fiscal year '21, the animal health business really benefited from the pandemic and the increase in pet ownership. And so that has been a higher growth business in fiscal year '21. Whereas the consulting business has been a lower growth business. And so I think that gives you a little bit of a little bit additional color there. And then one thing that we are doing today is, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are filing an 8-K, where we'll show the segments, the 2 new segments, we'll show that on an historical basis for fiscal year '21 and how they look in fiscal year '21. And I think probably a key thing is that when we look at the U.S. segment for this upcoming year, we're expecting 3% to 6% growth, which is largely apples-to-apples because of the size of the legacy business that are going into the new segment.
Eric Percher: That's very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Jailendra Singh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jailendra Singh: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. So I was wondering if you could comment on the potential impacts from the recent changes coming out of Washington around Medicare negotiating drug prices among other components. Their leading presents in specialty products, how do you think about the implications as Medicare ramps up the number of drugs it is negotiating?
Steve Collis: Now, thank you for the question. So, the U.S. says, I think somewhat over fixated on the cost of medications relative to overall healthcare spending. We've been very interesting benefit design, and we also prefer it when the market, create their own solutions for problems such high co-pays for adherence products that are some of the incremental system and our top  patient doesn't take the incident. We see some real strong benefits if we can remove some barriers that have been artificially created on products like that. On specialty, it's a little bit too early to tell. I think we've been through many changes in reimbursement, including the change, to EPS, and our tremendous growth in the hospital outpatient market for specialty drugs, and the wholesale is -- are very resilient. And we also do believe that, later said as I understand that pharmaceutical is the most efficient form of health care. So we did nothing that tremendously concerns us as a business. Our concern is always with preserving innovation, and making sure that our providers have a stable reimbursement environment that they can get, continue to run their businesses and take care of patients. But fairly saying we spent a lot of time and are very interested in. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks. Just in terms of the guidance, I just want to understand the capital deployment expectations. You gave us the share count. We understand that should we just assume that the vast majority of the free cash flow then will be to pay down debt or how should we think about it?
Jim Cleary: Yes. And so, as we've said before, we do plan to free down about 2/3 of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition debt by the end of fiscal year '23. We started that process, so it's about $2 billion that will be paying down during that time frame. We expect to pay down about half of that in fiscal year '22. And so that is one of the key parts of our capital deployment. We'll also, of course, continue to invest in the business and invest in current and future growth in fiscal year '22.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Eduardo Ron: Hi, guys. This is Eduardo on for Elizabeth. Just maybe given the Walgreens ' new expecting towards becoming a provider of healthcare services, how do you envision your relationship with them evolving and what can you do to support their new strategy?
Steve Collis: Thank you. We're tremendously proud of the benefits we're getting from the recently announced launch transaction, including that we have a contract with Boots, who's become a very significant customer with -- of our Alliance division through 2031. And most importantly, we extended Walgreens contract in the U.S. through 2029. And this is such a fundamental customer for us that helps us establish such a strong base of scale and efficiency. And I think the teams are at a very good state where we looked into how can we help with one another's priority. Already. We have these discussions with all our large customers and the needs for the very large customers like Walgreens, are very different than, say, independent. They're into community . RV gap, for example, we, supporting WBA with a central full initiatives. And we're looking to understand better how we can help with the strategies on the institutional side. So I just would say that the relationship is in a good place and we still go back at 2013 agreement as being very fundamental to the success of AmerisourceBergen over the last decade.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for the color so far. If I could just circle back a bit on the America's growth in the U.S. healthcare segment. And as you think about the moving pieces, and I appreciate the color, Jim, you gave so far relative to the market improvement. But in terms of the upside downside of the range, what are the macro factors have to look like to get to those numbers? And I'm more just curious because on an all-in basis to have obviously been tracking higher than that in outpacing the rest of the market. And so whether -- they are antivirals or one component, but what else are the moving pieces that you think about in terms of what encapsulates the range on the U.S. segment?
Jim Cleary: Sure. And so one of the -- one of the key things is something that I -- I've talked about. In the prepared remarks and then also in an earlier answer, but I will just quickly cover it again, given the scale. And that's the impact that COVID therapies could have. So that really impacts the range. And again, it was a $0.30 of benefit in fiscal year 21, and $0.14 at that came in the first quarter of fiscal year '21. And we're expecting that the benefit will be significantly less in fiscal year '22. But Steve talked about some of the innovation that's occurring. It could be higher and so that's something that certainly could impact the range and that would be one of the larger things. And then of course there's always a number of moving pieces in our businesses. We have very strong performing businesses, but there's moving pieces within the businesses in terms of growth rates. And then there's sorts of things that are also mentioned, like some higher labor and transportation costs and how those trend. And so those are some of the things that impact us within the range, but I do want to say that we have a lot of confidence in the business and we are expecting continued strong performance across the business because of our differentiated physician and diagonal sprint both within pharmaceutical distribution and manufacturer solutions.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Collis for any closing remarks.
Steve Collis: Thank you. Operator. It's truly been an honor to spend this hour due highlighting a very successful 2021, which the management team is extremely proud of. We're also really proud of and appreciative the tremendous efforts of our associates. We enter fiscal year '22 with all of our businesses performing well, and we look forward to building on this success and remains of fiscal year '22. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you, sir. Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, you may now disconnect."
