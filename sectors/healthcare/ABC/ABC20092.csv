"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AmerisourceBergen Second Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the conference over to your host Mike Kilpatric. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Good morning everybody and welcome to AmerisourceBergen’s conference call covering fiscal 2009 second quarter results. I am Mike Kilpatric, Vice President Corporate and Investor Relations. And joining me today are David Yost AmerisourceBergen President and CEO, and Mike DiCandilo, Executive Vice President, CEO (sic) (NASDAQ:CFO) of AmerisourceBergen and COO of AmerisourceBergen’s Drug Corporation. During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings including our 10-K report for fiscal 2008. Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be taped without the express permission of the company. As always, those connected by telephone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening comments. And here is Dave Yost, AmerisourceBergen’s President and CEO to begin our remarks.
R. David Yost: Good morning and thank you for joining us. ABC had a strong second fiscal quarter, historically our strongest quarter, which speaks to the resiliency of our customer base and our company and our ability to continue to deliver strong performance in turbulent economic environments. Total revenues were $17.3 billion, down 2.5% versus last year. You will recall that last year was leap year resulting in one less working day in this year's March quarter. You will also recall. We discontinued $3 billion of Walgreen warehouse business July 1, 2008, which impacted this quarter’s revenues about 4%. Net of the loss Walgreen’s business, revenues on a per day basis were up about 3% this quarter versus last year. As was demonstrated in our financial metrics, our revenues were high in quality, reflecting our mix of product, our customer base and lack of customer concentration, and our continued focus on customers where we have the opportunity to provide value-added services. In any environment, but particularly slower growth environment having the right customers is one key to strong performance. Gross margin increased for the quarter reflecting our generic revenue growth, good performance from our Specialty Group, and a strong seasonal by side environment. The associates of ABC again delivered outstanding expense control. We ran ABC in total with fewer dollars than we did in the same quarter last year excluding special items, while continuing to make important investments in our future, most notably our business transformation program. Our cE2 customer efficiency, cost effectiveness, operating philosophy continues to pay dividends. Our operating margin increased again this quarter versus last year, this time, a robust 11 basis points. I would remind you that we have increased our annual operating margin by six or seven basis points in each of the last three fiscal years, and we will continue to focus on operating margin with a goal of low-to-mid-single digit expansion this year. Operating income was up 6%, diluted EPS from continuing operations was up a very strong 17% to $0.95 per share. This is on top of a 21% increase in EPS in the March quarter of 2008. So we are putting strong earnings performance on top of strong earnings performance. In addition, we continue to do an outstanding job of managing our assets, with our receivables, at 18 days, and our inventory turns over 14 times generating well over $300 million of cash for the quarter. It is important to note that in these turbulent economic times, our DSOs have declined, which speaks to the quality of our customers and our organizational structure and associates. So what’s to like about the quarter. Before we hit some of the company specifics on the quarter, I would like to address a few industry issues. First, the environment in Washington. Things are moving very quickly in our nation’s capital and the issue of healthcare reform is frequently in the news. Probably nothing is going to occur on the national scene that will dramatically affect our current fiscal year that ends in September. Looking to fiscal 2010 and beyond, we think the $46 million or so uninsured will be addressed, which will increase pharmaceutical utilization, a strong positive for ABC and our industry. Though, we are watching the issue of importation closely, we think the security of the pharmaceutical supply channel will dominate and sideline this topic. In total, we are not seeing anything in the healthcare reform debate currently that we think will be a big negative for ABC and could in fact be a strong positive. Next, the competitive climate, I would continue to describe the industry as I have consistently described it for many quarters, as competitive, but stable. No large multi billion-dollar pieces of business have changed wholesale suppliers in the last several quarters, addressing in part the stability of the industry and reflecting the integration of wholesaler and customer that frequently occurs with large accounts. Gains and losses of smaller accounts tend to be somewhat anecdotal. And finally, still on the topic of industry issues, the manufacturer pricing environment. The March quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter due to buy-side contribution and this year was no exception. Though fee-for-service has mitigated much of the quarter’s fluctuations, resulting from manufacturer price increases, there are still some manufacturers not on fee-for-service and some on hybrid fee-for-service programs that result in periodic upside often in the March quarter. This above average March buy-side contribution will not continue throughout the second half of our fiscal year. That said, we expect the manufacturer’s pricing environment to be similar to last year with the brand name price increases expected to be in the 7% range for this full fiscal year. Now, a closer look to home and some specifics on ABC. Our associates delivered an outstanding March quarter reflecting several often mentioned themes. First, the resiliency of our business and our industry, second, the growth drivers of generics and specialty, and third the lack of customer concentration and the quality of our revenues, regarding resiliency, obviously this is as turbulent an economic environment as any of us have seen with what may be the slowest industry growth in my three and a half decades in the business. I would say the resiliency of our company and industry is being tested and ABC is passing the test with flying colors. Our performance in the last several quarters should provide confidence for future performance, even if the current economic environment continues in the near term. Regarding our growth engines, specialty and generics. Our Pro Generic Solution formulary continues to gain traction outpacing our retail and institutional growth as we continue to capture more of our customers generic business and expand our total revenues with customers that utilize our value-added services, a key one being generics in both our institutional and retail segments. Our retail focus continues to be on independence, regional chains and food/drug combos all of whom look to ABC for their growing generic needs among other services. Our good neighbor pharmacy program is an integral part of this strategy, now with over 3,000 stores participating and double-digit growth anticipated in the next year. We continue to stress generics in our institutional business as well with very positive results. Our AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, ABSG with a $15 billion annual revenue run rate continues to be extremely well positioned within the industry and grew revenues 8%. Our oncology business, which features the strongest physician interface in the industry, our plasma and vaccine business, our physician facing biotech and injectable business, our third-party logistics business and our reimbursement consulting and analytics business all did very well. ABSG has the widest array of value-added services in this space by far, which accounts in part for the attractive operating margins, revenue growth, and its bright prospects for the future. In concluding our third theme, we have very little customer concentration with only one customer representing more than 10% of revenues and no other customer even close to 10%. We continue to focus on customers that look to us for value-added services, which is reflected in our expanding operating margin, and in doing so, avoid margin impacts that may occur with large customer repricing. Mike will provide insight on each of our operating units, but let me give you the cliff notes. Each of our units, AmerisourceBergen Drug Company, AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group and AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group is properly positioned for the future. Each is focusing on the right mix of products with the right customers, controlling costs and managing assets and has the performance to prove it. Our focus on the future includes addressing our future IT capabilities and we continue to invest in a new broad based ERP system with SAP as its base to meet future needs of our customers under our program called business transformation. A brief comment on our increase in EPS guidance of $3.18 to $3.30 per share, an increase over our previous guidance of $3.08 to $3.25 a share. We are now halfway through our fiscal year and have better insight into our expected annual performance that we did six months ago. Particularly, our interest expense and our share repurchase which are the key drivers of our revision. We have the organizational debt, cash and balance sheet to handle mid-sized acquisitions of $200 million or less within our core business should opportunities arise and would consider something larger if it made sense. And we could respond quickly if necessary as I've noted on previous occasions. Before I turn the floor over to Mike for some added color. I want to emphasize my optimism for the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution industry and ABC’s position in that industry. The fundamentals of the industry continue to be strong as far out as any of us can see. The ABC circle of life continues to hold. The older people get, the more drugs they take, the more drugs they take, the older they get. The growth engines for ABC, generics and specialty continue to be the premiere space within the industry. Our diversified and un-concentrated customer base continues to be a great strength. We are a resilient company in a resilient industry. Here is Mike.
Michael D. DiCandilo: Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. Another very strong quarter in a series of strong quarters emphasizing our positioning in the right areas of the market, specialty and generics. Our cost discipline and working capital management were once again outstanding and DSOs continue to be under control. Our associates' attention to detail, operational execution and customer service continues to distinguish us in our marketplace and with our customers. In addition to our stellar operating margin expansion, our significant share reduction helped us generate very nice 17% EPS growth from continuing operations. And during the quarter, we were very pleased to see our performance recognized through our ratings upgrade from Standard & Poor’s. While we are extremely pleased with our second quarter results, I would like to remind everyone that our March or second fiscal quarter has traditionally been our strongest quarter from an earnings and margin perspective due to the relatively higher number of brand name drug price increases during the March quarter and this year was no exception. Despite a number of moving parts, a substantial amount of the increase in gross margin sequentially from the December quarter related to benefits from manufacturer price increases during the March quarter. Certainly our fee-for-service agreements have somewhat mitigated the variability of the quarterly price increases. However, the 15% or so of our brand name business that is still subject to the timing and magnitude of manufacturer price increases continues to benefit the March quarter more than any other. Now turning to the income statement, which I will walk down starting with our top line. Revenues decreased 2.5% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the expected decline in Walgreen’s warehouse sales, as well as the impact of having one less business day in the quarter. EX the Walgreen business and business day impact sales would have increased 3% and we continue to expect revenues to grow 1% to 3% for the year with the highest growth in the fourth quarter, as we annualize the lost Walgreen’s warehouse business. Drug company revenues were down 4% in the quarter reflecting the Walgreen’s impact on retail sales. In addition, institutional sales growth moderated during the quarter as we reached the one-year anniversary of our large PBM contract. The second quarter is the drug company's toughest quarterly comparison to last year and we would expect the second half of the fiscal year to reflect solid growth as the impact of net new business wins becomes more apparent. Our Specialty Group revenues grew a solid 8% once again exhibiting growth broadly across virtually all of its distribution and services companies. Our scale and specialty distribution gives us an unmatched efficiency advantage and combined with the breadth of our value-added services to biotech suppliers and physicians, uniquely positions us as the leader in this fast growing segment of the market. We continue to expect 5% to 7% growth for the Specialty Group for the year, as quarterly comparisons get a little more difficult in the next six months. In our Packaging Group, which is a reminder, represents less than one half of 1% of our total revenue, but approximately 5% of our operating profits. Revenues were flat sequentially and down versus last year due to continued delays with certain of its manufacturer customers receiving FDA approvals for new drug introductions. We expect to have a strong second half in this business and the future remains very bright, as contract packaging outsourcing trends have never been better. Gross profit was up 3% compared to the prior year despite the lower revenues due to increased generic revenues from our Pro Generic Solutions program. Gross profit increases from the high growth specialty business and increase contributions from fee-for-service agreements with our supplier partners. All of these positive factors combined to offset the normal competitive pressures on sell-side margins. There were no large unusual items affecting gross profit, during the quarter we did have a modest $2 million benefit from a dispute with a former customer similar in size to a $3 million litigation settlement that benefited us last March. Gross margins were up a significant 16 basis points compared to last year for many of the same reasons gross profit dollars increased, including the product mix shifts to generics increase supplier fees and gross margin expansion in our specialty business. Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $11.6 million compared to $9.6 million last year reflecting the healthy supplier price increase environment. We had expected price increases to moderate some compared to last year, but they have remained fairly consistent and as a result we now expect our LIFO charge for the year to be approximately $20 million similar to last year's charge. Operating expense dollars in the quarter, excluding facility consolidations and severance expense, were below last year's quarter once again reflecting continued discipline. At each of our business units, significant productivity improvements in our distribution facilities and continued benefits from our prior year organizational streamlining. This decline was achieved despite approximately $9 million of increased expense over the last year's quarter for our ERP enabled business transformation project. As Dave mentioned, we continue to be very focused on our cE2 customer efficiency and cost effectiveness philosophy, and those of you who have followed us for a long time know that we have been consistently focused on cost and working capital management over the years and not simply reactive to current economic conditions. Cost discipline is a way of life at ABC. Facility consolidations and employee severance costs were $4.3 million in the quarter compared to $1.4 million last March and consisted of severance costs related to Canadian facility consolidations in our automation business as well as some movement on an old employment issue with a former Bergen executive. Operating income was up 6% and operating margins were 143 basis points in the quarter up an impressive 11% basis points including the impact of the larger facility consolidation and severance costs. This was due to the combination of our significant gross margin expansion and expense control in the quarter. For the first six-months of fiscal 2009, operating margins have increased 7 basis points, which should everyone confidence that we will expand operating margins over the year. Interest expense for the quarter of $14.5 million was down 22% from the prior year quarter due to lower average net borrowings and lower than expected variable short-term interest rates, primarily on our revolving credit facility where rates were down over 300 basis points from last March. We now expect a net interest expense for the year will be comparable to last year’s $64 million. Previously, we thought current year interest expense would be higher than last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter of 38.2% was down from last year’s 38.9% and we continue to expect our annualized effective rate to be in the 38.4% range. Our EPS growth from continuing operations in the March quarter exceeded our income from continuing operations growth of 8% due to the $11 million, or 7% reduction in average outstanding shares compared to last March, primarily as a result of our share repurchase program over the last 12 months. Currently, we are expecting average outstanding shares to be down between 6% and 7% for the full year in fiscal 2009, which is higher than our previous 5% expectation. Now, let’s turn to our cash flow and the balance sheet. As expected, we reversed much of our first quarter seasonal inventory build and we generated $337 million of cash from operations in the second fiscal quarter more than offsetting our first quarter usage. We had $26 million of capital expenditures in the quarter and $69 million in the first six months and continue to expect to spend approximately $140 million for the year. From a statistical standpoint, DSOs were down about one half day from last year's March quarter averaging 18.2 days for the quarter. We continue to be pleased that our customer receivables have not deteriorated in the current economic environment and we continue to benefit from strong credit management and a diverse customer base in which only one customer exceeds 10% of our revenue and/or receivables. Our average inventory days on hand during the quarter were 26 days, up a day from last year offset by average payable days also being up one-day compared to last year. From a share repurchase perspective; we bought back $92 million worth of our shares during the quarter in a $180 million through the first six months. We remain on track to purchase approximately $350 million of our shares for the full year. Our gross debt to total capital ratio at the end of March was 30% in line with our 30% to 35% target. Now, turning to our fiscal 2009 guidance. We have raised and narrowed our diluted EPS from continuing operations range to between $3.18 and $3.30 per share from the previous range of $3.08 to $3.25. This new EPS range continues to reflect annualized revenue growth of 1% to 3%, operating margin expansion in the low to mid single-digit basis point range, free cash flow of $460 to $535 million in share repurchases of $350 million evenly throughout the year. The uptick in EPS guidance was primarily driven by a further reduction in expected share count for the year, now between 6% and 7%, compared to last year and reduced expectations for interest expense now expected to be comparable to our prior year interest expense of $64 million. So to summarize another strong quarter and a great first half for the year, we are in the right markets, generic and specialty, with the right customers and our day-to-day execution combined with stellar costs and working capital management continues to distinguish us in our marketplace. Now here is Mike Kilpatric.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Thank you, Mike. We will now open the call to questions. I would ask you to limit yourself to one question, until we go ahead and had an opportunity. And then if there is time, you can ask additional questions. Go ahead Kathy.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Go ahead please.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks good morning. Good job. Nice performance in the generics growth again in this quarter, coming I think very close to what you did last quarter. Market is concerned that there are not as many branded generic conversion this year maybe that had some people worried your generic growth was slow, and I'm curious what’s your thoughts on that or and if you have confidence, you can keep up the double-digit pace going forward? Thanks.
R. David Yost: Thanks Eric. The answer to your question is yes. We do think, we can keep that up and that’s a function of us having a growing part of our customer’s business, and this is a growing part for them. So, we have a growing part of a growing part. In addition, we've gone outside of retail to the institutional market, where we have also gotten a good penetration. So, the two big growth drivers we have going forward Eric, which we've talked about many times, one is generic and the other is specialty distribution and services and the generics are exactly where we thought they would be, and we are very confident of our ability to continue to grow them in the future.
Eric Coldwell: Dave, just a quick followup on the institutional side, you are referencing the penetration in the hospital accounts, or is it some other channel institutionally?
R. David Yost: It’s into the hospitals, Eric, and we are very optimistic that will continue to grow.
Eric Coldwell: Great. Good job guys. Thanks.
R. David Yost: Thanks.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. That will come from John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
John Ransom: Hi, I have one, and this is kind of a boring question, for such an exciting company. This is a boring question. The first of all boilerplate what’s your quarter-end share count?
Michael D. DiCandilo: The quarter end share count is 151, 150.969.
John Ransom: Could you care that have a couple more decimals. That’s pretty good. So my question is philosophically, you guys even if you execute your share repo program and our motto, we have you building an incremental $300 million plus in cash on your balance sheet, so this kind of puts you close to $900 million in cash and above $1 billion in debt? Is there any reason that you wouldn’t crank up your share repos a bit, given how much cash you are building?
R. David Yost: Well, it’s a great question John. And I think, our answer is pretty consistent what we've said in the past, may not our year has progressed exactly as we had expected it to. We have a significant cash flow generation projected for the second half of the year and to the extent, we achieve that, and we expect to. We should have a lot of cash on hand. We have been a little reluctant in this environment to spend it too quickly with the uncertainty in the credit markets, and we continue to have our eye on acquisitions and to the extent that some of those acquisition opportunities would not come to fruition, and we have the cash as we have shown in the past. We would not be hesitant to return some of that to shareholder. So I think…
John Ransom: Okay.
R. David Yost: Our history pretty much tells you our thoughts about that issue.
John Ransom: And on that topic and I will jump by the queue here. I don’t see anywhere you have $64 million in interest expense. So you are reporting five this quarter like I said, you will generate most of your cash flow in the back half of the year. So, if anything it looks like interest expense would be something more or like $56 to $58 million, not the $64 million that you reference, so are you, is there something in the interest expense number as you deleverage that would cause it to go up?
R. David Yost: A good question, John. I mean it maybe a little bit conservative, but we do have in April we will renew our Puerto Rican revolving credit facility, our $55 million facility and there will be some fees associated with that, as well as somewhat higher interest rates on that facility. And we also expect during the second half of the year to renew our receivable securitization facility, which is a $975 million facility. And again, there will be some fees associated with that, as well as probably including a facility fee that will be somewhat higher so…
John Ransom: Okay.
R. David Yost: Those events are factored into the second half.
John Ransom: Okay, thank you.
R. David Yost: Thanks John.
Michael D. DiCandilo: Thanks John.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question please?
Operator: That will come from Larry Marsh with Barclays Capital.
Larry Marsh: Thanks and good morning. Dave, I don’t think you have to convince me or anyone else that you are serious about managing your costs, given your long record?
R. David Yost: Right.
Larry Marsh: I just wanted to maybe drill down on the market dynamic, and maybe a little bit of pricing. And I know in the past, you have said your top line is only consistent with market growth, and I know that have been consistent, though I guess IMS is saying now down 1% to 2% for the U.S. for this year, some message there you feel like you take a little bit of share now this year or do you, would you disagree with the forecast, I just had a quick followup on pricing?
R. David Yost: I will tell, I'm not sure I want to bet my career on that forecast. But from IMS, particularly given the recent script things that they’ve reporting and what appears to be happening in March, which is a kind of encouraging. So, I think that’s the key takeaway. To the effect, to the extent that the market is slowing down, because of generics, I mean that’s good upside for us that gives us a great opportunity. I guess the last thing, I would add is, if the market is slowing down, I think we've demonstrated in the last couple of quarters that given our mix and our customers, we can prosper in the slow growth environment. The only other thing I would say is, I haven’t got a chance, I just kind of seeing the headlines. I haven’t got a chance to look at the details, but I don’t think IMS is accounting for any uptick in any government programs for the uninsured and I will tell you, it’s not an imminent issue, but when you look out at 2010 and beyond, we clearly think that’s going to be a factor. So, a long answer, but I again not sure I want to bet my career on it.
Larry Marsh: Yes, a fair point, and I guess just a follow-up for Mike on the pricing, you started talking about 7%, brand inflation, and I think you had said 5% previously. I don’t know most of your brand is now fee-for-service, but so you get a little bit of benefit there, why wouldn't we see some of that in upside in your gross profits. Are you saying basically you're managing LIFO charge to completely offset that uptick in pricing?
R. David Yost: Yeah. Well, I would certainly, when you look at our performance sequentially, the big increase between 1Q and 2Q, and the difference between Q2 and any other quarter is the impact of those price increases and a lot of the business that we have that still not on fee-for-service is very concentrated into the March quarter. And when I compared the March quarter to last March, it’s very comparable because we had that same dynamic last year. I think the real driver year-over-year has been the performance in generics, has been the performance in specialty, and I mentioned we did have an increase in contribution from fee-for-service that's as much due to the fact that we have added some new contracts, as it is purely due to a higher than expected price increase environment and you're absolutely right when you make the point that the increase LIFO charge does had, it does become somewhat of an offset to that FIFO price appreciation.
Larry Marsh: Right, it sounds like you continue to be conservative on how you manage that LIFO charge so, okay. That's all I wanted. Thanks.
R. David Yost: Thanks.
Michael D. DiCandilo: Thanks Larry.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. That will be Charles Boorady with Citi.
Charles Boorady: Hi thanks. Good morning. My one question series is going to be around generics, and I'll keep this to close to one, how is the M&A among the generic manufactures and also some of the manufacturing disruptions in India and elsewhere, how is that impacted your supply and also the pricing, the unit cost of generic drugs. And you mentioned double digit generic sales growth, I am wondering how much is that reflects improved compliance or an improvement in current accounts sales versus getting new customers on to your generic program?
R. David Yost: That’s a lot for one question.
Charles Boorady: That’s fewer than the previous question, I did okay.
R. David Yost: Let me kind of first hit, the consolidation issue, that is not having a big impact on us, resulted in manufactures who are very, very strong, and we have good working relationship with them and the like, we do keep a close eye on the supply opportunities for, from India to make sure, we’ve got ourselves covered. So, we make sure, we are supplying our customers’ needs, I mean put in perspective, our PROGenerics formulary has 500, 600 or so manufactures in it. So, it is very, very broadly based. I'm forgetting the next part. Mike, can you help me out?
Michael D. DiCandilo: Yeah, Charles you asked a little bit about compliance and versus market growth and I think we are probably little north of market growth. So compliance does have an element of it. And I think, Dave made an important point. It’s not just compliance in the retail sector, which has been a huge emphasis point for us for some time, but we are also starting to make some inroads into the institutional sectors. Both Dave mentioned that the hospitals where we are entering into new agreements with some large GPOs to start handling the oral solid generics, as well as opportunities in the alternate site space, which is an important point, because it’s really some of the alternate sight type of accounts whether they are nursing home providers or clinics or some of the fastest growing health care providers. And we have focused very much on tailoring generic programs to that segment and focusing on it. So, we’ve had definitely increases as a percentage of sale in the other than retial parts of our business.
R. David Yost: We get all of them?
Charles Boorady: He did thanks.
R. David Yost: Thanks Charles.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. That will be from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen Santangelo: Yes, hey Dave. I just have a quick follow-up question on your margins here. In your press release, you specifically called out, the higher margin from the specialty group and when you were kind of giving your prepared remarks, you went through the effort of talking about some of the service offerings that you have within that business. And as I think about that business historically, I think it’s the service piece that has the real high margin, but the specialty distribution piece is even lower margin kind of than your core distribution businesses, is the mix within specialty changing and as that business continues to outpace drug distribution growth should ultimately that continue to pull your margins up, just if you could elaborate and help me think about the impact, especially on margins? That would be helpful.
R. David Yost: Well, first of all Glen, they are both growing very, very well. And they are closely related, and that’s the point that I wanted to make is that, the fact that we have this broad service offering, which does carry with it more attractive margins is probably what's drawing, part of what is driving the distribution. The fundamentals of the distribution business of pure product are not that dissimilar from our base business. But it’s the opportunity to provide this wide array of value added services with products that are very sophisticated that is really driving that margin. So, that short answer your questions, we do expect the specialty business to outpace. We expect the specialty revenues to outpace the market in total in our drug business, and we expect to continue to have very attractive margins here.
Glen Santangelo: Okay, thanks a lot Dave.
R. David Yost: Right.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question?
Operator: That will come from Helene Wolk with Sanford Bernstein.
Helene Wolk: Good morning and thanks for taking the call. Just a quick question about the revenue growth and the guidance assumption, when we look at the IMS data and much like you commented earlier. We actually expect that the first quarters is going to come in somewhere perhaps around 3.5% making some assumptions about March. And I guess, I'm just trying to understand the difference between the market rate of growth, if that’s what it ultimately transpires, and what you are predicting or what you have shown in terms of the first quarter performance?
R. David Yost: Well, Helene, I would say the big emphasis we have is on quality of revenues, and not chasing revenues for revenue sake, so I think that’s the most important takeaway here. We are looking at expanding our revenues with customers where we have a great opportunity for value-added services one of the prime ones, being generic in the specialty business, a wide array of value-added service we will try, which I listed. So that’s the first point, the second point, I would make is, I'm not sure that you can fine tune the market quite that closely, but I do think you are directionally correct, it might end up being positive.
Michael D. DiCandilo: Yeah, I will just add to that Helene. I mean keep in mind, we’ve got a drag for the first nine months of the year that make sure you have factored in there, which would be with that $3 billion of Walgreens’ business, which is a 3% drag for the year, but roughly a 4% drag each of the first three quarters. And obviously when that, ex that, we've been talking about our growth being in the 3% or so range and obviously when that anniversary is in the July quarter, will have the highest revenue quarter of our year in the fourth quarter, but we're – we haven’t seen anything that makes us move away from that 1% to 3% gross target for the year.
Helene Wolk: And nothing in terms of the environment around any contract changes or anything else that would explain or be significant in the first quarter?
R. David Yost: No.
Helene Wolk: Okay. Thank you.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question?
Operator: Next, we have Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good morning everyone. Mike DiCandilo, can you maybe just walk us through the expectations around margins in the back half of the year. I heard Dave make the comment that obviously margins thus for the first half have improved 6 or 7 basis points. You're still expecting low double-digit expansion. So as we start to think about the next couple of quarters, obviously price increases won't help us much, but do you still have a number of generic opportunities, and I think it is laid out for someone else, the opportunities around specialty. So, it sounds like that still there. So, maybe just talk about what some of the headwinds are for margins in the next couple of quarters?
Michael D. DiCandilo: Well, we are still expect to have expansions at least just not at the rate that we’ve had in the first half of the year and the biggest issue there is, keep in mind, we do anniversary again the, that the loss of the Walgreens’ business in the fourth quarter, which actually hurts the margin expansion, because that helps bit some in the first three quarters. In addition, you may remember that we had a $12 million one-time item from a customer’s settlement or from a supplier’s settlement in the fourth quarter of last year, which added about 9 basis points to the fourth quarter. So, it’s more a function of us having a tougher comparison that it is to any change in our business prospect as we go forward in the third and fourth quarter.
Lisa Gill: And Mike, are you comfortable with talking about what you think sustainable type margins are for drug distribution, I mean as we think about going forward, I think that’s one of the concerns investors have in general is, what’s the sustainability of the margin in the drug distribution business. Given all these different factors that are out there right now?
Michael D. DiCandilo: Well Lisa, I'm very encouraged, particularly because of the product mix element when compared with our ability to control expenses. I mean our guidance, I think Dave mentioned in his comments we’re up 6 to 7 basis points each of the last three fiscal years from an operating margin perspective. We expect to be up again this year. And going forward, I think we expect to have operating margin expansion in the single digit basis point range. We haven't seen any thing that makes us feel any less optimistic about that, where we are strong, where the market is strong, generic specialty are both positive margin contributors.
R. David Yost: Yes, just I want to make sure, I am piling on just so sure there is no question. I'm in exactly the same spot here. We are very optimistic going forward, and again it’s picking up the right customers and focusing on those value-added services where we have opportunity. So, we are very optimistic going forward.
Lisa Gill: Great, I appreciate the comments.
R. David Yost: You bet, thank you.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. That comes from Robert Willoughby with Banc of America Securities.
Robert Willoughby: Thanks. Mike or Dave, did the inventory balances finish the quarter where you thought they would be or where they somewhat high post of weak flu season in a seasonal build?
R. David Yost: No, I think they were, very much where we expected to be rather, we do get some opportunities sometimes at the end of the quarter from manufactures and sometimes at the end of the quarter is a little bit higher than the average during the quarter. But I think, we are exactly where we expect to be. I mentioned that the days on hand averaged went up a day, during the quarter and it’s worthy, I guess just the mathematical result of average inventories being almost exactly the same quarter-over-quarter and ourselves being down a little bit, but with the expectation, that’s going to pick up in the second half, that will correct itself over the next six months.
Robert Willoughby: The Walgreens’ inventory was not on your balance sheet? Or was it there?
R. David Yost: You mean this time last year?
Robert Willoughby: Yeah.
R. David Yost: Yeah, it would have been.
Robert Willoughby: You do book that?
R. David Yost: Bob, in July 1, we discontinued the business, and the inventory associated with that business would have gone in that quarter. So last year, we would have had inventory from that in our total last year.
Robert Willoughby: I am sorry from an accounting perspective, you do book that inventory?
R. David Yost: Yes.
Robert Willoughby: Okay. Great. Thank you.
R. David Yost: Okay.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. That will be Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Muken: Good morning. In terms of the customer base, are you seeing anything on the retail side to suggest you that, there is any bit of need for pricing pressure on that side of the market. And I know, you've talked all the sort of the positives on the margin side, but as we look forward in it, this economy continues to deteriorate, the other good sense that, kind of your core customers are in relatively decent enough shape that you are not going to see much from a, either them coming back to you, because they are getting pressure in their core business or potentially failures on the small retailer independent side?
R. David Yost: We are not seeing anything unusual. I mean, I have been in this business over 35 years, Ross, and it’s, we have normal competitive pressure or particularly as your larger customers increase market share and the like. But we are not seeing anything out of the ordinary. I will tell you, I just came back from a National Association of Chain Drug Stores convention, NACDS. And I had the opportunity to interface with a lot of the regional chains, which is a big focus for us to food/drug combos or regional chains. And they were very optimistic about where they were in the marketplace in going forward. So, I would tell you from a historic perspective, I don't see anything really unusual from where we are right now.
Ross Muken: Great. Thanks. That was helpful.
R. David Yost: Okay.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. That’s Mickey. I am sorry, Ricky Goldwasser with UBS.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning.
R. David Yost: Good morning Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser: Couple of questions. One is for on the customer side; some of the pharma companies have been talking about de-stocking going on. What are you seeing in the marketplace in terms of your customers being more effective in managing inventory? And then on the bulk revenue, bulk with lighter than, what you reported in the December quarter. Do you think this is a seasonal thing or should we model, bulk being at that lower level for the remainder of the year?
Michael D. DiCandilo: Let me hit the first one. Ricky just talk about the issue of our customers, I would say, one of the great values we bring to our customers is them to be able to match up their inventories very closely with the revenues. I mean we literally, they can order merchandise from us late in the day, early evening and they get the sale merchandise the next day, by truck, by noon. One of the great benefits we bring to the customers is to allow them to run on very, very thin inventories and still be responsive to their customers with very high service level. It’s one of the great benefits of the whole prime vendor arrangement PVA arrangements that we have. So I'm not seeing anything unusual there and interfacing with relatively large number of our regional chains, and food/drug combos in the last several days. I'm not hearing anything anecdotally that leads me to believe that there is anything unusual going on there.
Michael D. DiCandilo: Yeah. Your other question Ricky about the bulk, I think the quarterly bulk revenues is a good approximation of our run rate going forward, obviously it’s down significantly from the prior year due to the change we made last year in our relationship with our large PBM customer.
Ricky Goldwasser: Right. But we are also seeing a sequential change. So you expect that to be consistent for the remainder of the year?
Michael D. DiCandilo: Yeah. I think it’s going to be pretty much the same now, understand some of that’s in the control of the customer as much as it is us, but we're forecasting pretty much in line with what we have this quarter.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. Thank you.
Michael D. DiCandilo: Thanks Ricky.
R. David Yost: Thanks Ricky.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We have Charles Rhyee with Oppenheimer.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. It kind of relates Dave to your comments here about your regional chains in food/drug combos. Can you give us a sense here on the sort of what share of your generics program this group has sort of become relative to maybe [being up] the pure independence, and that maybe let us know how that’s shifted overtime? And also you talked a little bit early about increasing institutional complaint. Can you just maybe give us some background on how that relationship works? Generally my understanding is that with the hospitals, you're working through some larger GPO contracts. How were they buying generics beforehand and how is that changing? Thanks.
R. David Yost: Well. First of all in terms of the food/drug combos versus the independence versus regional chains. We haven’t broken that out in the past, Charles, those all kind of weave together and particularly when you talk about independence, lot of independence on multiple stores and in fact all are some regional chains. The important takeaway here is in that total customer group though, we are getting very good generic penetration. As a general rule, this group is not doing any warehousing. So, we are meeting all of their generic needs. So, that’s part of the reason we’ve been able to increase our generic revenue is that we are capturing more and more if not all of that merchandise category for this customers. In terms of the institutional compliance though with some of the large hospital groups, historically they have done some of their own bidding and that has gone out and got and gotten their own generic contracts, which we in turn would administer for them. There has been a movement of late for them to instead of doing that using the generic program that we have and kind of piggybacking on the generic program that we have, which reflects our broad-based volume. So, we kind of add their volume to our volume and everybody benefits. And I think that’s a trend that will probably see more and more off and I think it just speaks to the close working relationships that many of the hospital buying groups and other buying groups as well have with wholesalers. Clearly, AmeriSourceBergen I think it is an industry trend as well.
Charles Rhyee: So, basically I am just to, just clarify you're just saying that the GPO contracts, like let’s say a Premier, Novation, when you have those that prime agreement and that’s getting the generic piece is being pulled into the master, sort of the master agreement?
R. David Yost: Well, I don't want to put call out any individual GPOs by name, but what we are seeing more of is combining the GPOs the utilization, with our utilization, kind of having a bigger part to go as part of our bidding volume. In the past, you might have had that fragment, you might have had that GPO doing their own bidding, and several GPOs doing their own bidding, and ours and now we are combining that altogether. So we have a lot more scale. And I think it’s serving everyone very, very well, and it’s also bringing some efficiencies to the manufacturers well. So it’s really a win-win situation. And again I think it really reflects the working relationships that have developed between the buying groups and the wholesalers over the years.
Charles Rhyee: Great. Thanks for the comment.
R. David Yost: You bet.
Michael N. Kilpatric: Next question please.
Operator: We will go to Richard Close with Jefferies & Company. Richard Close – Jefferies & Co. Yeah, Dave, I think you mentioned competitive environment being stable, no large change of contracts, normal gains and losses in the smaller contracts. And I think you have said in the past about one-third of the contracts come up for bid per year, if I'm not mistaken. Since, we are halfway through this current fiscal year. I was wondering, if you could give us an update on your win rate maybe compared to previous year’s retention rates?
R. David Yost: I think there is kind of nothing unusual. I mean the three year mark has a tendency, it just reflects the fact that in general we have three-year contracts, three to four year contracts, it's not unusual. We tend do not be involved in the ring, big multi-billion dollar contracts. But there is, as I mentioned, there’s not been a lot of movement even with the big contracts in the market and the smaller accounts, it tends to be somewhat anecdotal, but we are not seeing any unusual things occurring in the industry that I would call out versus my several three decades or so in the industry. I think it’s pretty steady as she goes out there. Richard Close – Jefferies & Co. Okay. And then just a followup with respect to the guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. How much do you guys factor in the rise in unemployment and potentially people losing their insurance and access?
R. David Yost: Yeah, I think Richard when we gave our guidance from the beginning of the year. We assume that pretty slow market growth with 1% to 2% with that point and our 1% to 3% overall guidance and again I don’t think we've seen a great change to that, that assumed a slowdown that took an account the economic environment and as bad as the environment has been, it’s been pretty much what we expected to see this year. Richard Close – Jefferies & Co. Okay, thank you.
R. David Yost: You bet.
Michael N. Kilpatric: We will take one more question please, operator.
Operator: Thank you. And that will come from Harlan Sonderling with Columbia Management Advisors.
Harlan Sonderling: Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. My question is on the build up of cash and your willingness to look at acquisitions of the value-added services to which you refer. What are some of those value-added services that interest you if you can avoid being too specific?
R. David Yost: Well. It would be those kinds of things that would enhance our total offering primarily in the specialty business would probably would be where we would have the greatest opportunities and within the specialty businesses there are a lot of little niche businesses, one of the recent acquisitions that we made a year or so ago, you reflected that two years ago, reflected that. So that’s the area where we have the greatest, that’s the area where we have the greatest interest. We would not be opposed to regional wholesaler in our core space as well, and as the economic environment gets more challenging, we would not be surprised to see some of them come up for sales. So, we're keeping a close eye on the market, and it's one of the reasons where we are very careful with our cash, so we can respond very quickly if any opportunities arise.
Harlan Sonderling: And have you made any changes to your optimum balance sheet debt to capital mix?
Michael D. DiCandilo: No, Harlan. We have and I think the 30% to 35% being one of the criteria from a debt to total capital perspective continues to be what we think is right and so, we’ve made no changes.
Harlan Sonderling: Good luck shopping. Thank you.
R. David Yost: Okay. Thanks.
Michael D. DiCandilo: Thanks. And thank you everybody for joining us today. And now Dave Yost would like to make some final comments.
R. David Yost: Well. Again I just like to thank you for joining us. We continue to be very optimistic about our industry and the position in that industry that AmerisourceBergen plays with our key drivers being generics and our specialty distribution and services, as well as our high quality un-concentrated revenues. We look very forward to sharing with you our continued success in July when we announce our third quarter fiscal results. Thank you very much.
Michael D. DiCandilo: And thank you everyone. That ends the call. Operator.
