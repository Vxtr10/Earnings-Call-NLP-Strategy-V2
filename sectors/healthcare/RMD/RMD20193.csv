"Operator: Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2019 ResMed Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Julie and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Julie. Good afternoon and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's third quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. As Julie said, this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's earnings press release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Amy and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I will review top level financial results, some business highlights, and a few key milestones from the quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who is with me here in Sydney, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. Before I get into the details, I would like to discuss ResMed's long-term strategy and our goal to include $250 million lives in 2025. Driven by a number of macro change such as an aging population, the increasing impact of chronic disease, chronic healthcare costs and a move towards digital transformation in healthcare. We see very exciting opportunities for ResMed. Our goal is to empower people to live healthier lives outside of the hospital. Today there were a numerous pain points in existing care delivery models and in the quality of patient care that ResMed can address. You'll know healthcare costs are growing faster than GDP in many countries. And there aren't enough doctors to treat the people who need to be treated. When you couple that with the difficulty of getting the right care at the right time, delivering that health care in low cost setting and even further changes in challenges with interoperability, documentation, and clinical data availability.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $662.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 15%. Taking a closer look that geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our thousand U.S , Canada and Latin American countries with $350 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $232.3 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $191.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Mask and other sales were $168.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $155.2 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms a 3% increase. Masks and other sales were $77.1 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms a 12% increase. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales were increased by 6%. while masks and other sales increased by 13% over the prior year quarter.  Software-as-a-Service revenue for the third quarter was $79.9 million, an increase of 101% over the prior year quarter. This includes revenue from our Brightree healthcare and MatrixCare businesses. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measure adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, and purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare preferred revenue and tax related expenses associated with U.S tax reform. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles tax, related expenses associated with U.S tax reform and restructuring expenses. Weâ€™ve provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the March quarter was 59.2%. Excluding the MatrixCare purchase accounting in the third revenue adjustment, now gross margins for the march quarter was 59.3% compared to 58.2% during the same quarter in the prior year. And 59.1% in Q2 FY19. Compared to the prior year and our adjusted gross margin increased by 110 basis points predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. The MatrixCare acquisition and favorable product mix partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Excluding the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the MatrixCare acquisition was accretive to our gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for the reminder fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 FY gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $164.5 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 17%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.8% compared to the 25% that we reported in the prior year quarter.  Looking forward and subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be broadly in the range of 25% to the balance of fiscal year 2019. R&D expenses for the quarter were $47.6 million, an increase of $0.27 over the prior year quarter or in constant currency basis an increase of 32%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 6%, reflect the incremental investments across R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.2% compared with 6.3% in the prior year. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% of the balance of fiscal year 2019. Amortization of acquired intangibles $22.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 95% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense in the quarter was $12.8 million. Non-GAAP, GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $192 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. While non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $128.1 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.89, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.73. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the weaker Australian dollar relative to the U.S dollar which were partially offset by the weaker euro. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 23.6%. On a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%.,We estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 21% to 23%. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $139.6 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $15.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $41.8 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of 53 million. On January 7, 2019 we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health for consideration of $225 million net of cash acquired and that assumes a joint venture with Verily continued operations during the quarter and we recorded equity losses of $6 million in income statement in the March quarter associated with the joint venture. We expect to record approximately 7 million of equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2019, and also in fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Given the recent acquisition activity and interest rate movements, I would like to update you on our expected net interest expense. Our net interest expense in Q3 FY19 was $12 million, and going forward we expect to record quarterly net interest expense in the range of $12 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. At March 31 we have $1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $4.1 billion and net equity was $2 billion. Finally, in summary, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin is improving, supported by the contribution from recent set acquisitions and our ongoing efforts to drive  efficiencies as well as favorable product mix. Our operating costs remain well controlled even as we observed the impact of acquisitions. As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q3 non-GAAP operating profit, up 15% year-on-year. We're focused on driving solid operating results, while ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Thanks, Mick. We will now turn the call to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question and if you do have additional questions, youâ€™re free to return to the call queue. Julie, we're now ready to start the Q&A section.
Operator: Thank you.  Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is on the line with the question.
Michael Farrell: Sean, you might be on mute.
Sean Laaman: Yes, great. Hello. Can you hear me?
Michael Farrell: Yes, you need to start from the start, Sean. You were on mute, I think.
Sean Laaman: Yes, sure. Yes. Okay. Mick -- well, hope youâ€™re all well everybody. On the rest of world masks, so strong number there. Were you able to talk about or give us some granularity around your experience for the upgraded devices in France and Japan and sort of how much runway is there to go on the benefit on that resupply side of the equation?
Michael Farrell: Yes, it's a good question in terms of -- allow me to talk about France and Japan, what weâ€™ve done there. Look, clearly global revenue growth in masks was exceptional in the quarter, 13% constant currency globally. 13% in the U.S. Canada and Latin America and 12% across Europe, Asia and rest of world in constant currency terms. So weâ€™ve had probably 4 to 5 plus quarters of upgrades in France and similarly in Japan. And as we said in the prepared remarks and we said last quarter and the last number of quarters, we are going to be facing a headwind of the device sales in both France and Japan, although we're now through to get a modest positive on the rest of world devices this quarter. But it allows us through that upgrade of digital health assets in both France and Japan to now start interacting with patients and driving patient behavior through apps like myAir and with physicians through solutions like AirView and the whole Air Solutions portfolio. And so we believe there's long-term sustainable mask growth that we can achieve in both France and Japan that should help continue to grow out share which is quite high already in those geographies. But look, we are not done with it. We -- obviously, in the last five years, brought digital health in the United States and now to France and Japan with 120 other countries worldwide that we now need to start that opportunity on, but yes, it's certainly great growth in masks in the quarter off the back of digital health, but also off the back of some great mask launches.
Sean Laaman: Sure. Thanks, Mick. And just one follow-up. A lot of activity there with the integration of the software platforms. Just wondering though qualitatively or quantitatively if you could give us some description on some of the financial benefits of those, that integration process that we might see?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Sean, look we always think about that driving investment in digital health technology and it drives such good growth of the core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care devices. And as Iâ€™ve mentioned just now also growth of the core masks and accessories. We have a lot of internal models. Iâ€™m not prepared to share how those internal models of digital health technology are catalyzing growth of those areas thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m prepared to talk about is our public segmentation of the SaaS business which is powered by the same digital health technology capability. And that part of that portfolio grew a 101% including acquisitions. But as I said on the pro forma basis, it was growing at high single-digit range and we think over time we can optimize that digital health tech and that SaaS portfolio to grow in the low double-digit on a sustainable basis as we look at multiple years towards that 2025 strategy, we think thatâ€™s a big part of it. Thanks for your question, Sean.
Sean Laaman: Yes, thank you, Mick.
Operator: Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse is on the line with a question.
Gretel Janu: Hi. Thanks very much. So just on rest of world devices, would you be able to give a little bit more about the breakout in terms of the performance of Japan and France in the third quarter? And then just in terms of the other rest of world countries, were there any other surprises in results?
Michael Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Gretel. Look, I -- we donâ€™t -- we already breakout a lot of information when we say all the different categories we go down to, but Iâ€™m happy to talk -- put some color on to the Europe, Asia and rest of world countries. Look, as I mentioned in the prep remarks, it was a great expansion in France and Japan these last number of quarters. But that great expansion and extraordinarily high share that weâ€™ve achieved there now means that youâ€™re going to slow down in both  have already been upgraded on the device side. Look, yes, as we saw the total Europe, Asia, rest of world growth was in that sort of modest positive on the CC and slightly negative on the headline number the U.S dollars given currency movements. Look, we expect that part -- that aggregate portfolio to grow in that type of rate as we move forward. There will be some lumpiness up and down over time, but the device side of that portfolio is given -- a little up and down in Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world over the next number of quarters as I think we addressed last quarter and most of sell side analysts have put in there. But as we move forward and we start to lap those fleet upgrades, we will get back to what we are doing, which is core patient growth. That is very strong in both France and Japan and throughout the rest of the countries we have there. And thatâ€™s whatâ€™s the real determinant of long-term growth. How do we get 900 million people suffocating to realize they are suffocating and getting into the system talk to their doctor and get diagnosed and treated. And that flows need to be pretty steady in Europe, Asia and rest of the world. So, yes, there will be some lumpiness in device sales here as we left France and Japan, but we will get back to growth. But yes, -- so Iâ€™m not going to give detail on China, Germany and all the other countries until and when there's a digital health upside in one of those countries and then we will become material element and I look forward to doing that really.
Gretel Janu: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: David Low from J.P. Morgan is on the line with a question.
David Low: Thanks very much. If we could just start with the commentary around the Software-as-a-Service business. Mick, youâ€™re suggesting that they return to low double-digit growth is the medium-term or long-term aspiration. I was just wondering if you would talk a little bit to Brightree versus the long-term postacute care space? Would I be right in assuming that the long-term postacute care growth opportunity is quite a lot larger than Brightree just given how immature it is?
Michael Farrell: Yes, I think -- look, there's runway still ahead, David, in the core Brightree business of home medical equipment. There's just so many efficiencies that we can have their, but yes as you know as Iâ€™ve said, the quarter mid to high single-digit growth. I donâ€™t think we can get that path, even just a Brightree path to the high single digits and probably not brushing up and touching the low double-digit growth within that Brightree home medical equipment segment, because this is just so many efficiencies to gain. A little bit of market share again, weâ€™ve good market share. But it's more about bringing in modules the capabilities that take  away from our home medical equipment companies and bring such values that we can then share in some of that value creation. But, yes, look, the $1.5 billion addressable market includes many other out of hospital verticals. We are already playing in around seven of them and at scale at least through, like weâ€™re in home health and hospice at scale now. Iâ€™m really excited about the Brightree, HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare assets all being combined. And John Vanguard and his team out there in Minneapolis, I think theyâ€™re going to do a great job in that vertical, home health and hospice. And additionally that same team working in skilled nursing facilities where we already have a strong position, but a lot of runway for growth. I think one of the things that ResMed brings thatâ€™s unique is we're a strategic player and weâ€™re going to converting capabilities like cybersecurity, our management of AWS, Azure and all the cloud-based systems around managing that digital portfolio that we can bring superior value to it. But look, it's really a portfolio, Brightree will be a good part of that growth. MatrixCare will be a good part of that growth and weâ€™re looking to continue to grow as we empower that team. Roger has been doing a great job.
David Low: Great. Thanks very much for that. Just my other question, big picture the growth that we saw from ResMed, like in your traditional sleep business looks very strong across but devices and masks. I think we would hesitate or extrapolate that out in rest of world as well, if you want to pull out the impact in France and Japan. Just would like your thoughts on where the market growth is picking up, or whether you think this is being a large or significant contribution from market share guidance?
Michael Farrell: Yes, it's interesting, David. And youâ€™ve followed the same other companies that I did to try and track it. We got some really good market share data in some of that geographies and less good in others. Look, I look at out at this quarter we had constant currency growth of devices globally 6% and we had constant currency growth of masks of 13%. Traditionally, we say and I think it's still true that devices sort of growing in that mid-single digits and masks going at the high single-digits. So that would imply that we took some modest share in devices. Obviously, geographies outside France and Japan we already took the share there. And in masks, I think the N30i, the F30, we didn't even count any of the P30i, but that 13% growth is -- its clearly including some share growth as well. We love the game of innovating, small, quiet, more comfortable, more connected devices. It's a competitive game that, yes, we are winning more than weâ€™re losing. Thanks for your questions, David.
David Low: Thanks.
Operator: Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee is on the line with a question.
Andrew Goodsall: Good morning and thanks very much for taking my question. Just on Mobi, you haven't called that out separately, just if you could characterize any contribution or feedback around the quarter? And also your move to go direct-to-consumer with OEM for Mobi?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Andrew thanks for the question. As I said in the prep remarks, the whole POC category, even if we had a 100% share, we would struggle to be material to our business. We are starting from a very early stage, Mobi, weâ€™re just sort of flipping to a full product launch as we move forward. And as I said, weâ€™re very closely partnering with our home medical equipment provider customers. And what we are looking to do is find patients that qualify, and if they qualify for the reimbursement versus Medicare or private insurance, we are working with our HME customers to provide that lead, if you like that person who is in need of a POC and to have them provide great care for that person. Two of our competitors have been -- one of them for many years and one for a period of time, experimenting with models that completed the genre on that reimbursed business and going direct to patient. We have stayed away certainly from competing with our customers in the reimburse business in the United States. It's not our game and we have been doing that plan to do that. In the case that a person who wants to buy a device by cash, we are at quality in different models, we've been, in the way the two competitors are. I think it would be foolish not to take care of the ultimate customer who is a patient, who needs when two other players in the market are doing that. But it's very early days in this. Iâ€™m going to say that the opportunities that is huge for us and we think of it as a longitudinal play across COPD. POC is an interesting part of a big journey of a COPD patient. We want to talk to the patient in stage 1, stage 2 through digital health and inhalers. Thatâ€™s about 80% plus of the cost of the COPD patient is in the pharmaceutical side. So Propeller Health is the one that we should be talking about as a material element. I think with POC, noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, we are already in that. And it's exciting, but it's really that long-term play of the patient through digital applications  of hospital, to keep them happy, so that their physician's happy, that the health insurance company is happy, that the caregiver, everyone is happy and also that our customers are under and  equipment customers can be happy. As a reimbursed patient, we want to take care of it.
Andrew Goodsall: Very good. Thank you. And just my follow up, just obviously GM, half of that was -- you attribute to metrics. The other half I presume is predominantly mixed with the higher growth in the U.S?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, hi, Andrew. It's Brett. The -- it's probably -- there is meaningful impact probably from the some production efficiencies in Q1 efficiency  that weâ€™re driving for maybe would like 30, to add. And then obviously product mix was favorable, and that was a meaningful impact on that as well.
Andrew Goodsall: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Michael Farrell: Thanks for your questions, Andrew.
Operator: David Bailey from Macquarie, is on the line with quarter question.
David Bailey: Hey, good morning. Just a quick one for me.  up on the gross margin, just wonder if you can quantify the impact to currency on gross margin on a year-on-year basis.
Michael Farrell: Yes, year-on-year was favorable around COPD POC license points. And in -- at a sequentially it was basically pretty negligible.
David Bailey: On the context of the 50 basis points your refer to early are you probably looking around 10% -- 10 basis points organic gross margin expansion with the year-on-year. Excluding currency?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, and actually on currency, it's actually pretty negligible on both actually. If I look at year-on-year, correct that. It's pretty eligible . And really  because we still  to see the all these are real types of  I would call for the . And lastly I said .
David Bailey: Okay. Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yes.
Operator: Saul Hadassin from UBS is on the line with a question,
Saul Hadassin: Thanks. Good morning. Just one question from me. Mick, the U.S. masks growth rate  ahead of market growth again. Can you talk to how much of that is resupply growth, an acceleration in resupply as opposed to success on new product launches. I mean, we have the impression that masks that redeployed the vast majority of your U.S  you talk to what youâ€™re seeing in the dynamic between resupply growth versus share shift that would be great.
Michael Farrell: Yes, thatâ€™s a great question. We have Jim Hollingshead, the Head of our Global Sleep business on the line. Jim, you want to talk to as much cover you can gave on U.S growth organic etcetera.
Michael Farrell: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mick, and thanks for your question, Saul. I think the answer is both in. We are seeing very strong results of resupply and weâ€™ve seen that over the last several quarters as more and more of our HME customers have adopted automated resupply solutions. So that continue to be very strong. return results for us and for customers with the new products have also -- all gotten off to a terrific start. F30 is out of the gate very strong, N30i has a terrific patient preference and is doing very, very well and early result from P30 are also extremely encouraging. So I think we are getting both organic growth and we are taking some share in this space, but weâ€™re also enjoying very good results for the resupply.
Saul Hadassin: Thank you.
Operator: Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on the line with a question.
Joanne Wuensch: Good afternoon everybody and thank you for this quarter after the last quarter experience. Anyway two quick questions. What was the total acquisition revenue impact on the fiscal year third quarter. And then the second question is how do we think about operating leverage in the coming quarters and maybe even for next year? Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Well, I will jump to the operating leverage, I will hand to Brett to talk about sort of organic versus acquisition driven growth. But look Joanne as weâ€™ve been -- as you and other sell-side analysts have challenged us, that is, one is the ongoing leverage. And it's really our challenge to ourselves to ensure that we can achieve ongoing leverage and I think weâ€™ve had a good performance in the last number of quarters to that end. The operating programs, the business excellence programs, we put in place the drive with  manufacturing team, the  advanced manufacturing teams that I'm here on site with this week are all doing excellent work in that. Our commercial teams and looking at how to use digital health technology for the social media marketing versus old-school paper and television, really pushing the envelope of how we drive business excellence across all that functions in all our business verticals. It's something that we think is sustainable for the medium to long-term. But it's a game that never stopped throughout the game of continuous improvement and Brett, do you want to have a little discussion as to whatâ€™s organic versus inorganic growth in the quarter.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, Joanne, youâ€™re talking on the SaaS side?
Joanne Wuensch: A number of acquisition in the last 90 to 180 days, , MatrixCare, Propeller, et cetera. Just I'm trying to piece through where all that came from.
Brett Sandercock: Yes if you look at -- on a group basis, if you look at -- growth you exclude the acquisitions, we grew at around the 8% mark constant currency. I think a good way to look at it, Joanne, is that masks -- the devices and masks and accessories -- none of those acquisitions came with us. So if you think of device growth year-on-year constant currency at 6% and masks and accessories growth year-on-year 10%, that gives you an idea for absolute core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. Excluding all acquisition about -- that happened.
Joanne Wuensch: Thank you very much.
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Joanne.
Operator:  Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking the question. For my question, I want to focus a little bit on Brightree and some of the strategic changes may be that your guys trying to make to accelerate revenue there. And part of that is really the number of recent product and program launches that you have. So how should we view the typical sales cycle for some of these new product launches? Is it six months, nine months? And then can you give us a sense of where that revenue growth is going to come from new users versus existing accounts?
Michael Farrell: Great question, Margaret. I'm going to hand that to Rob Douglas, Chief operating Officer.
Rob Douglas: Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Margaret. Margaret, you know that Brightree is recurring revenue model. So we compete on booking and that then reflect in recurring revenue on the U.S. So we do have a view of that. And as we talked about, we had headwinds around a little bit of consolidation in the industry. Our approach to that has been really improve modules on it and weâ€™re really happy with the way the new Brightree modules are going, including some of the analytics offerings and certainly some of the direct patient engagement offering in Brightree. Weâ€™ve got the team really focused on driving those offerings in the market. And then even on a longer term basis, we've got the team working on additional modules and development. So we are very confident that that Brightree growth will continue as it did in this quarter. We saw a decent improvement in that and we are confident that will continue.
Margaret Kaczor: Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Thanks for the question, Margaret.
Operator: John Deakin-Bell from Citi is on the line with a question.
John Deakin-Bell: My question is just around Propeller. Last quarter you said that was going to be $0.02 to $0.03% dilutive third quarter for some time. Can you just confirm that that is the case in this quarter? And just give us an update on the trajectory of that -- of the losses over the next year or two?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Brett, do you want to talk to the losses â€¦?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, Sure, John. Yes, so I can confirm that it was in the $0.02 to $0.03 range for this quarter. And I guess for the next little while next few quarters I think it will around that sort of level.
John Deakin-Bell: That's fine. I mean, like for the whole of FY '20 is that -- are we talking about that length of time?
Brett Sandercock: I mean I don't want to make progress that sort of long-term predictions like that on Propeller but I think for the next few quarters it will be around that level.
Michael Farrell: The real question, John, is where that goes from down a penny to up a penny is the sales cycle of Propeller. So Propeller, as we said on the prepared remarks, are working with Orion in Finland, sort of niche pharmaceutical company. Its public that the Propeller are working with some very large pharmaceutical companies and some of them don't want us to talk about, some of them are in the archive. But if anyone of these pilots starts to commercialize, that stuff -- and they are comfortable for us talking about that publicly, how customer is, we will update you on that. And this will be very quickly from dilutive to accretive in a heartbeat, but that's obviously the play. It's a medium to long term play and we are not calling the date, the time or the hour or the quarter that, that happens. But thatâ€™s what the investments are around, so thatâ€™s where it like sort of as we start to get out there, those changes may happen. And so for the short term,  things down. For the long-term, incredibly excited for COPD patients to get better Digital Healthcare.
John Deakin-Bell: Right. Good color. Thanks for that.
Operator: Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning, gentleman. I just got another question on your SaaS business. And you mentioned previously about the home health market and Brightree and MatrixCare. Can you actually shed some color on how we should be thinking about the revenue synergies in the -- in your SaaS business with Brightree and MatrixCare and also on HEALTHCAREfirst?
Michael Farrell: Yes, it's a good question. And the combination of those businesses, there is a number of factors. I mean, sort of basic one is that we can combine our digital health capabilities, our cyber security, cloud-based management and management team and sort of the economies of scale managing across those multiple portfolio. The big upside is that there are a number of customers, may be many thousands of customers out at hospital healthcare, that operate in multiple cities. They have a skilled nursing facility. They also have a hospice and maybe also a home health. And a lot of the players out there are small and or niche players in -- as in terms of our competitors in the SaaS space and they serve one or maybe two of those verticals. I think as ResMed now serves seven verticals, we are able to have frictionless or seamless moment of an aging person from care setting to care setting. That's good for them. It's good for the family. It's good for the health care system. It's good for the insurance company and its good for the customer. The person who is signing us on a per year to per month basis. And so thatâ€™s the real upside. The synergies is on the backside, on the backend of the infrastructure, but there is also incredible synergies for the customer in ResMed being an offering that goes across those. And so we are actually  Healthcare first, allow us to really put it all under one umbrella and bring that value to the customer.
Lyanne Harrison: Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Thanks for your question, Lyanne.
Operator: Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question.
Chris Cooper: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Most have been asked, but perhaps if I may probably just ask one on the growth opportunity in POC since you mentioned that. Just curious if you could share your thoughts, please on how big you believe that our addressable market might be, and also what you see is a current market growth? I know you expect to outperform that through share gains, but if you could just give some sense of how big that market is and how quickly you believe it's growing right now, that would be helpful for us. Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Yes, Chris, as I said in the prep remarks, it's going to take a long time for POC to get material versus other -- $2 billion plus franchise, but it is exciting as kind of the  top line. Rob, do you want to give a little more data as to the addressable market and/or to that share.
Rob Douglas: Sure. Weâ€™ve talked about addressable market over the years saying that $ 3million to -$4 million range. But it's actually changing a lot because as weâ€™ve talked about, POCs are a disruptive play to other forms of oxygen delivery. But in order for that disruption to really play out there are a few generations of technology needed. But we could see a strong market growth in that market and particularly as we introduce connected solutions and better management of products and better really management of patients. So long-term we see a lot of opportunity in growing that market, but as Mick has said in the short-term, it's going to take a long-term to be material, particularly given the growth rates of our other businesses. And we are happy with our current programs. We are really focusing on learning and the best way to support patients in the market and the best way to use the capabilities of our existing partners throughout in the market.
Chris Cooper: Got it. Thanks. Just one very quick follow-up. Just on the masks side, if you were to apportion or rank their contribution that you would expect from the F30, the M30i and the P30i, over the next few quarters could just give us some sense of how big you expect each of them to be relative to one another.
Michael Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, we don't go into that level of detail around new masks set up versus existing or new mask growth. But what I can tell you in terms of color is we are very excited about the initial performance of the N30i and the F30. They have shot out of the gates beautifully. The P30i wasnâ€™t even in the quarter which is launched last month. Iâ€™m looking forward to opening the packet and using it myself. And I can't wait to see many, many, many others do the same. But yes, we won't that right out, but I can tell I this growth in the quarter of 13% constant currency in masks and accessories wasn't a one timer. I think we have the ability to continue to grow pretty strongly with this really strong portfolio we have.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick for closing comments.
