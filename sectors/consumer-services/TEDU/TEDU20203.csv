Nancy Sun:  Thanks you, Yongji. Hello everyone. Nice to meet all of you again and I'm going to present you with information regarding our operation performance in the third quarter of this year. First of all, I would like to update you the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. In July and August, except for Beijing, Harbin, and Dalian, our adult and the K-12 offline 2C learning centers have resumed their in class session. Starting from September, the direct impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our learning centers in all cities in China, including Beijing, Harbin, and Dalian has basically faded out. Next, please let me share with you some operational information of our adult education business. As I have mentioned in the prior earning release conference, our operational strategy for adult education business is profit maximization. In the past more than one year, we have been optimizing our operational efficiency. Despite that our operations scale have shrunk, the profitability of our adult education has been elevating. Adult education business returned to be profitable in the third quarter of this year. The gross margin increased from 70%, in the third quarter of last year to 71.3% in the same period of this year, increased by 1.3%. Net revenue, in the third quarter of this year decreased by 38.8% to RMB331.2 million, compared to net revenue in the same period of last year. Cost of revenue in the third quarter of this year decreased, by 41.6% to RMB95 million, compared to cost revenue, in the same period of last year. Students enrollment decreased by 29.4%, from 54,400 in the third quarter of last year to 38,400, in the same period of this year. The number of new students recruited, decreased by 45.3% to 15,100, in the third quarter of this year, compared to the number of new students recruited, in the same period of last year. The decrease was mainly due to the significant decrease in number of learning centers. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to execute most of our summer vacation student recruitment activities. The average of six months and three months post-course job placement rate were 89% and 82% respectively. By the end of September 30, 2020, the three month post-course job placement rate for most of the students who attended our online lessons during the COVID-19 pandemic period was 74%. Our online tutoring experience and the capability, which has been accumulated for more than 18 years, can provide a very solid foundation for our future adult education business development.
Kelvin Lau: Thank you, Nancy. Now, I would like to take you through the third quarter of 2020 financial highlights. Total net revenues decreased by 5.8% to RMB620.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 from RMB659.2 million in the same period of 2019. Net revenue from adult education business decreased by 38.8% to RMB 331.2 million in the third quarter of 2020 from RMB541.5 million in the same period of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decline in student enrollments of adult education by 29.4%, from 54,400 in the third quarter of 2019 to 38,400 in the same period of 2020. Net revenues from K-12 education business increased by 146% to RMB 289.6 million in the third quarter of 2020, from RMB117.7 million in the same period of 2019.
