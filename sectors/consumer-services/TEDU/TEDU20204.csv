Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the utility and office fees declined as our employees worked from home, and the social security fees were exempted due to the preferential policies enacted by the government.

This guidance is based on the current market conditions and reflects the company's current and preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions, which are subject to change, particularly as to the potential impact of COVID-19 on the economy in China and elsewhere in the world. This concludes my financial highlights section. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Certainly.  Thank you.
Kelvin Lau: Hey operator. Our CEO, Mr. Sun is already back to the office. He wants to speak a little bit, okay.
Yongji Sun: 
Operator: So please go ahead. We have no questions at this point of time. Please go ahead.
Yongji Sun:  So, Hello everyone. My name is Yongji Sun, I'm the CEO of Tarena International, Incorporated. So sorry, first of all, I want to say sorry, because I was caught in a traffic jam. So, I was late for a conference call. But I believe that you guys are very excited after hearing our SVP, Nancy, and Kelvin, our CFO’s his words. So, we do have a very promising Q4 in 2020 and we do have very promising figures in the 2024 year. So, the time is quite precious here. If you guys have any questions. You're welcome to ask your question and we will answer your question.
Operator: Thank you very much. We have a question on the line. So, the first question comes from the line of  Management. Please go ahead. Excuse me , your line is open. You can ask your question now. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst:  So we’re not in a proper position to comment, I mean the progress or the – expectation of the  process, so any progress or any development in terms of the – related to the  we will make the announcement and  or to inform everybody, not proper place to  about the  in this conference call.
Yongji Sun: Okay, so previously, the question was about the Q4 financials and the total financials. It seems that Tarena have scored very positive Q4 numbers. However, overall speaking Tarena are still in a loss position. So, I was just wondering whether we can achieve the earning or monthly profitability like our management have said before, and our SVP, Ms. Nancy has said, I've answered the question that we do have a very positive earnings for our adults business in Q4, and our revenues for K-12 business is very exciting. And we will continue our rather conservative strategies going forward because the market is developing very fast.  We don't want to lose our market shares. Based on the Q3 numbers, we can see that our adult business figures and our revenues for K-12 business in the Q4 of 2020 is quite promising and excluding the factors such as COVID-19. From July to December in 2020, we do see 96% of revenue growth for our K-12 business, compared with the second half of 2019. So that is a huge opportunity for us. We don't want to miss the opportunity. And we do have very positive cash revenue. So, in the future, we will continue to focus on cash revenue increase and our increase of cost or decrease of COGS per acquisition.
Unidentified Analyst:  So, this is the last question for our conference call, and it is a question about K-12 business or children education business, so just asking what is the strategy for K-12 this year? Do we want to expand our learning centers? And if we want to expand our sites, that means we need more money? How to solve that issue?
Nancy Sun:  Okay. So, to answer your first question, we were in this market since 2015. And over the past three years from 2017, 2018, and 2019, we've witnessed a very fast development for Tarena International. And although there was a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we do have positive financials in 2020. And in 2021, we want to continue our fast development based on a very sound structure, meaning that we will continue to rely on our very stable operating structure. We will continue to enhance and adjust our organization power. We believe that we want to be a powerhouse rather than a big house. And in 2021, we will continue to strengthen our services, our word of mouth referrals, our innovative operating methods, and our value-added structures. So, we don't have any new plans to build new sites in Q1 of 2021.
Unidentified Analyst: 
Kelvin Lau: No question.
Operator: Thank you.  Thank you. As there are no further questions, I would like to hand the call back to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Amanda Wang: Okay, thank you, operator. If there's no further questions at present, we would like to conclude by thanking everyone for joining our conference call.
