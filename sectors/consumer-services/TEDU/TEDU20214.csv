Nancy Ying Sun: Thank you, Sylvia, and thanks to all the shareholders to participate in our call. Thank you very much for your attention and your support. We are pleased to announce Tarena's results for the fourth quarter of 2021. We are delighted to see that in the fourth quarter of 2021 both of our childhood & adolescent quality education and adult professional education businesses reached their highest amount of quarterly cash collection during the year of 2021. As a result, our net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2021 achieved RMB129.5 million, and our total cash and cash equivalent balance increased to RMB430.4 million as of December 31, 2021. At the same time, we are glad to see that our total net revenues were RMB655.3 million, which was higher than the guidance we gave in the last quarter. The total net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by 0.8% as compared to the total net revenues of RMB650.3 million in the same period of last year, and increased by 6.5% as compared to the total net revenue of RMB615.2 million in the third quarter of 2021.

Operating margin improved by 3.9% to 9.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 13.1% in the same period of 2020. Net loss after deducting the income tax expense of RMB125.7 million was RMB182.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in income tax expenses was mainly because we’ve made appropriate provision allowance against the deferred income tax assets, which was derived from the utilized tax loss as it was more likely than not that the unutilized tax loss will not be utilized within the 5-year deduction period. Meanwhile, the number of total headcounts decreased by 1.7% to 10,009 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 10,181 in the same period of last year. The productivity per capita on an annual basis increased by 37.1% and to RMB236,000 in 2021 from RMB172,000 in 2020. Our total revenues increased by 25.7% to RMB2,386.5 million in 2021 from RMB1,897.9 million in 2020. In 2021 as we have achieved a steady growth in net revenues and have implemented effective measures to control costs and expenses, and our operating loss decreased significantly by 54.2% to RMB369.1 million in 2021 from RMB806.4 million in 2020.

Sylvia Yang: Sorry, Amber , could you please wait a second.
Operator: Certainly. 
Nancy Ying Sun: So, this is Nancy. And first of all, I'd like to thank all of our investors for joining the call Actually, we did quite well in 2021, even though there are sporadic fluctuations and occurrence of COVID-19, but we still achieved good growth for our two business i.e., the childhood & adolescent quality education business as well as very good growth for our -- good performance for our adult professional education business throughout 2021. In the future, we will continue to optimize our business structure, always trying to lower the cost, and we are very confident that we can achieve a very healthy and sound growth for our two businesses in 2022. Okay. So, in 2022, we will continue to improve our operational efficiency and our core goal is to make profits, and our overall strategy, our overall objective is to achieve long-term sustainable development, even though that our adolescent & childhood business are in different stage than our adult professional education business. So that is why we have different strategies for these two businesses. For example, for our childhood & adolescent quality education business, that's been going on for more than 6 years. And right now, what we are focusing on is to achieve a profitable business model. And in the Q4 of 2021, we're already making profit for our childhood & adolescent quality education business. And we are in the -- going forward, we will continue to improve our business development. By the way, the business has already developed for our childhood & adolescent business, and we have already achieved a very significant loss reduction for this business. And judging from the record of our January in 2022, we are already making profits for our childhood & adolescent business. And in the future, we will continue to hone in our childhood & adolescent quality education business. Regarding our adult professional education business, it is a business that's going on for more than 20 years. It enjoys very mature business model. And going forward, we will continue to optimize our adult business structure, continue to improve our capability to improve its profits, and by the end of 2024, even though that the number of learning centers have been reduced by four by the end of Q4 of 2021, we still can achieve a positive revenue throughout the year for our adult business as well as significant improve of improvement of our gross profit and the improvement of revenue per single learning center and judging by the record of our January performance in 2022, the gross profit of our adult professional education business reached around 70% and the profitable level reached around 30%. And the revenue guidance that we gave you based on the Q1 of 2022 is significantly higher than the same period of last year. And even though the performance of Q1 in 2022 was slightly impacted by the China's Lunar New Year happened in February, which was quite seasonal. We are fully prepared to welcome other breakthroughs. For example, breakthroughs of our net revenue throughout the year in 2022 because we have already achieved a very sound and sustainable growth model for our two business. So, I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your long-term attention as well as your patience and your support. Just trying to ask are there any other questions?
Operator:  We have a question from Dave . Please go ahead. Please ask your question, Dave.
Unidentified Analyst: So, thank you very much for that presentation. First off, I want to congratulate on Tarena's good performance in the Q4 of 2021, which is quite commendable. My question is regarding the rebound of COVID-19 due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 in Beijing, yet again this year, a lot of off-campus training institutes have been caught off and shut down. So, will this impact our offline learning centers?
Nancy Ying Sun: So, thank you for that question. And this is Nancy, the CEO of Tarena International Incorporated. And thank you very much for that question because it is quite normal that we see this rebound of COVID-19, and we only need to look at it from a -- with a detached mind and to look at it as a normal thing going on in China, in Beijing. And for us, we are an education company -- educational company, and we are providing good educational products as well as high-quality education service. So, no matter what's going on in the world in the society, we still need to provide high-quality service for the sustainable growth of our kids and for our adults. So that is why the core -- the core competitive edge for Tarena has always been a sound and sustainable growth model. So, we are very fortunate that our -- all of our business, our adult business as well as our childhood & adolescent business can be transferred online because for programming education course, it is in its nature that it can be top online. So let me dive a little deeper about the advantage of our curriculum. First off, we've been doing OMO, the Online-Merge-Offline online programming training for around 16 years. We have cumulated a lot of experience in this regard. During the pandemic in 2020, our adult professional education business offline was totally transferred to online and with very good and very positive feedback from our students and also we can maintain a very stable job placement rate. So far, 80% of our offline childhood and adolescent programming course has been transferred to online, and this rate has continued, except for our robotic training course. We also have already come up with a very effective transfer plan to transfer our offline robotic course to online. Meanwhile, we also will abide by the regulations of China. We also know that because the Chinese government has issued a policy to shut down a lot of schools and try to shut off a lot of off-campus training institutes. On March 15, the Education Bureau of Beijing municipal government has also released another document titled The 2022 Key Point for Informatization and Cybersecurity for the Education in Beijing. So, this documents for this policy encourages off-campus institutions to come up with Online-Merge-Offline learning products to deliver good learning practice and good high-quality learning for the students. Our childhood & adolescent quality education business can be taught either offline or online, and I think that this will be our core competitiveness in the future. And also in the future, where artificial intelligence will be the mainstay of education. So, I think that the COVID-19 is like a double-edge sword. It is both an opportunity, but also a challenge for us. We are fully capable to cope with the impact of COVID-19, and we are very confident that we will enjoy better performance in the future. And to sum up, I want to thank you for this question again. Thank you.
Operator:  We don't have any other question at the moment. Presenters, please continue.
Sylvia Yang: Thank you, Amber. If there are no further questions as for yet, we would like to conclude by thanking everyone for joining our conference call.
