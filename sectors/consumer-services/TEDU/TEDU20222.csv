And our headcount decreased by 11.8%. Secondly, optimizing spending on marketing and sales and keeping our focus to operational excellence, which is, through focusing on quality of content, delivery and services. We continue to generate more word-of-mouth referral enrollments and higher lifetime value of our students. And finally, include the efficiency and streamlined OMO strategies further helped with overall operational efficiency, resulting in lower General and Administrative expanding, while a one-time provision for the expected settlement of a cost action partially resulted in an increase in G&A expense in the second quarter, we expect G&A to stay at a low level in next few quarters.
