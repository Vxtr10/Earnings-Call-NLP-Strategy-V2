The number of new contracted students, including new registered students and renewal students increased by 21.0% from 31,400 in 2020 Q3 to 38,000 in 2021 Q3.  Net revenues from adult professional education business dropped by 14.7% from RMB331.2 million in 2020 Q3 to RMB282.6 million in 2021 Q3. This is largely due to the number of student enrollments dropped by 13.0% from 38,400 in 2020 Q3 to 33,400 in 2021 Q3. However, we have seen an increase of 7.4% in number of student enrollments as compared to the student enrollment of 31,100 in 2021 Q2.  In the first three quarters of 2021, we have enacted and implemented a series of effective policies and measures to minimize the negative impact from the adverse weather conditions and COVID-19 pandemic on our business through continuous efforts in optimizing the organizational structure, improving operational management efficiency and controlling cost and expenses. We have only seen a slight increase in our total cost of revenues and operating expense by 3.6% to RMB2,040.0 million in the first three quarters of 2021 from RMB1,968.9 million in the same period of 2020 on the premise that our student enrollment are increasing.

Net loss in the first three quarters of 2021 was RMB293.2 million, which was 56.7% less than the net loss of RMB676.5 million in the same period of 2020. This was mainly due to the significant increase in total net revenues and the continued implementation of effective optimization and management of cost and expenses in the first three quarters of this year.  Our total number of employees rose by 4.2% from 9,905 at the end of 2020 Q3 to 10,321 at the end of 2021 Q3. The production capacity per capita increased by 47.0% to about RMB 169,000 in the first three quarters of 2021 from about RMB115,000 in the same period of last year.  In 2021, we continue to focus on our core strategy of improving the operational and management efficiency of our adult professional education learning center. Since September 30, 2020, we have stopped the operation of six underperforming adult professional education learning centers, and this lead to in a decline in number of student enrollments by 8.9% to 55,400 in the first three quarters of 2021 as compared to the number of student enrollments in the same period of last year. However, net revenues per single learning center increased by 22.7% to about RMB8.15 million in the first three quarters of 2021 from about RMB6.64 million in of 2020.  So the number of childhood and adolescent quality education learning centers has expanded from 236 at the end of 2020 Q3 to 238 at the end of 2021 Q3. The number of student enrollments per single learning center increased from 543 in the first three quarters of last year to 689 in the same period of 2021. Net revenues per single learning center rose by 86.3% from about RMB2.04 million in the first three quarters of last year to about RMB3.80 million in the same period of 2021.  Next, I will report and share with you the status of our operations in 2021 Q3.  During 2021 Q3, the sporadic occurrence of severe weathers and COVID-19 cases have brought short-term impacts to some areas in China, which were mainly manifested in the suspicion of offline operations of some learning centers in certain cities, including Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Changsha and Wuhan City and et cetera. Our entire team has taken prompt and effective action. For example, we take some offline teaching to online delivery, up to now the negative impacts on our operations have been mostly eliminated.

We have also made good progress in optimizing the structure of operating expenses. Our operation teams have increased the percentage of new student recruitment from underground promotion in university and word of mouth promotional activities resulting in a 10.2% reduction in selling expenses in 2021 Q3 as compared to the selling expenses in same period of 2020.  Based on our strong teaching team and job placement service system, the six month post-course job placement rate of our students remain about 90% in 2021 Q3, a good security of job placement is the foundation for the sustainable growth of our business.

This concludes my financial highlights section. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Operator:  Your first question comes from the line of . Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you for the strong operating performance in 2021. It’s good to see. I just have two main questions. The first is, in prior years you guys were repurchasing stock, quite meaningfully. Is there any consideration given where things are trading right now to launch a share repurchase plan? And the second question is, do you have any guidance on when you expect to reach breakeven and does the company have sufficient liquidity to get there? Thank you. 
Kelvin Lau: Thank you. Okay, I’m going to answer your first question. This is a very good question. Thank you. Regarding the NAV purchase share – repurchase plan I think up to now, we still haven’t have any share repurchased plan on the table for discussion. I think it’s one of the good options for us. Once we have any decision on any share repurchased plan, we have appropriate announcement up to now, at least at this moment, we don’t have any share with special trail on the table. Thank you. Nancy is going to answer your second question.
Nancy Ying Sun:  So just I’ll try to answer your second question first. Let me rephrase your question. You’re asking about when can we breakeven, and also your question is also about our current water status call of our liquidity, right?
Unidentified Analyst: Correct. Yeah.
Nancy Ying Sun:  Well, first of all, let me say that to breakeven as soon as possible, this has always been the priority of the management.  So, because we have a very stable adult information technology education business, and we are looking at further improve our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency as well as improving our profitability.  So actually, we are doing quite good in several fronts. For example one of our business is called the childhood & adolescent quality education business, our kid business, which also is another stream of revenue for us. It is a new business actually this is a business in China starting in 2017, we have been always the top leader in terms of the adolescent & childhood quality education business. And at the beginning of this year, we tried to explore new opportunities to create new products and new services. And now we can say that we are the veteran, or we are very experienced in this industry, starting last year, we began to think about how can we improve profitability for this business. And by that first, we need to enroll more students in the classroom. We need to promote more service and the more business. And also we provided a series of different short-term campus-based learning opportunities for those students to choose from. Those are some of the methods that we adopted to improve profitability for this business.  So from those efforts, as you can see that we try our best to continue to improve our revenue, very steady way, and looking to the future in order to improve the profitability of all of our business, we need to continue to iterate and optimize our business models, decrease costs, and optimize our expenditure. We actually made a lot of breakthroughs, which I’m very happy to share with you. For example, in the third quarter, we have a restructure our organization structure. For example, we have restructure our group mid platform, and we will continue to do that in the future. In the meantime, we will continue to lower our costs perfect, our expenditure in order to improve profitability of this business.  Thirdly, I want to say that one of our core competitive edges is offline acquisition expenditure as well as offline centers operation. And we have accumulated a lot of good experience in terms of offline acquisition, and we will continue to do that and we will continue to leverage this competitive edge in the future in order to lower the cost, improve our expenditure structure. So as to improve our profitability  And so lastly, I want to say that we will continue to lower the cost to perfect our expenditure because right now our cash revenue, as you can see are increasing, they are increasing a lot. So that is – that means our operational liquidity right now is in a very positive situation. And this will be our top priority for the future month.  In addition, our operation management team is continuing to find other financing methods.
