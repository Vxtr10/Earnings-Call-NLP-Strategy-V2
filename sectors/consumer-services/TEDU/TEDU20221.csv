Nancy Ying Sun:  I am delighted to announce the result of Tarena for the first quarter of 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, we ended our losses and achieved a net income. This marked the beginning of a healthy operating trajectory of our business. Our net income reached RMB 27.1 million, operating income reached RMB 28.6 million, and operating margin reached 4.6%. Even under the impact of seasonal factors of the Chinese New Year, our cash balance remained relatively well preserved at RMB 416.4 million. Looking back at the first quarter of 2021, we had net loss of RMB 121.9 million, operating loss of RMB 129.5 million and operating margin of minus 24.3%.  We were able to accomplish these operational results, mainly because we have been adopting and executing our sound continuous strategies effectively and efficiently, both adult professional education and telco and adolescent quality education businesses achieved revenue growth and continued cost reduction in the first quarter of 2022.  On the one hand, our net revenues in the first quarter of this year was RMB 623.5 million, which was higher than the revenue guidance we gave in the previous quarter and was 16.8% higher than the net revenues of RMB 533.8 million in the same period of 2021. Among them, we are glad to see that the adult professional education business renewed year-on-year growth of 5.5%. The child and adolescent quality education business has seen positive year-over-year growth for seven consecutive quarters since the outbreak of the pandemic with a 27.2% year-over-year increase in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in net revenues led to the increment of productivity per capita by 22.1% from about RMB 52,000 in the same period last year to about RMB 64,000 in the first quarter of 2022.  On the other hand, our long-term adherence to the strategies of improving operational efficiency and reducing costs has enabled us to reduce our cost of revenues and operating expenses by 10.3% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021.  In the first quarter of 2022, our gross profit reached RMB 358.9 million, an increase of 43.6% compared to RMB 249.9 million in the same period of last year, with gross margin increased by 10.8 percentage points to 57.6%.

The number of students enrollments in the first quarter of 2022 was 29,300, down 5.5% from 31,000 in the same period of 2021. Despite of the decrease in the number of student enrollments, net revenue reached RMB 269.6 million in the first quarter of 2022, up 5.5% from RMB 255.5 million in the same period of 2021. This was mainly attributable to the adoption of our product strategy of exploring the whole life cycle of users and adding more short-term courses, which attracted students to make repeated enrollments in different courses and thus increase our revenue.  We continue to make great progress in managing and controlling the cost of revenues and operating expenses which were 15.0% lower and that in the same period in 2021.  The gross profit of adult professional education business in the fourth quarter of 2022 was RMB 184.2 million, up 20.8% from RMB 152.5 million in the same period of 2021. The gross margin was 68.3%, up 8.6 percentage points from 59.7% in the same period of 2021.

In the first quarter of 2022, the 6-month post-graduate job placement rate remained at over 90%. Our long-term, stable tutoring quality and good job placement results have provided strong evidence to demonstrate that our adult professional education business has the ability to deliver high-quality products and services in the market.  Next, I would like to introduce our childhood and adolescent quality education business.  In the first quarter of 2022, the net revenue from childhood & adolescent quality education business was RMB 363.9 million, up 27.2% compared to RMB 278.3 million in the same period of 2021.

This concludes my financial highlights section. Operator, we are ready - we are ready for questions...
Operator: Thank you, management.  Our first question comes from Dave. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst:  So there's a question from the gentleman. First of all, congratulations to Tarena's outstanding performance in the first quarter, making net gains. And as we all know that normally, the first quarter in China's market would always be an off-season for the education industry. So what are the breakthroughs, but what were the breakthroughs made by Tarena in this respect? And the lastly answer is that, first, thank you very much. Indeed, the first quarter in China market is always an off-season for education business because we have the Lunar China New Year happened in January. However, we did make a lot of breakthroughs in terms of business operations. And let me give you two- which can be divided into two categories.
Unidentified Company Representative:  And the first thing is that our gain comes from the decreasing or shall we say, the continuous decreasing of the cost, as well as the expenses all the way since last year. That serves as a solid foundation for us to achieve gains.
Unidentified Analyst:  
Unidentified Company Representative: And to our delight, since Q1 of this year, we have seen a positive growth rate for our adult professional education business, as well as our childhood and adolescent and quality education business. And by the way, our childhood and adolescent quality education business has been increasing for seven consecutive quarters.
Unidentified Analyst: 
Unidentified Company Representative: By the way, our adult professional education started to increase its income as well as profit since Q1 of this year. So let me break it down. What is - what would be the reason for the positive growth for our childhood and adolescent quality education business as well as our adult professional education business. First of all, let's talk about childhood and adolescents. Actually, the increase and the positive growth rate for our childhood and adolescent quality education business is attributable to our high-quality products as well as services, which resulted in high renewal and retention rate. For our adult professional education business, it is also attributable to our long-term digging for the lifetime value of our users, which leads to more repurchase rate and better satisfaction, and that serves as the foundation for so many breakthroughs that have been made for our adult professional education...
Unidentified Analyst: 
Unidentified Company Representative: So to sum up, all of our breakthroughs and gains are indispensable with the satisfaction rate of our customers and users. So here on behalf of the management, I would like to send our heartfelt appreciation to the continued focus and attention paid by our investors. We know that you guys want us to make more breakthroughs and achieve more gains, and we also hope that we can continue stepping up our efforts to live up to your expectations.
Unidentified Analyst: 
Unidentified Company Representative: So thank you very much, David, for your questions. I hope I answer your question.
Operator: Thank you. There are no questions on the line at a moment.  Next question is from Sam. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, good evening over there in China. Thank you for your presentation. My question is regarding the offer that was made by the founder, maybe 1.5 years ago, 2 years ago. At that point, the coronavirus and the education space in China being uncertain, it seemed like a good deal. It seemed like something the company was interested in. Now that with the hard work of the Tarena team, there's actually a profit being turned. Is that something you can disclose anything regarding if there is still interest in selling the company, taking a price there? Or now that there is actually profit and things are moving in the right direction. Does the team prefer to just continue to build? So I guess just to summarize my question is now that there is a profit, what are the plans for the future with regards to that. Thank you.
Nancy Ying Sun:  All right. This is Nancy. And first of all, thank you for that question. Actually, we think this is a 2-part question. And let me first share with you our long-term continued strategy for our businesses. And then I will hand over to Kelvin, our CFO, to take the questions on the financial side.  First of all, regarding our two businesses, they are turning profits. They are very profitable. And they are moving very - in a very healthy manner. And we have already figured out the rationale and the logic of how to maintain this momentum, and we know how to improve the income for our adult professional education as well as our childhood & adolescent quality education business going forward. So we have every confidence to continue the business in the future.  So - and as we all know that the Chinese government have really stepped up their efforts to promote vocational education development in China. So we believe there will be more opportunities for our ad of professional education, and we are very confident because there are policy support in the future. Regarding our childhood and adolescent quality education business, actually, some of this business's products has been included in the curriculum for some middle school and primary schools in China. So I believe that this will gain more positive feedback for us in the future...  And for the time being, indeed, COVID really has some impact on our businesses in some regions and areas in China, but those impacts are quite marginal.  Meanwhile, we have our business gathered around although the China, so a small portion of impact will not impact the whole picture of our businesses. And meanwhile, we have this online merger off-line model to develop and deliver comprehensive products, so we additional issue for us.  So I hope you are happy with my answer regarding the business strategy side. And now over to Kelvin, our CFO, to share with you the financial side.
Kelvin Lau: Hi, Sam. This is Kelvin. Thanks for the question regarding the prioritization. What I can say right now is we do not receive an offer regarding prioritization at this moment. So of course, I think later, if we receive any protection offers, we will make immediate announcement, I mean, according to all those rules and recognition issued by SEC or tested. So can contact, there's no offer at this moment.
Operator:   There are no questions on the line.  There are no questions on the line at a moment, I'll pass it back to the management... Thank you, operator. If there are no further questions at present, we would like to conclude by thanking everyone for joining our conference call. We welcome you to reach out to us directly by e-mailing at ir@tedu.cn.. If you have any questions or requests for additional information. We encourage you to visit our Investor Relations site at ir.tedu.cn. Thank you.
