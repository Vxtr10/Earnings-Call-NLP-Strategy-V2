Matt?
Matt Roberts: 02:25 Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Vacasa's first earnings call as a publicly traded company. In early December, we started trading on the NASDAQ and added over $340 million of gross cash proceeds to our balance sheet, leaving us well capitalized with a tremendous growth opportunity in front of us. 02:47 I recognize that many on the call today are new to Vacasa story. So I want to spend some time providing background on our company. Next, I'll touch on the substantial progress we made in 2021, before handing it over to Jamie Cohen, our CFO, to cover our strong financial results and 2022 guidance. 03:07 Our business is performing extremely well. We are delivering solid financial performance, executing on our technology roadmap, and expanding our growth engine, all of which extends our leadership position. While this is our first earnings call as a publicly traded company, we have been sharing projections and reporting on our progress throughout most of 2021, and it's clear our business has incredible momentum. 03:35 We consistently beat and raised versus our initial projections. First, we beat Q2 and raised Q3, then we beat the high end of Q3 and raised Q4, then we beat the high end of Q4 and now, we're raising our 2022 outlook. We also expect the business to reach adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full-year 2023. 03:58 Okay, so a quick overview of our company. Vacasa is reinventing the vacation rental industry by leveraging proprietary purpose-built technology to create a better experience for everyone involved; homeowners, guests, and channel partners. Alternative accommodations is one of the fastest growing categories in travel with tremendous consumer demand. Our primary focus is on the supply side of the vacation rental ecosystem, which is highly constrained and ripe for innovation. 04:32 As the only scaled national vacation rental management platform, we play a critical role in fueling the alternative accommodations growth engine. We operate in a massive market with fantastic secular trends. There are more than 5 million vacation homes in the United States alone and 20 million globally. And from a guest perspective, the preference shift towards alternative accommodations started over a decade ago, driven by both technology enablement and expanding the appeal of the category across multiple use cases. 05:09 The vacation rental management industry is a local marketplace, perfectly set up for disruption. Just think about the status quo of renting out a vacation home. Some people do it themselves, which is a ton of work to properly set up your home, effectively market and price availability and service all the guests' needs, including answering the phone call at 2 o'clock in the morning, because the heater is out at the ; or you can enlist a local vacation rental manager, but their fragmented nature and relatively unsophisticated technology leads to sub-optimal homeowner income. 05:48 This is where Vacasa comes in, with technology to modernize and truly rethink the industry. It sounds ambitious, but it's not new, this is a proven playbook. Innovative, tech-enabled platforms have helped create, disrupt, and accelerate industries. There is pattern recognition between what we're doing and what others have done in other categories. Just think about how real estate, mobility, and on-demand delivery have been redefined over the past decade. My experience at OpenTable taught me how meaningful and transformative these tech-enabled platforms can be to local marketplace businesses. 06:28 Our value proposition for homeowners is simple, yet powerful. Just hand us the keys, tell us which nights you want your home for personal use, and start earning monthly income. That's it. We handle all the hard work, like setting up the home, establishing optimal nightly rates, communicating with guests before, during, and after reservation, and ensuring homes are properly cleaned and maintained. 06:55 Our proprietary technology platform serves as the foundation of our business and has been crucial to our success. All key aspects of our platform were purpose-built, addressing specific needs and pain points of the vacation rental management process, resulting in a truly differentiated and elevated experience to homeowners, guests, and channel partners. In the past year alone, we invested nearly $50 million on technology, which we believe is greater than the spend as a combined total population of competitive local managers. 07:32 A core component of our technology platform is our dynamic pricing engine, which is designed to generate greater income for homeowners. We accomplished this by using a combination of technology products, artificial intelligence, human expertise, and a significant volume of data to uniquely derive rates for each home on our platform. In fact, homeowners who were previously using local professional managers gained an average of 20% increase in their rental income in the first year and then an incremental 10% increase in the second year after switching to Vacasa. 08:10 In addition to our dynamic pricing capabilities, we are able to capture demand wherever it exists by listing all the homes under our management on Vacasa's own website and consumer app and distributing our listings to more than 100 channel partners, including Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo. While our channel partnersâ€™ account for the majority of bookings, our direct channel is our single largest source, accounting for 30% of gross booking value in 2021. 08:44 For guests, Vacasa provides a consistent and reliable experience that has many similarities to traditional accommodations. Guests can use the Vacasa app to check into the property and unlock the front door. We also offer 24/7 support by phone, online, or through the Vacasa guest app. The top-tier hospitality we deliver ensures guests have a memorable experience, which leads to better reviews, which results in higher income for homeowners. 09:16 Now, turning to the tremendous progress we made in 2021, including adding homes to our platform, introducing new products, and maximizing homeowner income. Over the course of the year, we grew the number of homes on our platform by over 60% through our growth engine playbook, as well as through the strategic acquisition of TurnKey Vacation Rentals. We add homes to our platform with 2 complementary playbooks, an individual and portfolio approach. 09:45 The individual approach is a direct sales model, where we create leads, then predominantly local sales representatives sign up individual homeowners. This approach is used in existing markets and it accounts for the majority of our new additions. Under the portfolio approach, we buy local vacation rental managers, bringing on dozens of homes at once. Through this approach, we are able to efficiently enter new markets and build density at a faster rate, allowing us to accelerate our margin expansion in those markets. 10:21 We made great progress throughout the year, ramping sales capacity under our individual approach, as we successfully added hundreds of new sales representatives. In the fourth quarter 2021, our sales force added nearly 150% more homes than it did in the first quarter of the year. We also expect continued overall sales force productivity improvements going forward, as our recently hired sales executives follow a predictable, tenure-based productivity ramp. 10:54 Our technology teams were hard at work releasing new products to improve the vacation experience for guests and homeowners, and developing tools for our local market staff to drive efficiencies. We are particularly proud of the new Homeowner app, which provides our owners with insight into the management, care, and performance of their vacation rental home, and we are seeing more than 60% of homeowners with the app log in weekly. 11:22 We launched the rollout of our smart home technology package, consisting of keyless locks, WiFi routers, and noise monitoring technology, which is expected to be in place across our entire portfolio of homes by the end of 2022 at no additional cost to homeowners. We created a new clean inspection tool, designed to improve guest and homeowner satisfaction, by ensuring a standardized, efficient cleaning process across the tens of thousands of homes on our platform. And our yield management system also took a big step forward as our data scientists introduced itinerary-based pricing, which uniquely prices each itinerary based on the start and end date and home's availability. 12:12 Now, I'll turn the call over to Jamie to review our fourth quarter financial results and guidance in detail. Jamie?
Jamie Cohen: 12:21 Thanks, Matt. We closed out 2021 on a strong note, delivering revenue and adjusted EBITDA well above our fourth quarter guidance ranges. Before getting into the details on the quarter, I want to provide some perspective on our outstanding financial performance in 2021. 12:38 In July, we outlined ambitious financial targets for 2021. We finished the year with revenue of $889 million, $130 million or over 15% ahead of our initial target and up 81% year-over-year. Given our strong third quarter revenue outperformance and fourth quarter pacing, we made the decision in November to make incremental investments in the business across all of our operating expense lines, with the largest being in sales and marketing to position us well for future growth. Even with these sizable investments, adjusted EBITDA was negative $29 million for full-year 2021, $20 million ahead of our initial target. 13:22 Over the past 2 years our business has not only recovered from the pandemic, but we've significantly scaled, with our gross booking value reaching $1.9 billion in full-year 2021, up 105% year-over-year and tripling from 2019 levels. We also have a truly asset-light business model in which our full-service offering gains us exclusive control of the home calendar. We don't need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy supply or enter into long-term lease agreements and advance deposits on future reservations creates a favorable working capital dynamics. 13:59 Our underlying business has shown to be inherently profitable, as we continue to make discrete, controlled investments in 2 areas, sales and marketing and technology and development. We spent over $225 million, excluding equity-based compensation on these 2 line items in 2021. The size of this investment compared to our reported adjusted EBITDA loss of negative $29 million clearly shows that profitability is . 14:28 Our investments in sales and marketing are largely focused on expanding the teams responsible for adding new homes to our platform. We have a massive market opportunity ahead of us and believe it is prudent to invest aggressively against that opportunity. We apply a lifetime value to the customer acquisition cost framework to evaluate the success of the individual approach, where we typically achieve a very healthy LTV to CAC between 4 times to 5 times and we were at the high end of that range for 2021. 14:57 Within technology and development, we are aggressively hiring product managers and engineers and adding external software to further enhance our technology platform. As Matt touched on in his remarks, our purpose-built technology platform drives our business operations, creates a differentiated experience for our homeowners and guests, allows us to scale more efficiently and supports our strong growth. 15:22 These investments enable us to reach scale faster, which not only drives revenue growth, but improves profitability, as our margins improve meaningfully with . Our profit margins are greater in high-density markets relative to low-density markets, driven by fixed cost leverage, shorter drive time, and labor savings. Additionally, our operating leverage is also evident during our seasonally stronger quarters. 15:48 Now, I'd like to review the fourth quarter. Unless noted otherwise, I will be comparing our fourth quarter results to the fourth quarter of 2020, and I'll be referencing the operating expense line excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and business combination costs, which you can find in both our press release and shareholder letter. 16:07 Nights sold reached $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, up 55% year-over-year, with the increase primarily driven by the addition of new properties to the platform. Gross booking value per night sold, which includes the total rent, fees, and taxes a guest pays was $347 in the fourth quarter, up 27% year-over-year. Year-over-year growth in gross booking value per night sold accelerated each quarter throughout the year. 16:35 While the overall vacation industry did experience strength, our sophisticated machine learning algorithms ensure we appropriately capitalize on the strength, optimizing the mix of nights sold and gross booking value per night sold in an attempt to maximize homeowner income. 16:51 Gross booking value, which is the combination of nights sold and gross booking value per night sold reached $379 million in the fourth quarter, up 96% year-over-year. Revenue, which consists primarily of our commission on the rents we generate for homeowners and the fees we collect from guestâ€™s was $192 million in the fourth quarter, up 76% year-over-year and ahead of our guidance range of $175 million to $180 million. 17:20 Cost of revenue was 56% of revenue in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year operating leverage is due to the strong growth in gross booking value per night sold. Operations and support expenses grew about in line revenue year-over-year. Technology and development expenses were up over 100% year-over-year, as we successfully grew the size of our engineering and product teams and added tools to strengthen our technology platform, and in turn, our value proposition to homeowners and guests. 17:49 Sales and marketing expenses were $66 million, up $49 million year-over-year, with the increase primarily due to our brand advertising campaign, scaled homeowner direct marketing, and higher sales force headcount. General and administrative expenses were $19 million in the fourth quarter, with the year-over-year increase due to hiring to support our growing business. 18:10 Adjusted EBITDA was negative $68 million for the fourth quarter, ahead of our guidance range of negative $85 million to negative $80 million, on stronger revenue and expenses coming in at the lower end of our internal expectations. 18:25 Turning to 2022 guidance, we expect revenue to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million for the first quarter and $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion for the full-year. Our guidance assumes that the combination of gross booking value per night sold and occupancy takes a slight step back from the record levels achieved in 2021, but remains above pre-pandemic levels. Specifically, we expect this to be most pronounced in the second half of 2022, as we lap a period of strong consumer demand, which resulted in gross booking value per night sold growth of 19% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2021 and 27% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. 19:09 We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative $25 million to negative $20 million for the first quarter and negative $21 million to negative $14 million for the full year. On the expense side, we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing and technology and development. I would note that we don't plan on running another large-scale brand advertising campaign in the first quarter of 2022, and as a result, expect sales and marketing expenses to decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2021. 19:40 Finally, given the strong execution by our teams and the success of our growth investments, we expect to reach adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full-year 2023. 19:52 One final comment on guidance. We expect to recognize about $13 million of revenue in the first quarter associated with the breakage of future stay we issued to guests at the start of the pandemic. The revenue benefit will also flow through to adjusted EBITDA. While we will recognize revenue associated with the breakage of future stay credit in future period, we expect the amount to be significantly lower in future periods. So we wanted to call out given the size in the first quarter. These impacts are included in our revenue and adjusted EBITDA. 20:24 With that, Matt and I will take your questions. Operator, please open up the line.
Operator: 20:31 Thank you.  First question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. Please proceed.
Doug Anmuth: 21:03  taking the question. I had a couple. I hope you could talk about the sales force. I know, you said you added 200 heads last year, if you could give some color on where you think this could go over time? And then when you think about the â€˜22 growth, how much of that is driven by new supply additions? And I also just wanted to ask about your thoughts on the -- early thoughts on the summer travel season? And do you expect to  to continue to take share in the face of greater reopening and potential return to more urban destinations? Thanks.
Matt Roberts: 21:42 Sure. Hi, it's Matt. I'll take the sales team. So we did add a lot of sales people during this year, we were down in 2020 though, as you remember. So part of it was sort of rebuilding and growing our sales team while have a lot of really positive momentum adding great new people. I would say we're probably going to get about â€“ add about half the amount that we added in â€˜21 in â€˜22 and then we'll also have further improvements in the productivity, the tenured sales reps are about twice as productive as un-tenured. So we're going to get a nice lift as our new sales reps gain tenure. And then, Jamie you want to talk to a sort of growth.
Jamie Cohen: 22:35 Yeah, absolutely. So, as Matt said, there will be -- there will be a lot of great growth in terms of new sales coming from the reps that we added last year. If you call, the rest -- at least 12 months of tenure are about twice as productive as those with less than 12 months. So we'll continue to see productivity gains over the course of 2022 from the reps that we added in 2021. 23:02 And then, general rule as we tend to see about 85% of our revenue coming from units that are already on the platform prior to the year beginning. So itâ€™s a pretty decent rule of thumb in terms of current supply versus new supply "
