Adjusted EBITDA up 34.7% and adjusted net income up 39.9% for the quarter. Our high growth is driven by increased traction in our core business and an increase in revenue contribution for our new business segments. Let's look at the detail the breakdown of respective segments on slide 12. Our focuses on ramping of our schools are providing return from our acquired business and the delivering premium education service to our students is continuing to drive our strong performance. The top-line growth after our respective business segment continues to expand for the quarter. As International Schools, Bilingual Schools and Kindergartens grew over 25.2%, 24.7%, 29.7% respectively. Our Complementary business grew by 244.7% as a result of the strong performance and the contribution from Can-Achieve. Slide 13 shows more details of our school expansion and enrollment increase as a market demand for quality education continued to be very strong.

Moving on to Slide 15. Our performance is a reflection of our commitment to quality education and to delivering the best the academic results for our students. As of the release date which is still early in admission season, approximately 60% of the students in the 2019 graduating class of our international school have received 356 offers from global top 50 institutions including one from the University of Chicago and four from Oxbridge. We expect that many more students will receive offers for these elite institutions as the admission cycle continues. Our business operational front, please refer to slide 16, we continue to progress important strategic initiatives to expedite pace of growth and I would like to provide a few updates before hand over to call to Dora for detail of our financial results. To pursue organic growth is one of the key initiatives to build our business scale. As of January 17, 2019 with the opening of three kindergartens in Guangdong, Shandong and Hunan, we have total of 68 schools including 6 international schools, 15 bilingual schools and 47 kindergartens, covering nine provinces in China. It provides a total capacity of over 58,619 seats. The guidance to open five new kindergartens is still well on track. On strategic investments which underpin our plan to accelerate business growth. I'm pleased to report that as of the release date, we have completed three strategic acquisitions and each of them represents a major milestone as we expand our global footprint and the further broaden our complementary service offerings. First, our very first overseas school, Bournmouth Collegiate School in the UK. Second is the renowned Zhejiang based art training institution, Hangzhou Impression and finally to oversee career counseling company Chengdu Yinzhe which owes famous brand DreambigCareer. We continue to foster new collaborations and in entered into strategic cooperation with Changchun Normal University, a second a collaboration following in Beijing Normal University. Bright Scholar plans to provide approximately 200 internship positions and recruit about 300 teachers in the next few years. The deeper collaboration with Country Garden is crucial to fast expanding our networks in asset- light way.

In concluding my remarks, Bright Scholar has delivered another strong quarter with robust growth from our core business and the increasing contribution from acquired assets in complementary business. Our positions remain a strategic imperative as we accelerate investments to establish our global footprint and expand our domestic business. With organic growth momentum driven by strong traction across respective segments, we continue to make tremendous progress towards our business and the financial goals that delivers sustainable long -term value to our shareholders.

That's all we have in the form of prepared remarks. And we're now turning over to Q&A. Operator, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Christine Cho of Goldman. Please go ahead.
ChristineCho: Hi. Thanks Jerry and Dora and welcome Feng. So I have two quick questions. So one is related to within the cost of revenue. We can -- we see that you've broken out a new item called commission fee. Can you just elaborate on what that item is and what I think the outlooks for that item going forward? And then second question relates to the complementary education services because it's actually growing in terms of importance. And I think Jerry mentioned it's a part of your long-term growth strategy. Can you just elaborate on the direction and also in terms of a margin outlook and in that complementary education services?
DoraLi: Hi, Christine. This is Dora and let me answer your questions. First regarding the commission fees in our cost structure. Remember, we consolidate Can-Achieve into our complementary education services. The commission fees is part of Can-Achieve cost element. That's the commission they provided to their secondary agents. Second question regarding the margin profile or expectation for the whole complementary education services. As we mentioned Can-Achieve I think we mentioned last quarter already due to the nature of the business Can-Achieve's gross margin is compared to our core business K12 business is relatively in a lower range. So that's why it's also you can see on the gross margin, blended gross margin this report you can see we have a relatively slow increase in terms of gross margin for the whole group. And also as Jerry just mentioned that we just complete three acquisitions which including the Hangzhou art training institution, Hangzhou Impression and also the career counseling services which they will be consolidated starting from our second quarter and their margin profile is at the bottom line is pretty much a little bit lower and in line in the 20s, yes.
Operator: The next question comes from Sheng Zhong of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
ShengZhong: Hi, congratulations to Jerry and Derek, and also congratulations to the good results. I have two questions. One is about the student enrollment; actually you deliver very good growth of the student enrollment this quarter especially on the International School. So what did you do to have the strong in international school and do you think your full year's enrollment guidance is too conservative at today's point of view? And secondly is also about the international school. At the same time we --you increase the utilization rate but it's the gross margins, it's relatively flat with last year. So any reason for this and what do you see the margins trends? Thank you.
JerryHe: Okay, thank you for asking the questions. I would take the first one and let Dora to take the second one. The first one is about the enrollment. So actually two things that we have done. I guess in the last couple of years and first one because our students are getting better academic results. They have been to better schools so our brand named has been better than in the past. So we have more students coming through our international school to apply. And second, of course, we have been ramping up our branding and the marketing efforts. We have put a more investment of people on the ground to run more marketing campaigns to bring more students into our schools. So it's two add together so we have more enrollments than what ever have done in the past. We would expect those trend will continue as we --our school are getting better results and so we our brand is getting more better known in the market as well.
DoraLi: Hi, Sheng Zhong. This is Dora. I'll take your second question regarding blending margin, margins for our international school. You may notice that the blended ASP for international school is flat for this quarter. I think the major reason we have explained before because except the Guangdong international school, the other five schools are still ramp up. So we normally or will not-- we didn't raise their --our tuition fees for these five schools and also for Guangdong school due to the local authority reason our application for raising the school fees was kind of hold for this school year. So basically for Guangdong school we didn't either raise the school fee this school year. And actually for the rest of the international school, their individual gross margin has been improved because of Guangdong kindergarten, the fee didn't increase and also the one school in Guangdong we recruit more school, most students from the primary school which the fees for the primary school stage are relatively lower. So that impact the margins for the Guangdong school and on the blended basis you can see the gross margin improve are relatively slow. But with improve in the utilization from the other five new schools we will see a better improvement in the future.
Operator: The next question comes from Jian Song of Industrial Securities. Please go ahead.
JianSong: Good evening management, congratulations for good season. I have two questions. The first is about the three new kindergartens in financial season. Could you tell me if this new kindergartens have been affected by the policy such as the condition for running the schools or the Huiyan policy? Then the second one is the complementary service. I realized that Elan's schools margins decline was part of the reason for a rental expenditures increasing. Can you explain the reason for that increase? Thank you.
JerryHe: Okay. I will take both questions. First one about the kindergarten. The opinion from State Council was put out on November 15, 2018. So that was a fact thing about the source of the funding and also merging the acquisition, but does not affect to organic growth, opening new kindergarten. So those three kindergartens are not affected by that at all. And also it depends on -- in general it depends on where the kindergartens are. If the property is owned by the government and/ or jointly owned by the residence of a community typically the government would have put a price cap on those and put it in the low cost kindergartens zone. But if you actually own the land and own the building that's called a private owned kindergarten should not be affected by that. So most of our kindergartens are in that category. So those three kindergartens are not affected. That's about kindergarten. Also by the learning centers because I see you're probably aware of there are quite a few a round of new policies and regulations against around or about depend on which way you look at about the learning centers nationwide. So they require to lower than, I guess it's can only being in first three floors of any building. So also there are fire codes that they have put into place. So some of our learning centers where we had to relocate to a new location that meet those requirements. Therefore whenever you move you have not adjusted renting but also moving expenses and potentially loss of students as well. That's why our margin for Elan learning centers has gone down quite a bit because all the rules about learning centers.
Operator: The next question comes from Tianli Wen of Blue Lotus. Please go ahead.
TianliWen: Hi, congratulations on the solid quarter. I have few questions here. Could management help us to break down the cost of revenue this quarter? So could the management give out more color on what contains in the cost of revenue and how about the growth rate of each other? And the second question is what the average salary level of your teachers is and what's the average or annual increase in their salary? Thank you.
DoraLi: Let me just repeat your question is the breakdown of revenue by segments?
TianliWen: No, breakdown of cost of revenues.
DoraLi: Cost of revenue.
TianliWen: Yes.
DoraLi: Yes. I think we do have that in our earnings release. Let me just repeat that for you. International school first quarter --
TianliWen: I'm sorry. I can --I just want to know like the cost of the salary, the salary fee of the teachers.
JerryHe: The average salary of teachers', are you asking?
TianliWen: Yes.
DoraLi: While the total -- the total cost of --teaching staff cost I think we reported a total teaching staff costs for the first quarter is around RMB223 million for the first fiscal quarter and we also reported the teaching and instructor number for the first quarter. So for on average basis we can do an easy calculation is somewhere around like RMB48, 000 for the first quarter then you divide it by three is probably around like RMB16, 000 per month that's on average basis. The average salary increase is somewhere around --beats the inflation, somewhere around like 6%-7%.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Huang of First Beijing Company. Please go ahead.
AlexHuang: Hi, Jerry and Dora. Thank you for your presentation and congratulations on your promotion. I have two questions. The first one is about our pipeline. Could you tell us how many schools are in our pipeline and in which categories are they? And my second question is about the policy. Could you share us more light and your thought of the policy? Do you think it would have any difference compared to the Shenghua? Thank you.
JerryHe: Okay. The first one is about pipeline, of course, I cannot disclose the exact numbers but I can tell you what are we are looking at. We are looking at the K12 schools double domestic and overseas and I'm probably more emphasized on overseas at this point of time. And also we are looking at the complementary services more on the --other than kind of test drive or related to academic work at a school. So that's what we're looking at. It's very strong pipeline but again I can't talk about numbers. And in terms of policy, Shenghua, the second version actually did not come out as they expected. They were --earlier they were saying the final version would it be -- will come out about end of 2018 but actually by the end of 2018, I mean they came out with another draft for public opinion. And that of course of what we are --we are one for the institution that provided our comments and opinion and send it back to the Department of Justice. So we don't know when it was going to come out but compared to this version to the version we had, I would say qualitatively it's-- I think it's slightly better but not by much. So we wouldn't know for sure what the final version would be, but at least it tells me that they were --they are very cautious about this again because they come back again and again. Because theoretically after the first draft is to consider up to the upper management for a sign-off already. So they came back twice that means at least indicated that they were very cautious about the impact of the law. But like I said, what the final version going to be, we wouldn't know yet.
AlexHuang: Okay, thanks. And I see there are 15 kindergartens in your pipeline. So I want to know that do you think our organic -- our Greenfield of kindergarten is totally not as affected by the new policy on kindergarten?
JerryHe: So according to the current version of the opinion and the laws, they are not affected because it's just not a related to any merging acquisition; it's not related to property owned by the government. So it's a privately owned land and building. According to many of the local government that we consulted with, we can-- it's a free market everything we can register as a for-profit then they're not even going to regulate on the price either. So that's what they told us for now at least. So we think we will continue to develop a new size that in that case we are not try to getting into too much of the space where either the government owned or the committee owned kindergartens. End of Q&A
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jerry He for any closing remarks.
Jerry He: All right. Thank you very much for joining this conference call. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions. We wish everyone a good day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
