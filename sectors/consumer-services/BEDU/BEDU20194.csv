Now I will turn to Derek for his closing remarks.
Derek Feng: Thank you, Dora. This past fiscal year has been a transformation one for us. The expansion of our global network of schools and the beginning of realizing some of the key benefits from the acquisitions made over the last few years have formed a strong foundation for our future success. As we begin the new fiscal year, we see tremendous focus and energy throughout the company as we execute our year at a long-term strategy. This passion will be a tailwind as we drive to accelerate global business expansion and delivering strong results in the quarters to come. This concludes our prepared remarks, and will like to open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today will come from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs.
Christine Chondrodysplasia: Hi. Thank you, Jerry, Derek and Dora for the detailed explanation. I have three quick questions. So one is related to the acquisition acquired overseas schools. It seems like State Michaels and Bosworth was also consolidated this quarter. Can you just give us a rough impact on sales in Op this quarter for these two schools as well? Secondly, I think the guidance on the top line is very, very clear. But I was wondering what would be -- would you be able to give us a rough guidance as to the impact of -- on bottom line of these acquired overseas schools in 2020? And lastly, I think in reading Page 27 of the presentation, is it fair to understand that the M&A related cost that you kind of break broke out. That's more of a one-off related to the M&A this quarter. And then more -- that wouldn't be recurring going forward. But the MMA [ph] portion of that 1.2%, that's there that will actually be continuing to come through over the next few quarters. Is that a right understanding?
Dora Li: Christine, this is Dora. First question, in the past fiscal quarter, we only completed the transaction of cat [ph]. The other two independent score, as Jerry mentioned during his remarks, we completed those two independent school in early September. So their contribution will be started in the first fiscal quarter of 2020. I think that's should answer your first question. And second question, the guidance, the impact of the overseas schools.
Unidentified Company Representative: The guidance for the bottom. We haven't kept of the guidance for the bottom line yet. We think the guidance for the revenue, but not the bottom line. The third one ticket of curtails well the serelisa [ph] ready about the M&A related costs because we have not been a nitant of work on the MAA. We closed a few. So those are what happened in Q4. Going forward, that sort of is a deal-by-deal basis. So you may or may not happen, but we do not expect to be a continue like that for every quarter. Because we have a little bit of more down in the last quarter than, I guess, in the past.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Tommy Wong [ph] with China Merchant Securities.
Unidentified Analyst: Quick question on the enrollment growth you guided. Can you kind of some share with us which international school, bilingual school, kindergarten, which part of the enrollment growth will be faster or slower? I think for '19, actually, both segments grows very fast. Is that going to continue in 2020 very even double-digit growth? And also can you also shed some light on that? Because the slide shows actually kindergarten ASP has increase than what you are paying in international school and bilingual school?
Derek Feng: Yes. Tommy, this is Derek. I'll take it. First of all, we give you the overall enrollment growth to get all together as a group. And in terms of the growth in each one of the socket subsegments, we would expect to be fairly consistent with the past. Second, with regards to the ASP that we have noted in the kindergarten session because of the acquisition was being consolidated in the last year, it was a lower-priced group of kindergarten. So therefore, the blended rate of the impact on the ASP growth has been a negative 1%, but excluding that, lower-priced segment that was acquired, our overall, as kindergarten ASP, has been consistent with the past ASP growth.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. At this time, there are no further questions in the question queue, and this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Derek Feng for any closing remarks.
Derek Feng: Thank you very much for joining the conference call. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions. We wish everyone a good day. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect."
