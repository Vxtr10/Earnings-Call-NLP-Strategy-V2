Derek?
Derek Feng: Thank you, Jerry. Good morning and good evening. We are off to a very strong start in the first fiscal. Please turn to slide 17 for our performance highlights and in slide 18 for detailed breakdown by segments.I am very pleased to report that our overall revenue grew by 69% and operating profit grew by 46.7% year-over-year. More importantly, the operating margins of our China based operations, including domestic K-12 schools and complimentary education services continue to expand.Jump to slide 27, you can find that the adjusted SG&A of headquarter have declined year-over-year despite of increasing skill and complexity of our businesses. These are the early results from the operational improvement initiatives that we started last year.Meanwhile, as we expand our business to reduce risk exposure to domestic K-12 related regulations, as well as to enhance competitive advantages our overall margin profile is also changing in the near-term driven by the different cost structure of the acquired overseas businesses.However, we have a number of initiatives underway, including setting up shared services centers in the U.K. to achieve both revenue and cost synergies among all of our business acronyms that will enhance the overall margin over time.Continue to slide 19, underpinning performance of our domestic K-12 schools was the strong enrollment growth of 25.2%, with the expansion of our school network, including the newly acquired overseas schools, our global school network increased by 29.4% to 88 schools with capacity increased by 14.6% to a total of 67,194 students. Our blended utilization of the quarter was 77%.Let’s continue on to slide 20. Our efforts to improve the effectiveness of marketing and student recruitment have yielded very positive results in driving growth in average student enrollment of domestic K-12 schools with international schools, bilingual schools and the kindergarten industries by 18.6%, 12.3% and 23.1%, respectively. Our robust performance reflects our commitment to delivering quality education as shown in slide 21.As of December 19, 2019, approximately 57.1% of students in the 2020 graduating class of our international schools have received over 310 offers from global top 50 institutions. As of the real estate, our flagship school Guangdong Country Garden School received three conditional offers from the University of Oxford, three conditional offers from the University of Cambridge, and one unconditional offer from the University of Chicago. We expect more students will receive offers from these elite institutions and the grades of our students will continue to improve across all age groups.Continue to slide 22. The deep collaboration with Country Garden is critical to expand our domestic network with an asset light model. As of the release date, we have signed 60 contracts, including five outside Country Garden contracts to operate a total of 53 kindergartens, six bilingual schools and one international school with a total capacity of approximately 29,800 students.In addition, we have made a significant progress to capture incremental growth opportunities among our businesses. First, we commenced international student recruitment for three independent schools in U.K. through CATS.Second, we launched a basketball and baseball pilot programs in two Bright Scholar schools with early success, these programs are after school and weekend activities designed for students from both Bright Scholar and local communities.Finally, our study tour programs have been well received in our own schools. In fiscal -- in the first quarter of 2020, we served over 4,000 students with 80% from Bright Scholar K-12 schools. We are extending our service offerings to better serve more students both from Bright Scholar, as well as schools outside our network.Please turn to slide 23. Driving integration of newly acquired overseas businesses is another strategic imperative. We’re setting up shared service operations in U.K. that not only could serve our business needs better, but also can significantly reduce cost.We are in Phase 1 with focused on finance, IT, human resources and legal functions, of which we’re on track to complete by the end of this fiscal year. Phase 2, would cover operation and procurement, marketing and admission, as well as risk and compliance, of which we target complete before the end of fiscal to 2021.In closing, I would like to reiterate that our number one goal remains to be helping students grow. That means continue to invest in teachers and teacher training to increase complimentary service offerings and to expand global programs that can leverage our global platform and resources. We believe that our focus on academic excellence, in addition to driving an efficient business model will produce consistent growth in revenue and in earnings for our shareholders.So, at this point, I’d like to turn the call over to Dora to discuss our financials.

Derek Feng: Thank you, Dora. Moving forward in fiscal year 2020, we are committed to the ongoing execution of our strategies in the next chapter of our transformation and growth as we work together to achieve our shared purpose to enrich student learning experience. Our team remains focused on pursuing growth opportunities, enhancing operational efficiencies and unlocking values for the benefits of our students, teachers, employees and the shareholders.This concludes our prepared remarks and I’d like to open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Elsie Sheng of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Elsie Sheng: Hello, management. Thank you for taking my question. My question is about the margin outlook. Because you also mentioned that the cost structure changed with the acquisition of overseas schools. And on the one hand, the margin of the overseas school is lower than the domestic. But on the other hand, the margin of your domestic schools and also the complimentary education service is going up year-on-year. So I like to know, what do management see the margin trend of this fiscal year? And also, you mentioned that you have some initiatives to improve the operation of overseas schools. So do you have any, like, more details about how that will change the margin of overseas schools? Thank you.
Derek Feng: Okay. So let me take on the question. So -- because we are just consolidating the overseas business into the portfolio. So, therefore, today is a simple mathematical weighted average of the margins as you can find out the domestic business tend to have high margin will continue to go up and the international business because of the nature of the business model, so the margins are lower, obviously, because the margin is lower we will also paid relatively lower price.So in addition to a mathematical weighted average, which you’re seeing today and we would, obviously, confident that we can take various operating initiatives that would increase the weighted average over time in comparison to a simple mathematic average.So, for example, right now as we mentioned, we are building up shared services centers in U.K., which can -- that would serve a several acquisitions that we have acquired in U.K. over the past year. So that would take out some of the cost. At the same time, we’re also doing recruiting shareholders, that we’re taking the CATS recruiting capability to recruit international students for the other three independent colleges. So in the long run, we’re certainly hoping we will do much better than today’s mathematical weighted average. Does that answer your question?
Elsie Sheng: Okay. Understand. This is a follow up question on the UK schools. You mentioned that the centers that will cost -- save the cost for like operations and do you have more details about how much that can help on the margin?
Derek Feng: Oh! Yeah. So we can’t give you the specific numbers, but what I can tell you, if you add up all the financing people, labor costs of all the seven campuses we have in U.K., including the share of the headquarters finance staff in U.K. using that example, as well as the cost with individual systems. That will put them altogether in relationship with the shared services going forward we would see significant cost reduction.
Elsie Sheng: Okay. I see. Thank you.
Operator: The next question today comes from Christine Cho of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Thank you and I am [inaudible] for the presentation. I think just a follow up to the previous question. Seems like the unallocated corporate expenses dropped quite nicely this quarter. Is it fair to read this as kind of the early results of the operational improvement initiatives that you’ve discussed in detail. And if so, is it fair to assume that it will continue to see a very similar trend throughout the year. And then, secondly, to the extent of how much you can share. Can you just elaborate on the impact of the newly acquired schools that were newly consolidated this quarter? Thank you.
Dora Li: Hi, Christine. This is Dora. Just answer your first question regarding…
Christine Cho: Hi, Dora.
Dora Li: … the so called unallocated corporate expenses. It’s actually the headquarter expenses we refer to that’s mainly the domestic or China operation headquarter expenses. So remember we have discussed our initiative to lower our SG&A expenses since the last quarter, and we are taking the right initiative to reduce the China operation all headquarter expenses, if you have come over to Foshan, so that’s our headquarter. So that’s the expense.And the so called shared services center, Derek, just mentioned, it’s truly will be an overseas cost initiative we just started after we completed the acquisition or the closing of U.K. So we’ll see some, we are expecting to see some result from -- after we complete our first phase and then second phase, setting up of the shared centers. So, does that answer your first question?
Christine Cho: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That’s clear.
Dora Li: Yeah. So second question is also similar related to the first one. So after we gradually finished our shared service center in U.K., we’ll first complete our consolidation or improvement in finance, IT and then legal human resources. All these corporate functions for the overseas operation will be consolidated. And so we are expecting some improvement from the efficiency part after the centers are fully operations.
Christine Cho: Yeah. I see. I was more referring to kind of the sales and op impact us from the consolidation that was really done in the first quarter?
Dora Li: First quarter sales initiative?
Derek Feng: Yeah. Sorry, could you repeat your question again?
Christine Cho: Yeah. Sorry, the new consolidated schools in the first quarter of ‘20. There are two schools that are newly consolidated?
Dora Li: Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Christine Cho: Yeah. Yeah. [Inaudible]
Dora Li: You’re talking about the two independent schools, which is Bosworth and St. Michaels. Yes, those two…
Christine Cho: Yes. Yeah.
Dora Li: … schools are consolidated in the first quarter. Yeah. You’re right.
Christine Cho: Yeah. So I was just wondering what’s roughly the size of the impact on sales and op during this quarter from that consolidation?
Dora Li: Actually the three independent schools are doing well on track in terms of our expectations. I think that the only -- the overall margin from the overseas segment the impact -- the only impact was from CATS, because first quarter CATS has some impact from student intake during some macroeconomic or political reasons for the other three independent schools they are doing okay.
Christine Cho: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Again…
Derek Feng: Yeah. So, basically, sorry, the two schools are generally they are very small, didn’t really add too much to the first quarter. Those two schools add together is approximately 800 students in total. So therefore they’re not that material from overall perspective.
Jerry He: To give you some idea, this is Jerry, just give you some idea of the size of the two schools. Last year the internal revenue they did about approximately £12 million. So if you allocated first quarter, I mean, those two schools are reasonably stable, so you can figure out what’s possible first quarter is.
Christine Cho: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Derek Feng for any closing remarks.
Derek Feng: Thank you very much for joining the conference call. Please feel to contact us if you have any further questions. We wish everyone a good day. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect."
