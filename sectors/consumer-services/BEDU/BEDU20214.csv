We appreciate your continued interest in following Bright Scholar. On today's call and on behalf of the senior management team, the prepared remarks will cover our quarterly and full fiscal year performance. This is the progress and updates. Dora will then provide details on our respective business and financial performance. I will wrap up with a brief conclusion before opening the call for questions. Now let's begin. As you may have seen from our earnings release, we cap off a challenging fiscal year 2021 with a solid fiscal fourth quarter, which is particularly notable in the face of the significant financial impact from the discontinued operations, affected entities in our domestic K-12 business as well as the continued uncertainty and antes in the regulatory and the business operating environment. Please turn to Slide 11 for highlights of our fourth fiscal quarter and the full fiscal year performance. For continuing operations in the quarter, we recorded a 23.3% growth in revenue and 105.6% in gross profit as compared to the same period of fiscal year. On a full fiscal year basis, our revenue was RMB1.4 billion, down by 5.1% as compared to fiscal year 2020. This performance is a direct testimony testament to the strength of our multi-facet growth strategy and the agility of our diversified business. Moving on to the performance of our respective business. On domestic K-12's business, our continuing operation COGS domestic and full profit kindergartens and the K-12 operation services. For our operation services for K-12 schools, we plan to expand into management services and to offer a range of high-quality professional supporter solutions, enabling schools to achieve and operate with excellence and efficiency. Our team of experts assisted school leaders and business measures with specialist advice, reassurance and hands-on operating support. China's COVID-19 complement strategy provides a stable operating environment for continuous recovery, providing high-quality education service is a key component of our vision. Our performance demonstrates our unwavering commitment in delivering quality education as shown in Slide 12. As of August 31, 2021, approximately 93.5% of our 2021 graduate class were admitted to global top 50 institutions and 97.7% were as admitted to global top 100 institutions. For our 2022 graduating class, we made a historical breakthrough and obtained on offer from Princeton University as of the date of this earnings release. We have also been leveraging our collaboration with CATS Global Schools to enrich our offering and, at the same time, to expand into management service offering services such as school operation, property management and maintenance administrative management during the recruitment and the school branding. We believe the expansion into management services will provide significant long-lasting organizational benefit for future partnering schools and creating additional value for advancing actually education in China. Our domestic K and K-12 operations business is well positioned with an evolving regulatory environment in China designed to address quality, equity and around development in China's education system. Continue on to Slide 13 for complementary education services. Bright Scholar is in full alignment with the blueprint of the government policy that focuses all around development for seeds. Our strategic road map is based on our convictions at both schools and noncore contacts are critical to student learning and achievement. Over the years, we have been expanding our complementary learning programs, including study tours and camps and stress our offering by incorporating the overseas study company international contact training and career counseling. We continue to see tremendous market opportunities coming our way, as demand for nonschool supplementary services has been growing at a phenomenal pace. In the fiscal fourth quarter, revenue for complementary education services grew by 16.5% year-over-year to RMB182.6 million. The pace of the growth has been affected by the ongoing travel restrictions from recent outbreaks of the pandemic in China and across the globe. However, in light of the speedy response from the government in offering boosters, we are optimistic that the epidemic will soon be contained again. In the meantime, we continue to execute on our strategy to expand our brand awareness, broaden our service offerings, diversified revenue sources and be ready to increase the market opportunities where operating environment returns to normal. Turning to Slide 14 for our overseas school business, Recovery in the overseas markets continue to be slow but steady despite the travel restrictions that have been on and off amid the fast emergence of new variants. However, our strategic initiatives to streamline the business, review revenue growth and optimize cost synergy yielded early results. In the quarter, revenue recorded an encouraging year-over increase of 9.2%. Overseas business, which recently grouped and branded under CATS Global Schools, CGS, is of strategic importance to us. And is one of the key building blocks to advance our ambition as a global premier education service company. Our long-term vision is to build a business that scales with a market-leading global family of schools, recognized for education excellence. I'm very pleased to report that we have completed the corporate branding campaign with great success and has progressed to the next phase that focuses on integration as well as establishment of high-performing operating models for our group of schools. We expect these initiatives will form the foundation upon which we have to build our business for a post-pandemic future and to be future-ready company. To conclude, we are very pleased about the operational improvement that we have demonstrated in fiscal year 2021 and the progress made on enhancing capabilities that provide a path towards our long-term goals. Heading into fiscal 2022, we are optimistic that our business will have a strong long-term recovery. Our business fundamentals are strong, and we remain well positioned to navigate the current operating environment. The overarching strategy of Bright Scholar, as in Slide 15, is to continue to expand our business portfolios, strengthen operational performance across our global businesses, optimize synergies across the network, broaden our service offerings in complementary education services, expand into management service for domestic K-12 schools and diversify our revenue stream to bring the most value to our students, partners and stakeholders.

This concludes our prepared remarks, and we would like to open the call for questions. Operator, please?
Operator:  And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Anna Zhang from T. Rowe Price. Please go ahead.
Anna Zhang: I have a follow-up on the comments you just gave on the amount due from effected entities. Because I noticed that the short-term investment after restatement is zero. So I'm just wondering because previously my understanding was that, the restricted cash was pledged offshore and you get a loan from onshore with the proceeds put in the short-term investment. So I'm just wondering, is it actually on the affected entities and there's amount due from affected entities to the auxi entity. So it's shown as due from affected entities?
Dora Li: This is Dora. Yes, the amount due from affected entities was part of the -- we continued to do some short-term investments after August 31 because of the continuity of the investment, the investment was invested through the sponsored company, but a sponsor company based on the requirements from the relative law and accounting requirement, the sponsor company was also put into the discontinued operation. So as of August 31, by then, the investments are still under the sponsors company. So on August 31, it shows amount due from the discontinued operation to the listing company. But right now, it has been all settled.
Anna Zhang: Okay. So by settled, you mean it's now cash with the listed company?
Dora Li: Yes.
Operator:  And it appears we have no further questions at this time.
Jerry He: Okay. Should we conclude the call? Okay. Thank you very much for joining the conference call. Please feel free to contact if you have any further questions. We wish everybody a great day. Thank you.
Operator: And with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Thank you."
