Derek Feng: Thank you, Ruby. Thank you everyone, who is joining our call today to review 2020 second fiscal quarter results.Before my remarks, a few words on the pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 is affecting millions of lives around the world and causing unprecedented disruption to education across all ages. Our hearts and thoughts go out to the people who have been affected by this unprecedented event, and we appreciate the health care workers, local communities and governments around the world who are on the front line working to contain this coronavirus.Let's begin. Again, for those who are new to Bright Scholar, we have included in our earnings presentation a brief corporate introduction from Slide 5 to Slide 13, which you can download from our IR website.All numbers are in renminbi, and all comparisons refer to year-over-year unless otherwise stated.I will begin first before passing the call to Dora to provide a detailed financial review and an update on our guidance. We will keep the remarks brief to allow more time for Q&A.Please turn to Slide 13 – Slide 15 for the highlight of our second fiscal quarter and first half performance with detailed segment breakdown on Slide 16 and Slide 17. Following a strong start in our first fiscal quarter, we have delivered even better performance during the second fiscal quarter, which demonstrate the strength of our operation.Compared to the second quarter of last fiscal year, the revenue grew by 72.4%. Gross profit, net income and adjusted EBITDA increased by 104%, 683% and 209.4%, respectively. Driven by the operating initiatives started last fiscal year, the revenue, gross profit, net income and adjusted EBITDA for the first half of this fiscal year increased by 70.5%, 74.6%, 49.7% and 89.3%, respectively. In particular, the domestic K-12 segment delivered remarkable margin improvements.During first half of this fiscal year, the adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 4.2 and 7.2 percentage points, respectively. In addition, our adjusted unallocated corporate expenses, which were mainly from our headquarters, in the second quarter and first half of this fiscal year decreased by 9.4% and 16.2% respectively, despite of the increasing business scale and complexity.Turning to Slide 18 and 19. Our enrollment continues its solid traction driven by organic growth. The average student growth enrollment of first half of fiscal 2020 increased by 23.4% to 51,879 students with blended utilization improved to 77.2% from 71%. The academic accomplishments of our students are the shining stars of Bright Scholar, shown in Slide 20.As of April 2, 2020, 92.1% of students in 2020 graduating class of our international schools have received over 970 offers from the global top 50 institutions, including three offers from Oxford, three offers from Cambridge, four offers from the University of Chicago and nine offers from UC Berkeley. We entered the second half fiscal year of 2020 with focus on implementing a number of exciting strategic initiatives to drive organic growth and achieve synergies with acquired businesses.Please turn to Slide 21 for the highlights. Fettes College Guangzhou, an ultra-elite international school, is on schedule to open this coming fall. Our Online Merge Offline, OMO initiatives was accelerated shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19 virus. The shared services center aimed to provide a central operational support function in U.K. is on schedule to be in operations by this summer.We expect these initiatives will allow us to increase the value from acquired businesses. Our deep collaboration with Country Garden have always been crucial to the expansion of our school network. As of the release date, we have entered into agreements with Country Garden to operate a total of 53 kindergartens and seven schools with a total capacity of approximately 30,000 students.There is little doubt that we are operating an environment with an unprecedented level of uncertainty. While the full impact of this global pandemic remains uncertain, I am confident that our operational strength, healthy balance sheet and world-class teams will lead Bright Scholar to deal with the current challenges and emerge stronger.We have taken measures mentioned in our earnings release and listed in Slide 22 and have vigorous action plans in place to minimize risk of infection in premises as our schools gradually reopen in China, minimize disruption to our global operations and pursue innovative opportunities in challenging environment.We are dealing with this period of uncertainty starting from a position of strength, and I'm confident that we have the right strategy, right service offerings and financial resources to navigate through this environment and emerge from the situation, poised for more success in the future.With this note, I will turn the call over to Dora.

Now I will turn to Derek for his closing remarks.
Derek Feng: Thank you, Dora. We look forward to building on the momentum experienced during the first half of fiscal 2020 once the global environment begins to normalize. We believe that the market opportunities, our business fundamentals and other the same factors that drove – that has been driving our growth trajectory this year-to-date and in recent years will help Bright Scholar to resume accelerated growth for the long-term.This concludes our prepared remarks, and I would like to open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Congratulations, Derek and Dora, for such a great set of results. I just have a quick question regarding your revised guidance. Can you just walk us through some key assumptions in considering these revisions, particularly with aspect to the kindergarten business as well as overseas and complementary education services divisions, please? And then also if there are any kind of update on potential refund obligations, either in China or in the overseas markets that you're in. Thank you.
Dora Li: Hi, Christine. This is Dora. Thank you for your question. Okay, regarding the revised guidance, we have good order conservative considerations we can have our best education. For instance, for our domestic K-12 business, because of all the kindergartens are not back to campus as we're speaking right now, so we conservatively considered there will be 2.5 months kindergarten closing. So we didn't account in the 2.5 months revenue, tuition fee revenue, meals revenue for kindergarten. And also for our domestic K-1 to K-12, although all those classes are majority started online classes – extended classes started at the beginning of March, but students still didn't come back to campus.So we conservatively accounted about a half – 1.5 months of boarding and meal fee into our consideration in the current forecast. And also for our overseas, it's the same situation. Because of the school closed in overseas students either go back to their home country or leap off-campus. So we consider some revenue shortage in the boarding and the meal. And also the impact for our complementary mainly, for instance, for the after-school class, after-school training business, because all the off-line classes cannot be resumed until all the regular schools are reopened, so that's part of the impact for our complementary. And also for our study tour and camp business, for the summer, which is really the peak season for the study tour and camp business.So because of the current situation, so we consider there might be some impact for study – and the study tour and camp business for the summer. And for overseas, there's also some short-term summer language training program. And due to the COVID-19 impact, that part of business probably will have some shortage. That's pretty much our expectation based on the current COVID-19 situation.Also for the refund, as you know, for all domestic schools, we pretty much collected the tuition fees for the screen term. And we will – as I mentioned before, we already – in terms of revenue, we conservatively lowered down our revenue recognition. For the refund, we will follow whatever the local authority, the instruction. Because right now, we haven't heard any formal instruction from the local education authorities.
Christine Cho: Okay. Thank you.
Derek Feng: Yes, Christine. This is Derek. Let me just comment on that. Number one, for the tuitions, our general policy is that we will not refund any of them particularly for domestically because the school actually opened in the beginning of March, even the – over distance. So we don't think that there's much a problem from that. There are moderate risk, obviously, from the kindergarten perspective. Because as you know, generally, the cash – or the revenue is calculated on a monthly basis.But as Dora mentioned, right now, where everybody is waiting for the clear guidelines from the government and because of some of the classes may go into the weekends as well as part of the summer, so that would also claw back some of the missing time. So therefore, from a refund perspective, we're not worrying too much.
Christine Cho: That’s very clear. Thank you, Derek.
Operator: Our next question will come from Elsie Sheng with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. [Operator Instructions]
Elsie Sheng: Hello management. Thank you. I have a question on the margin. How should we look at the margin trend in the second half? Because on the one hand, you have operating improvement and more leverage on the operation. But on the other hand, the revenue will be lower. So how should we look at the margin trend? Thank you.
Derek Feng: Number one, we generally don't give the guidance on the margin, but I could answer in the following way. So internally, we are taking initiatives to reduce the cost structure a lot more aggressive than what we think this reduction of the revenue would be because we want to make sure we are more conservatively prepare our cost structure not only for the short-term but using – also using the opportunity to rightsize our operation going forward.So relative to the portion of the reduced revenue, the cost savings were actually – could be higher than that percentage. So without giving you any guidance on the margins that I think you guys – the models are actually very detailed, actually openly very conservative. So I would say, internally, we are targeting to achieve and overachieve our originally targeted blended margin. So that's how far that I could go. And if you look at our ability to take the cost out, the margin is probably one of the last things that you would worry about.
Elsie Sheng: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'm showing no questions in our queue. So this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Derek Feng for any closing remarks.
Derek Feng: Well, thank you very much for joining the conference call. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions, and I will conclude the remarks with –the session with one wish. I wish everybody stay healthy. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
