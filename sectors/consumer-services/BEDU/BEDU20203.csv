As a total capacity of approximately 35,500 students in China. Second, our school business. As with our educational service providers.

Junli He: Thank you, Dora. Our transformative business model, moderated growth strategy, global school network, diversified portfolio, technology enabled OMO offerings and most importantly our exceptional group of employees will enable us to fulfill our mission with distinction and position into the future. We look forward to keep you updated of our continued progress that we executed on our growth strategy to enhance value for both students and stakeholders. This concludes our prepared remarks and we would like to open the call for questions. Operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Sheng Zhong with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sheng Zhong: Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. First one, can you give us more color about your OMO strategies. What the OMO will be title on the floor or on the supplementary services. And the second question is, because of the pandemic a lot of institutions actually is in very difficult situation, do you see more M&A opportunity in this current state. Thank you.
Junli He: Hi, Zhong, thank you for asking the questions. I would touch on both of them, this is Junli. For the OMO what we are doing right now, we are actually developing a platform that were opened for business for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. So that program were combine our experience for offline schools and also offer a mix of curriculum online for students around the globe. For example, we are going to offer eight hour classes, so student anywhere, if they are in China or UK or another parts of the world can take class online. Of course for those who are in China they also have the advantage to take down the class offline in our physical schools. For students who are attending to our UK school, for example because of the pandemic they cannot go back to the UK. They have the option to take some classes, online, with their teachers in UK, but also they can go sports and other things offline in our physical schools. So start with a level and English tutoring as well, but we intend to have a more broad selection down the road including a [indiscernible] as well. But you also asked about the complimentary education, because of the pandemic we already moved some of those online already. For example, even as children we already moved online - most of the students are taking class online during the closure of the learning centers. But the platform will recognize developing a more sophisticated than the tutors center would require, because learning management is interactive. So they actually can keep track of a students’ learning records across the entire school year or over the number of school years. That is for the OMO. And also, you are absolutely right, this pandemic approved a lot of opportunities for position because many of the other businesses are suffering. Many of them actually end up brink of closing down there. We have been contacted by a number of organizations that are experiencing financial difficulties. Without help, they are probably going to go through some kind of closure or bankruptcy process. We are actively looking into some of those opportunities, that we believe the best opportunity to take action, would be the next six or year not right now. And the validation would come - that force.
Sheng Zhong: Understand. Thank you very much. So just a follow-up about the M&A opportunity, do you see more opportunity in the supplementary service side or you mean the school.
Junli He: Actually both, to give you maybe some color, we try to work for hours of business in the UK in the U.S. for example, many of the private schools because they don't have a strong balance sheet as we do, so I mentioned that we says cash and cash equivalents - net cash is a short-term investment. We have almost RMB4 billion which is somewhere about US$570 million or US$580 million. So we are going to be fine for to go through this pandemic and we don’t have any problem, but many of them don't have expenses like that. Literally without income, they are going to go down. So they are asking for help, those schools K-12 schools can be bought at I would say compared to last year, maybe half of the price in some cases or even less. So what we are on this fair footing, because our overseas business also impacted, we are taking opportunities to make it more efficient and a screen our business but once we go through these, because we are really in pandemic right now, but if once we go through this, we are on very strong footing. I think that's a good time to take off to some opportunities overseas. In China, particularly for K-12 schools there are also some opportunities, the evaluation as I mentioned kindergarten significantly compared to let's say the same time last year. But China has reasonably controlled the pandemic. So I think most likely there maybe some particular areas, or cities, most of the country is going back to normal for this coming school year. So there would be some opportunities, but the schools are doing fine as you know, even though students may not go back to school for boarding the meals, but it is continuing to enroll either online or offline for the school. So the school business is doing fine. So there are some opportunities to K-12 schools there as well. But there are huge opportunities for complimentary part of it, because many of - I have to ask them we don't have this - we have seen a lot of them potentially, I would say maybe I have them really experience province and we of course have seen some opportunities came to us at very attractive valuation in normal situation without pandemic.
Sheng Zhong: Thank you very much. That is very helpful.
Junli He: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is with Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Sure, thank you Junli and Dora. I have two quick questions. One is I know that that situation remains quite fluid with right plan, do you have a sense of kind of what you are expecting for the overseas schools in the next few quarters. And secondly, I know you are preparing for the opening of Fettes College in Guangzhou and I was wondering how the preparations are going for the opening in September, Thank you.
Junli He: Sure. Again this is Junli, for overseas schools, we have seven schools in the UK and one school in the U.S., the seven schools in UK there are two buckets, three of them are independent schools. Most of our students are local student, and local means students are [indiscernible] UK. So they are a less impact, just like any local schools in most they may be stay at home, but still taking classes out in school, of course, just like in the school we have in China, you would not be able to charge them on boarding in the meals, but tuition is there. And I think relative to the U.S. UK has done a better job in terms of controlling the pandemic, we are looking at - I just got update last week [indiscernible] has maybe 300 to 400 new cases a day and also by clusters. So of course, I don't know that for sure, but most likely the schools are going to back to be opened in fall for the school. So the independent schools, again, schools taken most students from UK, I think there are going to be fine. There are four schools that have take a mode of student as to the international students depends on where the students are. It is a hard to say they are going to come back. I think if there are percentage of those students would not go back to the UK for school, but for those schools we have somewhere between 20% to 40% of students come here from China, if not going back to the UK, they can remain register and continue study in one of our campus in China. So we would not lose those students, but somebody coming from, let's say, Brazil or Russia, or we don't have exact information on whether or not they would have come back or not. Of course we have some - already but given the situation in UK is fair and clear, we don't know for sure yet, but we would expect there would be some losses of students for the coming quarter. But relative other - to our competitors, many of them actually are shutting down. We are much better position because one we have our China campus to support our students from China then two, we have virtual schools to support students. And we also have other programs for the students as well. The schools in the U.S. is a little bit troubling, actually in Massachusetts, but [indiscernible] also doing a better job than other states in the U.S. But it really depends on what are the actions that - taking from the U.S. government or local government or whether or not that school is going to open on not, or these students from other countries were back to the U.S. and remain again uncertain at this point of time. We do expect out students would have come back given where they are. For example maybe in Brazil is actually the situation even worse than what it is in Massachusetts. Maybe they would come back. But most of the Chinese students may decide to go to school to our China campus or do that online. But regardless, I would think that most of students will continue to study, maybe more than half at least a half of them were doing it online. But some of the students maybe lost, but I would think as the situation have become more clear we would have a better idea of where we are going. But either way, we are prepared for a resurgence of the COVID-19 and prepared to take care of our students when they come to our campus. We have kept our parents posted as how we take actions to protect our student. We send out more than 50 pages of kind of procedure outline everything for [indiscernible], and students what happens if - what time we have to going to make sure that we take care obviously. We have launched a campaign called a WeCare. That is specifically for that. For Fettes College Guangzhou, we just like to open that in September for sure. We are in the final inning of recruiting the students and then of course it pushes for the opening that is a definitive opening in September.
Christine Cho: Okay. Thank you. That is clear.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the congress back over to Junli He for any closing remarks. Thank you.
Junli He: Thank you. Thank you very much for joining the conference call. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions. We wish everybody a good day and stay healthy.
