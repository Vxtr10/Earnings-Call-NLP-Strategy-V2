Let’s continue on to Slide 16. Our acquisition and partnership provide us with the both the growth impact impetus and the operating platform to expand our footprint in educational service offerings. Over the course of the fiscal 2018, we completed four acquisitions, including Xinqiao and Can-Achieve, Foundation Global Education and Zangxing and expect to close the transaction on Zhejiang-based art training institution by the end of November 2018.

Our partnership with Country Garden allows us to grow our school network with an asset light model. We recently signed a contract to operate 12 Kindergartens and the one Bilingual Schools, with total capacity of approximately 5,000 students.

On a fiscal year basis, adjusted SG&A expenses accounted for 19.7% of total revenue, same as last year.

Jerry He: Thank you, Dora. I’m very pleased that we have consistently and consecutively delivered strong results year-over-year that even exceeded our internal expectations. We ended the year on a high note, with a strong quarter on multiple fronts and very strongly – very strong financially, positioning us extremely well for the future. We end our fiscal 2019 with a focus on our core business by expanding our portfolio of services, increasing the utilization of our schools, empowering our students and teachers, and delivering superior academic outcome. I’m confident that with our collaborative and inspired colleagues across Bright Scholar colleagues across Bright Scholar networks and the family of companies, unique expanding broad-based business, sows strategic investment in education services. We are well-positioned for success today heading into the future. That’s all we have in the formal prepared remarks. And we are now turning over to Q&A. Operator, please.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Sheng Zhong with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sheng Zhong: Hi, Jerry, Dora, thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. One – the first one is about our guidance. So this is purely based on the organic growth. Just wanted to double confirm and what’s the enrollment growth? And what the enrollment growth breakdown to different schools? And secondly, it’s about the Country Garden’s project because we previously have some pipeline from Country Garden’s project, so looking forward to what the pipeline looks like.
Dora Li: I’ll take the question on the guidance. So our current guidance is pretty much based on our existing revenue, which is our K12 business, our – including our Complementary, including Xinqiao, global foundation and also amount the current guidance we included the two acquisition we are expecting to close in November, which is the Zhejiang-based art institution and also DBC. So that’s basically what we have in our current guidance. In terms of enrollment for our K to 12 schools, we are expecting right now roughly between 13% to 14%, as pretty much for each of our segments investments falling in that range. And your second question would be? The project, potential project with Country Garden. So right now, we forecast we are expecting over to open five new Kindergartens. That’s all within Country Garden, and the reported 13 new contracts is on top of that, but due to the construction plan from Country Garden, we do not have a detailed or very accurate operation timeline for the additional 13 we just reported in our release. But it will be in the next two to three years.
Jerry He: And also there will be, this is Jerry. So there will be more contract to be signed in this current fiscal year that we have not reported. We only reported the ones that we already signed.
Dora Li: Correct.
Sheng Zhong: Thank you very much, Jerry, Dora.
Operator: The next question comes from Tianli Wen with Blue Lotus. Please go ahead.
Tianli Wen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have one question here. Could management help me to breakdown for SG&A this quarter? We see a decline on SG&A as a percentage of revenue for this quarter year-over-year. So could management give us more clear on that? Where will this trend go?
Dora Li: You can see as a percentage of revenue, SG&A as a percentage of revenue, on a quarter basis, if we take out the share-based compensation expenses, for the quarter is only around like 28% of the revenue, 27.7% to be exact. At the last fiscal quarter is almost 32.3%. So in other words, as a percent of revenue, SG&A expenses as trending down. It’s the same for the whole year. We just talked about that. If we keep that flat, 19.7% SG&A as a percentage of revenue, same as last year, even we have been invest a lot in talents, but we have been well-managed the total SG&A expenses, because as a growing company, we need to invest a lot upfront, like for instance our marketing, to support our build our branding. And also we have to invest a lot to our IT or system to support a long-term growing company.
Jerry He: This is Jerry. I’ll add to that. The SG&A as a percentage of revenue will continue – we expect to continue to trend down because the growth rate of our revenue. I think if you look at it, there is a page for that. Look at the combined annual growth rate of our revenues about 30%. Of course, our SG&A has been growing in absolute terms, but as a percentage, it’s not sustained. So basically we are capitalizing on the economies of scale. We expect the percentage of revenue continue to go down.
Tianli Wen: Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.
Operator: The next question comes from Nicky Ge with China Renaissance. Please go ahead.
Nicky Ge: Hi, Jerry, Dora, thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions here. Number one is about our guidance. Just want to know what is the implied AFT on tuition rate for the last year? And the second question is about our M&A strategy. We have done quite a few M&A in that last quarter. Just wondering what is M&A strategy going forward in next year?
Dora Li: Nicky, I’ll take your first question regarding the guidance on the AFT. If you look at our 2018 AFT trend, basically for International Schools for 2018 is flat and we have a healthy increase from Bilingual and also from our Kindergarten sector. As you know, our International Schools are still have a lot of vacancies. Although, at the end of 2018, we have a 49% utilization, but we still have a lot of room – a lot of vacancies. So the priority for International Schools is to increase utilization. And so we are not expecting a very high AFT increase from our International School and for our Bilingual School and the Kindergarten, we are expecting relatively moderate AFT increase for 2019. And the next question in terms of M&A, I will turn that question to Jerry.
Jerry He: Thank you for your question. For M&A, we are focused on a few areas. One is, if you look at the K12 space, if you look at K12 as Kindergarten one line and international education. Recent private education promotion law came out, we are very selective in terms of one line. So we’re going to focus on two ends. One is the Kindergarten, which is by current law, we can elect for full profit. So that’s where we’re going to focus in terms of domestic M&A and also be for the International will be most likely that’s not going to be from M&A, it’s most likely it’s going to be from Greenfield. So another area of domestic acquisition will be the Complementary Education Services. For example, Can-Achieve and Foundation Global we acquired are really helping the student to apply to schools overseas and that’s an area and also recently announced the Zhejiang-based art institution really helps students to improve their profile as they’re well-rounded students. That’s domestic, and internationally, we are focused on K12 schools because we believe there is a tremendous benefit for our students and teachers to by having a global network of schools. So we recently acquired Bournemouth Collegiate School is one of those things. We would expect to continue to that, look at other countries and build a global network of schools.
Nicky Ge: That’s very helpful. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you, Dora.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Huang with First Beijing Investment Limited. Please go ahead.
Alex Huang: Hi, Jerry, hey, Dora. Thank you for the presentation and for the greater results, you have delivered. I have three questions. The first one is about our fourth quarter net income because we booked positive net income, which is good but also kind of unusual for our business because we have the summer holidays. So could you help me understand how did we achieve this result? And the second one is about our guidance. Could you explain the big GAAP between the revenue guidance and the enrollment guidance? And the third one is about our margin. Can we expect further margin expansion in 2019?
Dora Li: On the fourth quarter revenue net income, we have – during the fourth quarter, we have a contribution from our camps and study tour business, which we mentioned contributes almost RMB 10 million during the fourth quarter and also we have Can-Achieve – contributed around RMB 26.2 million revenue for the quarter. In addition to that, our core K12 business also have a very healthy increase. Our International School revenue increase around 23%, bilingual 30%, and Kindergarten almost 36%. That’s all helps us to have – to achieve a very good first quarter versus last year. And the second question is regarding?
Jerry He: The gap between the revenue guidance and the enrollment numbers. And I can explain that a little bit. Because the GAAP – the enrollment included not just schools – because the guidance for enrollment is only for schools – K12 schools, but as a percentage of revenue, nonschool business went up.
Dora Li: Complementary.
Jerry He: So that explains partially the gap. Also there’s a few acquisition with did last year in fiscal.
Dora Li: 2018.
Jerry He: 2018, now it’s going to do full year consolidation in 2019 as well.
Alex Huang: Quick follow-up question about this. So how do we expect the organic growth of our new business for the next year?
Jerry He: You mean just schools?
Alex Huang: Yes, K12 schools.
Jerry He: Because it’s how do we define organic? Because if we acquired in the past year, of course it’s going to be fully consolidated this year, so we consider that organic. So this guidance does not include any new acquisitions we are going to make.
Alex Huang: I mean, how much can account for the Complementary service and how much is for the K12 school business about the growth?
Dora Li: Roughly.
Jerry He: Maybe we’ll give you the number roughly, because we never gave out this guidance.
Dora Li: Basically, the 34% to 37% top line growth, I will see in the roughly basis may be around 22%, 23% will coming from our core K12 business and the rest were coming from the Complementary. That is roughly a breakdown.
Alex Huang: Okay, and the last question is about margin expansion.
Dora Li: You may notice that we only forecast expect to open five new Kindergartens during 2019, which means for 2019 our key focus will be ramping up our existing school. If you look at the model for K12 schools, when they pass their breakeven point, the margin will go up very quickly. And the good example is our International Schools segment. You can see that we increased our gross margin for International Schools from 28.8% to almost 37%. We have 36.5% for our International Schools. So we will see – we have a good opportunity to further improve our margin during 2019 as we will keep on – we’ll focus on ramping up our existing schools.
Alex Huang: Okay, quick follow-up on this. In terms of margin, is the business – the Complementary business we have acquired accretion or dilution to our whole margin?
Dora Li: If you look at the whole year for 2018, we do have a margin dilution from the Complementary. Two major reasons, one is our existing élan business margin get a little bit decreased and also for Can-Achieve, their gross margin is compared to K12 is, because of the nature of the business, is between 25% to 30%, in that range. But for Can-Achieve, in terms of their bottom, I mean, there net-net margin is still in a very good profit range.
Alex Huang: Okay, okay. Thank you, Dora. Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: The next question comes from Robbie Lee with Generation Capital. Please go ahead.
Robbie Lee: Hi Management, good evening. Just very quick follow-up on the previous question. So what’s your outlook for the margin for the International School? I think you talked about the market outlook in general. Could you please give me some specific color, on the margin for International School, because I saw a big jump for the International School margin in the fiscal year 2018. So how should we think about 2019 and beyond?
Jerry He: So I will take that question. If you talk about International Schools, so basically because our utilization is relatively low, meaning we have a lot of empty seats. So for school business, you tend to once you pass the breakeven point, your margin improves significantly because the margin cost of additional students is very low. You put more students in a not a full classrooms so you don’t actually have much improvement in the cost. That’s why for existing school, and assuming we are not opening any new International Schools, for existing ones, we will expect the margin will continues to improve significantly as we ramp up the enrollment.
Robbie Lee: Okay, okay. And also a question so previously you said, in terms of the revenue guidance that also includes the two acquisitions that will be completed in November. So they are also tied to the enrollment guidance because the guidance on enrollment?
Dora Li: This two are in Complementary business, so the enrollment is only for the K12 schools.
Jerry He: So it’s not included.
Dora Li: Not included.
Jerry He: Again, this does not include anything let’s say, we make an acquisition in the second quarter, it does not include in any potential future acquisitions.
Robbie Lee: Okay, got it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jerry He for any closing remarks.
Jerry He: All right, thank you very much for joining the conference call. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions. Wish everyone a very good day.
