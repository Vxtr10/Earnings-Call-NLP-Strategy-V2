We opened the 3 new kindergartens during the 2019 fiscal year.That concludes my financial update. Now I will turn the call back to Derek for his closing remarks.
Derek Feng: Thank you, Dora. The consecutive quarterly and yearly growth results continue to demonstrate our commitment to generate a sustainable revenue growth. Our businesses -- our students plays great value in our pursuit of excellence in our performance as we continue to accelerate the pace of scaling our business both organically and through strategic acquisitions.This concludes our prepared remarks, and I would like to open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Elsie Sheng with Morgan Stanley.
Elsie Sheng: My first question is about the new proposed acquisition of the schools in U.K. Do you have any details about the schools to be acquired. For example, like the capacity and tuition fee level and your future plans for the schools? And my second question is about the SG&A expense, because SG&A as percentage of revenue has going up -- has been going up, and do you have any guidance for any more details on that you can share?
Jerry He: Yes. I will take the first question about the acquisition in the U.K. We laid out in our scripts, we made the three acquisitions: Bournemouth and also St. Michael's and Bosworth work together and then we've acquired CATS. And combined capacities about -- for CATS about 3,400; for St. Michael's and Bosworth, it's about 700; for BCS, it's about 700. In total, it's about 4,800. In terms of average tuition, if you do the math for the total round, we stated it's about 108 million. So divided by the number of students, you can get approximately what the tuition would be. So for the SG&A, I'll let Dora to take the SG&A question.
Dora Li: For the quarter and for the 9-month basis, we have just mentioned we are investing on people and on marketing to support our long-term sustainable growth. And you have noticed, we have acquired quite a few business, expanded our top line. And if we separate the acquired business and also some acquisition-related expenses for the quarter, our SG&A as a percentage of respected revenue is relatively stable around 16%. On a 9-month basis, the SG&A as a percentage of revenue actually stay at the same around 19.2%.
Elsie Sheng: Okay. Just follow-up on the SG&A. Do you expect the percentage of SG&A to stay at the 3Q level because there are more acquisitions going forward? Or what's your view on the future trend?
Dora Li: Would you want to repeat your question?
Elsie Sheng: I'm asking do you have any view on the future trend of SG&A expense given that there are more acquisitions coming?
Jerry He: Yes. This is Jerry. I'll take that question. Typically, together we have the school business then we have the nonschool business. Typically, for the nonschool business, we have higher gross margin or so, at the same time higher SG&A, okay? That's kind of the mix of the business. The school business have higher -- lower gross margin, but have very low SG&A as well. So it depends on the mix of the business, especially when you're looking at acquisitions. But in general trend, if you have -- see -- you could see from the last past three years as we scale our business, there is economy of scale and it would go down. But for this quarter particularly because we have a lot of kind of MA-related and the structure-related costs. So for this quarter, it's higher than -- I would say, it's higher than last year and also higher than the first couple of quarters, but I would do expect as the business continue to grow, the -- as a percentage it's slightly trending down.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs.
Christine Chondrodysplasia: For the overseas school, the business actually is growing quite substantially with the recent announcement. What are some of the key opportunities in this you see from here? And can you elaborate on the growth and margin potential going forward, given it's becoming a bigger part of the business on a forward basis?
Jerry He: Sure. I will take the question. Typically, when we look at acquisition overseas, we are looking at high-quality schools with self-sustainable financials, meaning they are actually profitable to begin with. The remaining of the schools have a history, have high quality in their respective regional cities, but with global presence we have, we can leverage resources in other parts of the world to help them to enroll more students, also -- we can also leverage what they have. For example, from U.K. to China in terms of the teachers training, curriculum development and summer window camps. So it would be quite some synergy between the operations in China and also the operations in overseas. That will further increase our margin for both operations in China and overseas.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Kevin Li with China Renaissance.
Kevin Li: I just have a quick question on in terms of you have any thoughts on any share repurchase or dividend plans in the near future? So that's the first question. And the second question is, perhaps if you could sort of share with us the margin profile of the newly acquired entities, the recently acquired schools? And in terms of the margin trend going forward, what should we expect?
Dora Li: This is Dora. So for your first question regarding share repurchase, well, our share repurchase program has been completed, and we will not have -- we do not have authorization from the Board for any new program. It stopped. And second question regarding the overseas target margins, I think, Jerry just explain.
Jerry He: I can take that question. We are not in a position to disclose the numbers for our school now, but I can give you some general idea of where they are. Typically, if you -- we look at developed countries like U.K., U.S. and Canada, you're somewhere in the teens and/or low 20s. But I can't say too much about what's our numbers yet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. As there are no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Derek Feng for any closing remarks.
Derek Feng: Thank you very much for joining this conference call. Please feel free to contact us, if you have further questions. And we wish everyone a good day. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
