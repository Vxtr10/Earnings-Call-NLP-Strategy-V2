Robert Silberman: Thank you, Chris. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. After a fairly eventful year, we have quite a lot of material to cover. This morning, Carl will go over our operating and academic performance for twenty twenty and our plans for twenty twenty one. Dan will cover our detailed financial results. And finally, I will have some brief remarks on our capital allocation. And of course, we will stay for as long as you have questions, Karl. Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everyone. Karl McDonnellr: Obviously, 20/20 was a unique and challenging year and certainly unlike any year that I’ve ever had to manage through at the beginning of twenty twenty, both Strayer and Capelli universities were performing at peak level. Initiatives to drive improve learning outcomes and higher retention were effectively improving results following years of investments and new tools and technologies and technologies to simultaneously improve learning while increasing productivity. As the pandemic spread along with its associated economic impact, Strayer and Capello’s performance began to diverge quite significantly, driven by their differing student body composition, with Strayer serving predominantly an undergraduate population, the segment of the population most prone to adverse impacts from a deteriorating labor market. Significant new student declines in the third and fourth quarter led to a decline of nine percent in Strayer’s, total enrollment for the fourth quarter. Over the same period, Capello’s new student growth remained strong, resulting in total enrollment growth of five percent from the prior year. Notwithstanding Strayer’s adverse second half performance as. Daniel Jacksonr: Thanks, Carl, and good morning, everyone. I want to first point out that our consolidated results for the fourth quarter in the full year twenty twenty exclude the financial results of the Australian New Zealand acquisition prior to November 3rd, two thousand twenty four, a pro forma view of our full year. Twenty 20 segment level results. Please see the fourth quarter slide decks that we just posted to the investor relations section of our website. I also want to remind everyone that our adjusted results, which are non gabb, exclude charges and expenses that are non-recurring, including merger acquisition and restructuring related costs. Moving on to our fourth quarter results, adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter grew six percent to two hundred seventy eight point eight million, compared to two hundred sixty three point eight million in 2019, driven primarily by the inclusion of 35 million of revenue from our new Australian New Zealand division, offset by a 13 percent decline in revenue at Strayer University, Capelli University revenue was flat year over year as total enrollment growth of five percent was offset by lower revenue per student. The revenue per student decline at Capella was driven by growth employer affiliated enrollment, a trend we expect to continue into twenty twenty one. Our adjusted revenue for the quarter and the full year excludes the impact of an 11 million dollar deferred revenue adjustment related to the purchase. Accounting for our Australia New Zealand acquisition are just operating. Expenses for the fourth quarter increased fifteen percent to two hundred thirty one point six million, driven by the inclusion of Australia, New Zealand and partially offset by expense savings at Strayer University, which were primarily related to the restructuring that commenced in the third quarter of last year, the increase in operating expense resulted in a decline in adjusted operating income to forty seven point one million from sixty two point nine million in twenty nineteen. Our bad debt expense for the quarter was five point three percent of adjusted revenue, slightly higher than 2019, due primarily to student relief measures we implemented as a result of the pandemic. Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question to comment at this time, please press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If your question has been asked whether you wish to remove yourself from the queue, simply press the pound key again. If you have a question or comment at this time, please press star, then one on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Silber: Thank you so much. I believe you typically disclose new and continuing enrollment in your press release. I see it this time. Can you give it a little bit of color on how it did for both Strayer and Capelli University and also just the reasoning why it wasn’t disclosed? Thanks. Karl McDonnellr: Yeah, sure, Jeff. Happy to. First, regarding the actual performance, Strayer’s new student performance in the fourth quarter was essentially in line with the performance they had in the third quarter. Cappello was slightly better, so they got a little bit stronger. And the reason that we’ve adjusted our release is that we just feel like total enrollment is ultimately what drives revenue. It’s what we focus on from a management standpoint. Most of the students that are enrolled at any given time are continuing students and we want to focus on their retention. And so it just reflects the way that we think about the organization and how we actually manage it. Jeffrey Silber: Ok, fair enough. You know, there’s been a lot of noise about some of the proposals coming out in Washington that might seem to be favoring some of the nonprofit schools like community colleges, state universities. I’m just curious if you see more funding for those schools, what do you think it does to your company from a competitive perspective? Karl McDonnellr: Well, we’re confident that the value that we create for our students is quite high. And we’re always looking for ways to enhance the student experience with better teaching methodologies and other ways that we can enrich their experience. We’ve long now focused on the concept of creating economic mobility for students through education, and we feel as long as that we’re fulfilling that part of our mission will continue to create a lot of value for our students and be fine. Jeffrey Silber: Ok? And then finally, I’m sorry, the new segmentation, first of all, thank you in advance for releasing the data before you record earnings. I’m sure we’ll all appreciate that. But now that you’re going to highlight the alternative learning segment a little bit more, can we just get a little bit of a call? You talk about the CEO learning. We’ve got some good data over the past few years, but some of the new products that you’re offering are still relatively new to investors. Can we just get a little bit more color about what you have and how it stands out from a competitive area? Thanks. Karl McDonnellr: Sure. Happy to. The largest part of what will be alternative learning is what we refer to internally as employer solutions. And this is the group of people who work to liaise and work with the more than nine hundred corporate partners that we have in the organization. And so what we intend to do is to effectively transfer the revenue from the U.S. higher education division into alternative learning because it’s the alternative learning group that’s actually generating those corporate affiliated enrollments that will be the largest part of their revenue. But you also have Sophea and you’ll also have ultimately enrollment’s coming out of workforce edge, which is this education benefits management solution that we’ve rolled out quite successfully, even though it’s only been about a quarter. And part of that could be fees that we receive from nutile partner institutions. So if an employee that’s covered and a workforce edge elects to not enroll in or Strayer University and instead enroll in one of the new partner universities, that receiving institution of that new student pays us a fee. So it would be the combination of transfer pricing revenue from employer solutions to the workforce edge. All of that will comprise the alternative learning revenue base and of course, their direct expenses. Jeffrey Silber: Ok, great. And I know that we still haven’t gotten it data. Will you be releasing enrollment data going forward as well? Karl McDonnellr: We’re going to be releasing total enrollment within the division. Jeffrey Silber: Ok. All right, fantastic. I’ll jump back in the queue. Thanks so much. Karl McDonnellr: Thanks, Jeff. Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Tobey Sommer: Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss regulatory changes that you might expect, in particular changes to 90 10 and what percentage of enrollments are veterans for Strayer and Capela? Karl McDonnellr: Yeah, well specifically with respect to 90 10 Capella University, first of all, would have no issue there in the low 70s. Today they have a much smaller percentage of their total enrollment as either being active duty military or veterans. STRADER percentage is historically and currently higher and so they would be in the mid to high 80s. But we’re confident in our ability to manage that, particularly with respect to growing employer affiliated enrollments, which has always been one of our priorities and continues to be a priority for us this year. And to be clear, it’s mid to high 80s, including all the VA funded students. Slower than that now. Tobey Sommer: Thank you. And do you think on campus activities may be back to normal for the fall semester, or is that something you contemplated in the arc of guidance this year? Karl McDonnellr: We are optimistic that our campus network will be open by the end of the year. We have a couple of facilities that are open now. So we’ve taken a lot of precautions, both in terms of physical layout of space to make sure that we’re maximizing the safety of these physical locations. So we are actually now in the process of opening some. And it is our hope that the full network would be open, hopefully, maybe, perhaps in the latter half of the third quarter into the fourth quarter. Tobey Sommer: It could you talk about the what your expectation is for the resumption of international travel into Australia and New Zealand and what your plans are around that business and maybe broadening its geographic reach outside of those borders? Karl McDonnellr: Well, with respect to broadening the reach outside of their borders, they’ve effectively done that in 2020. So the Australian government provided relief from their educational visas, which allowed foreign students who historically would have to be in country to enroll in an Australian university. The government allowed them to stay in their native country and take Australian classes online. That already happened last year. We think that will continue at least through the first part of twenty twenty one. And based just on our sort of informal conversations with our local management team there, it’s our hope that the borders would begin to open to both foreign students and international travel in the second half of the year. And should it open sooner than the second half of the year? We think that that obviously would be favorable in terms of potential additional enrollment and revenue growth. Tobey Sommer: Thank you very much. Karl McDonnellr: Sure. Operator: Thank you again, ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or comment at this time, please press star zero, starting one on your telephone keypad. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee: Gary, back, and if you guys are happy about that, or probably the light delighted this guy again, but at any rate, it’s good to hear all your voices. And let me start with. Something that was has been a big part of the business, you know, even back in the days when I followed the company. Given the importance of potential students, you know, confidence in their in their employment prospects, I suspect that that that mix actually will have a lot to do with how quickly this can rebound. Can you share any of that with us? Karl McDonnellr: Yeah. I mean, first, I think the juxtaposition of Strayer’s, the results of A is an indication that they’re serving vastly different student bodies, which are dealing with the pandemic quite differently. And we know actually from polling and sampling existing Strayer’s students, there’s a high degree of anxiety even now about labor market job, their ability to maintain their income through the coming year. So there’s no doubt that that’s had a major impact on the results that we’ve seen. We’re certainly hopeful that as the pandemic begins to ease and vaccinations begin to spread and the labor market continues to recover, that ultimately that will start to show a return to growth at Strayer. And frankly, as I said in my prepared remarks, that’s what we are planning for. We are planning for that recovery to begin happening in the third quarter of this year. So we’ll have to wait and see a Jarius drop. Robert Silberman: The there is some geographic diversity in those states that remained open. There’s a little bit less pressure. But kind of the key short hand way to think about it is if somebody was in a job that they could do from home that it was a digitally enabled job, then they generally were able to keep their job and their employment confidence stayed high in large part of the Strier undergraduate pool of either the current students or prospective students or in jobs where that was not the case. They were not jobs that could be done from home. They weren’t digitally enabled. And as those as their places of work shut down, their employment shut down. And that’s really what reverberated through the straighteners. Student enrollment. Gary Bisbee: Yep. Yep. Makes sense. All right. Thanks, guys. Karl McDonnellr: Thanks, Gary. Robert Silberman: Thanks, Gary. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Pindi from Sidoti. Your line is open. Greg Pendy: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, just kind of wanted to dig into I think you mentioned Australia and New Zealand for the New Year would do it up a dollar 15 at EPS. Just wanted to understand, I guess, with the new administration how much of their growth was being fueled by foreign students choosing Australia. And is there any risk if the US becomes more relaxed on international student visas, that they may be looking to choose US schools over the Australia New Zealand school? Karl McDonnellr: I personally think that’s very unlikely. Australia has always been a major attraction for foreign students, for quality of life. The government has crafted a visa program that if you agree as a foreign student, to study one of, say, 30 or 40 different programs where the Australian government believes there’s significant job growth. If a student completes his or her study in that program, they’re granted residency, permanent residency status in Australia. Additionally, I think the way that they’ve handled the pandemic, both Australia and New Zealand would provide them with a safety premium, if you will, particularly against Western Europe, perhaps the United States for foreign students interested in migrating somewhere to attain a degree. So our view is that the foreign students will continue to have high demand, ultimately studying in Australia. And just for context, foreign students make up just over half of their student body. And as we’ve said, we expect certainly by the second half of this year for those students to be able to continue to immigrate into Australia and for that to continue to be a large source of their future growth. Robert Silberman: Great. And also it’s also geographically a lot closer to the major sources of international students. I think that’s an important point. Greg Pendy: Sure. No, that makes sense. So then I guess within that you mentioned the dollar 15 and EPS. I’m assuming that’s all Australia, New Zealand, not just Horan’s. Correct me if I’m wrong, but then in addition. So can you just give us a little bit of big picture color? I mean, the international student trends, do you think Will remain healthy, what the key drivers are, because it’s been a very high growth asset in the past in terms of enrollments, it looks like. So just trying to understand, you know, what can what can help create healthy growth in the future as well. Karl McDonnellr: Sure. It’s well, it is all three assets, so it’s taught in university think education in the media design school in New Zealand. And there’s only forty three, I guess, universities in Australia. So our combined assets have less than a two percent market share. The Australian higher education market continues to grow, you know, mid to high single digits annually. We think that it’s unlikely that you’re going to have other new entrants. And so the fact that you’ve got certainly with the case of Corones, which is by far the largest of these three assets, delivering very high quality programs, which they continue to roll out new programs, we think that these assets will continue to grow both by continuing to attract foreign students, but also by continuing to grow the domestic student base. As Torrance graduates, more students and those students fare well in the labor market and the reputation continues to grow on top of already being strong. We just think that it’s a great, great set of assets. The fundamentals are very sound from a supply demand standpoint, and we’re very confident in their long term growth. Robert Silberman: It just was one other sort of point to illuminate that is that the international students were cut off for most of 20, 20. A great deal of them were able to maintain enrollment through the online portal, as Karl said. But in the meantime, Torrence was able to grow at a very healthy rate, which meant that they were actually recruiting more students domestically in Australia. Greg Pendy: That’s very helpful. Thanks a lot. Sure. You bet. Operator: Thank you. We have a follow up question from Mr. Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities, your line is open. Tobey Sommer: I just want to revisit a topic historically, have new student enrollments been a good leading indicator for total enrollments? Karl McDonnellr: Well, sure, it depends a little bit on seasonality because some quarters are larger than others. But in our experience, it takes a relatively long time for a new student trend to ultimately shape the total enrollment, because it’s as I said earlier, it’s a small part of the total enrollment. So we would estimate that it would take anywhere from five to seven quarters of a particular new student trend to ultimately shape the total enrollment trend meaningfully. Tobey Sommer: It away that are you that arguably makes it a better leading indicator. So my follow up is why are you comfortable removing a leading indicator from the mosaic of investor information about the company’s performance while the company is in a difficult period? Robert Silberman: Well, first off, I wouldn’t say we’re in a difficult period. We’re very comfortable with wide ranging variability in student enrollment. And one of the most important things to understand about us as an enterprise is that we don’t try and drive student enrollment against underlying demand. In the long run, we find it’s the worst thing you can do for a university. You end up with underprepared students or students that aren’t committed in the way they need to be to be successful. So we have the financial strength and the diversity that we can, whether through wide variations as we have in the past. And to call those answers to just illuminate a little bit more on calls, answer. The best way to think about the leading indicator is depends on the average tenure of a student. If a student’s average tenure at a particular institution is, say, 10 quarters, then the individual Newstart enrollment in any given quarter is about one tenth of what that impact might be. And so, you know, it takes roughly a year or so of trend for it to have a meaningful impact. But the bottom line is, yes, it is a leading indicator from a financial standpoint, and you’ll see that flow through with regard to the total student enrollment. Karl McDonnellr: And Toby, small changes in retention of existing students is a much bigger driver than students historically is there are they are the two correlated positive changes in new student enrollment, in accompanying positive changes in retention? Or historically, do they move in different directions? They can move in different directions. In many quarters. They can both be up. It be quite rare to have a sustained trend where they were both down. I can’t really remember one, but they absolutely can move in different direction because there’s different things driving the behavior of the students. Tobey Sommer: Ok, thank you for your help. Robert Silberman: You bet. Operator: Thank you. I’m showing no additional questions in the queue at this time, I’d like to turn the conference over back to Mr. Roberts CEO for any closing remarks. Robert Silberman: Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of our shareholders. And if anybody has further questions, feel free to contact us and we’ll look forward to talking to you again in April at the annual meeting. Thank you. Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect everyone. Have a wonderful day."
