Amy Tung: Thank you, Carolyne, and welcome everyone. Good evening to those in America. We appreciate everyone's time. In 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic presented a series of challenges to people and businesses at a level that nobody could have predicted. The virus has had tragic consequences for so many. At ATA Creativity Global, we were very fortunate to have been in the position to navigate the changes created by the critical public health situation in China in the first half of 2020. Having closed on our acquisition of Huanqiuyimeng in early August of 2019; our two companies had substantially assimilated by early 2020, when the significance of the pandemic is becoming increasingly apparent. This played a key role in our successful transitioning, of coursework to the online platform.
Jun Zhang: Thank you, Amy. I think most everyone is glad to put 2020 behind us despite the valuable lessons we have learned. I'm proud of the way everyone at ACG came together to overcome the challenges we faced and I believe our company is now stronger for it. We utilize technology platforms that we can now leverage as a delivery method for various courses and majors which will allow us to not only reach a wider student population, but also enables us to take advantages of our teaching resources making highly sought after teachers available to students in our geographic areas who might not otherwise have had the opportunity to learn from these instructors. We now have a more convenient and accessible support system for students and are also developing an internal system to more closely monitor sales leads. While ACG is known for the personal attention of its programs, we believe this can also translate to online programs if executed properly. As the public health situation in China remain stable. The combination of being able to continue our traditional in person delivery of coursework, and serving students we may not have been able to serve previously via distance learning will help drive enrollment growth in future periods. The work we did in 2020 has positioned ACG well to capitalize on our growth opportunities in 2021. We were pleased to see enrollments remain stable during the fourth quarter with portfolio training credit hours increasing slightly as many students work to complete their portfolios. Some students have already begun to see the results of their hard work as acceptance letters from some institutions that started to go out, but the majority will be in the middle part of the year.
