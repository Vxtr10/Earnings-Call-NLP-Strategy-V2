With that, I will turn it over to Sima to our first quarter highlights.
Ruobai Sima: Okay. And thank you, Kevin, and for the kind introduction instruction. And I'd like to begin by sharing  and to be joining ACG at the time in its history. While we are being pleased with some challenges and caused by the ongoing pandemic environment and increasing competition. ACG has a strong track record of delivering positive student outcomes, and it is a reputable institution in the creative arts education space. And we are well positioned to overcome the short-term hurdles, and I'm very grateful to have this opportunity and to be a part of ACG's incredible bright future. 2022 got off to a very good start. And we saw a modest increase in student enrollment. Although credit hours delivered remaining stable during the fourth quarter, and we were able to achieve a 12.1% increase in net revenues as well as notable year-over-year improvement in gross profit and margin. This was primarily driven by increased revenue contribution and from our portfolio training and overseas study counseling services as well as continued product shifts and from time-based programs and towards project-based programs. In addition, our research-based learning opportunities have been well received by students and continue to be in high demand. As a few of our core cities are continue to face pandemic-related lockdown restrictions, and we are shifted our deliver method to online where appropriate, offering students and greater flexibility and ongoing support despite not being able to take in-person classes. Our core portfolio training program enrolled 537 students during the fourth quarter of 2022 and compared to 528 students in the prior year period. Enrollment tend to be an indicator and the future credit hours delivered, and we were placed that enrollments remaining stable year-over-year in parallel with resurgence of COVID-19 certain cities. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we delivered 27,494 credit hours for our portfolio training programs. Lower total credit hours remaining flat and we have continued to see an ongoing shift in our portfolio training and making favor of project-based programs versus realtime-based programs. And project-based programs or increased 23% and realtime-based programs decreased by 19%. Our continued effort to share the program is contributed to improve operational efficiencies and giving us the opportunity to grow revenue while improving gross margin. We have also continued to explore ways in which it ACG can better serve a great population of students from diverse backgrounds. We have received a positive feedback from the students and who are attending our International Arts Foundation Program centered in Beijing and Shuren-ACG Arts Center, both of which opened their doors in September 2021. In order to help students with diverse needs to pursue their further study goals in creative arts. And with that, let's move to financials and for the fourth quarter of 2022. Total net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 12.1% and to RMB 42.1 million and from RMB 37.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by an increase in service delivered for portfolio training and overseas study counselling. Portfolio training services and were delivered either important through ACG's nation-wide training center network or were online platform, which represented around 63.3% of total net revenue during the period. Gross margin improved to 45.7% during the 2022 first quarter, up from 39.6% in the prior year period. The improvement was primarily driven by various paths the increased proportion of revenues from portfolio training and overseas study counselling services. And improve our operating efficiencies and from ongoing shape of ACG's portfolio training program and mix towards project-based programs and related cost of optimization efforts. Net loss attributable to ACG improved to RMB 15.9 million and during the first quarter of 2022 and compared to RMB 19 million in the prior year period. And moving to the balance sheet, and we continue to be a solid financial position and raised USD 9.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Working capital deficit was USD 32.3 million, and total shareholders' equity was USD 27.6 million at March 31, 2022, compared to working capital deficit of USD 30.2 million and shareholders' equity of , respectively, and at December 31, 2021. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin, and he will depend upon our outlook and growth traffic. Kevin?
Kevin Ma: Thank you, Sima. We were pleased with the stable performance delivered in the first quarter of 2022. During the period, China experienced post loan related to local COVID-19 transmission in a few of our key cities like Shanghai, Shenzhen and Suzhou, which also led to certain travel restrictions across the country. The situation has since worsened with the mandatory lockdown, taking place in major cities. Some of our learning centers have had to close and cease in person's instruction, while we are still reinforcing service to our students in the cities where our campus has remained open. We are providing online class delivery option for students impacted by lockdowns in certain cities. In the short term, this may have an impact on business, there will always be students who prefer in-person instruction. However, we believe we will acted to overcome the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. The majority of our students are determined to continue pursuing their studies in the , and we are  support them to the best of our business. As Sima noted earlier, our research-based learning service, which tend to be good program that provides the project-based and learning experience remain quite popular. They originate the  to the pandemic, which drove more set to each of the students in terms of learning objectives to delivery forms and clear the project time. We are pleased to see a growing sentiment of online research-based learning programs in 2020 and are excited about it through growth potential beyond the post pandemic era. We are extremely proud of our students and intend to continue investing in our business and it's finishing partnership within the industry, which will serve as a foundation for our first future growth. We believe we are well positioned to grow our business with the current portfolio of program offerings as more countries began to ease travel restrictions. We believe that research-based learning and overseas counselling services business will be able to reach their full potential. While we are mindful of the -- there's computation within the -- remains our focus on serving our students and achieving their evolving needs. We are optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us in '22 and look forward to maintaining our leading position in creative arts education as we continue to drive positive outcomes for our students. I'd now like to hand the floor over to Jun Zhang, ACG's President to provide an update on our current growth initiatives. Jun will make his mark in Mandarin which will be followed by English translation. Jun, please go ahead.

We need to be nimble and flexible, the need to have a technologically  Delivery methods for our courses became absolutely clear when the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19 affected people all over the world over 2 years ago. We have continued to develop resources into quickly reacting to COVID-related  on our operations. And have remained focused on providing the best quality education services for our students, even when some of our campuses are temporarily closed due to local resurgence. ACG has continued to develop additional short-term programs, both online and in person where feasible, including online book camps, internships, domestic travel and certain team research-based learning programs. For example, during the first quarter, we organized an environmental protection culture and creative design camp at Xidao in Sanya, an island in Hainan province, offering a unique experience for over 20 students who are able to create recycling marine products and learn from local artist. The students have the opportunity to work on individual and group RPs and projects, and some of their work was selected into the exhibitions at the  protection center. This program was well received by the participating students. We believe the public health situation in China may improve over the next several weeks and remain optimistic about the remainder of 2022 as the situations pain and more cities -- major cities can resume some level of normalcy. We continue to plan for short-term summer camps and team travels in the coming summer. We're determined to continue to developing programs that cater to the needs of different student populations. And to support them in every way we can, like we always do, with the best quality education and teaching experiences. Our operational strength and growth prospects are based upon the experience of our veteran features are continuously evolving sales and marketing strategies to better resonate with the appropriate student population, our ongoing efforts to improve operating efficiencies as well as to establish relationships with domestic and international partners, including university and colleges, education institutions and international high schools in China and more. We believe we are well positioned financially in the near term, but have been exploring financing, investing and M&A opportunities where appropriate, to enable our long-term growth. ACG's mission is to provide quality learning experiences that cultivate and enhance students' creativity. We're confident in our ability to maintain our competitive advantages and leading position in the creative arts education market in China. In 2022, we look forward to serving a growing population of students with diversified needs in pursuing the creative arts education. With that, I'll turn it back over to Kevin.
