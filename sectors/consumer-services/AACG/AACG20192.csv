Net loss from continuing operations attributable to ATA was RMB 18.2 million, compared to RMB 16.4 million in the prior year period, primarily due to an RMB 1.1 million decrease in net rental income and RMB 2.5 million increase in legal and consulting fees associated with the acquisition activities of new business.Lastly, we continue to be in a strong financial position with US$19.2 million in cash and cash equivalent and no long term or short term debt at June 30 2019.We provide additional detail on our capital position and balance sheet on Slide 6.

Kevin Ma: Thank you, Amy. For those of you following along, I will begin with Slide 8. As we have stated in past quarters the steep growing international education market is where ATA has been courting its focus.China is the number one market of students studying internationally. And as a shown on this slide, the number of Chinese students pursuing overseas studies continues to grow each year with over 662,000 students studying abroad in 2018. We are thrilled to have real detail as to the closing ATA's acquisition of approximately 87% to equity interest in ACG. We are working to close on the remaining 12% or so equity interest and expect to have this completed before the end of the third quarter.Details surrounding the terms can be found in last week's press release. And we are happy to answer questions during Q&A as well.Moving to Slide 9, this transaction is our first step towards our long term objective of becoming a leading international education service provider. We look forward to working closely with ACG team on taking advantage of their reputable degree of education market. We can find the overview of ACG on Slide 10.To discuss the details of ACG's structure, initiatives, I'd like to introduce Mr. Jun Zhang, ATA's newly appointed President and Director. Jun is the founder of ACG and has leaded the organization success. Jun holds over 20 years of experience in art education and is a recognized expert in China's art education industry. He is a panel in the industrialization of international art education in China and has been very involved with the arts in China both professionally and as an educator.With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jun to expand upon ACG's strategy growth initiatives. Jun will make his remarks in Mandarin, which will be followed by an English translation.
Jun Zhang: Thank you, Kevin for that time introduction. I am very pleased to be joining ATA at this exciting juncture in both of our companies' history. As you can see on Slide 9, we have four major growth initiatives. The first is rather simple, geographic growth. We are working to maximize the growth of our existing centers in China and plan to selectively open centers in China and overseas in the years to come. So we may provide our students with additional programming and tailored services such as language education.Second is product expansion. We are looking to introduce themed art tour and research products for niche market clients, as well as programming for students of different ages group.Third, we expect our business model to evolve to accommodate and catalyze growth domestically. Our current products cater to those living in first and second tier cities. But as we expand our product offerings and sales channels, we aim to gradually expand our reach to more second and third tier cities. We believe doing so will lead to progressively increased market share.Finally, we continue looking for M&A opportunities and partnerships within the art education market, both domestic and overseas. We believe successful acquisitions or partnerships further enhance our growth and value as we move forward with our other growth initiatives. And look forward to providing the investment communities with updates on our progress on these initiatives in the coming months and sharing more details surrounding our operations and economics. Kevin?
Kevin Ma: Thanks for that Jun. Including We are very excited to have part ACG about the initiative in place to grow ACG's market share in the rapid growing education market. We look forward to utilizing our strong background in education technologies and service as well as our industry relationships to go forward the components, the geography and the programmatic expansion.ATA's overall objective in a growth strategy is outlined on Slide 11. And as we will close with ACG, we continue to explore M&A opportunities within the education space that may be a good fit with our business portfolio. We have plans to be in the US later this year. And look forward to visiting with investors.With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: There are no questions in the queue. Thank you so much.
Kevin Ma: Thanks again to all of you for joining us. If anyone has questions for us, please feel free to reach out directly to us or our investor relations firm, The Equity Group.
