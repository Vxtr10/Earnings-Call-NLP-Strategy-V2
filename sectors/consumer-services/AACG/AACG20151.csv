Benson Tsang: Thank you, Carolyne, and good morning, everyone. Today we will provide an overview of our operating and financial highlights for first quarter 2015 and then discuss our outlook for fiscal year 2015. I would like to begin on Slide 5, which lists some of our operating highlights for first quarter 2015. We were pleased with the exam volume growth ATA achieved during the period. We delivered 2.3 million billable exams, a 6.2% increase from first quarter 2014, most of which were related to the finance industry. We continued efforts to establish new client relationships through the first quarter 2015 and began working for the Tianjin Commodity Traders Association for wholly administered computer-based qualification exams. We also delivered the National College Students Futures and Derivatives Knowledge Competition with comprehensive computer-based testing services for the China Financial Futures Exchange. We are excited to have recently announced a new joint venture with New Oriental, China's largest provider of private educational services, which will help ATA expand into online education and training. The joint venture is expected to develop an online education and training website focused on serving the workforce in China, initially targeting the healthcare, accounting and finance industry. We anticipate the new online education and training website will launch by the end of 2014. The partnership is a step in ATA's overall growth strategy, which we can expand upon when it goes over the outlook for fiscal year 2015. In June, ATA introduced its own mobile app called Kao Shi Dao Hang, which translates into Exam Inventory Navigator in English. This new app is an excellent navigation tool that allows users get down with their mobile devices to access information on the terms being administered throughout China such as pricing, date and location on the go. On the right-hand side of the presentation is a map of our extensive nationwide network of over 3,000 test centers, which enable ATA to deliver large-scale attempts simultaneously and cost effectively for clients. We believe we are the only provider of this kind of large scale testing solution in China. Moving on to our financial highlights for the quarter, as shown on Slide 6. We exhibit our net revenue guidance for first quarter of 2015. Net revenues for the quarter were impacted by the termination of the exclusive distributor contracts between ETS and ATA for TOEIC and its related products in fiscal 2014. But we anticipate that the steps for this contract termination will anticipate as we progress with our new initiatives and establish business relationships with existing customers in fiscal 2015. We were able to achieve gross margin improvement in first quarter 2015 as a result of continued improvement in service, delivery, efficiency and decreased TOEIC exam royalties to ETS. Lastly, we are reiterating our net revenue and non-GAAP net income guidance for fiscal year 2015, which we announced during our previous earnings release. On the next slide, we break our revenues for first quarter 2015 by businesses, which can be broken down broadly into two areas: testing services and test preparation and training solutions. At 94%, our core business of testing services was a significant percentage of our total revenue in the 2015 first quarter. On the next slide, we have provided a breakdown of the company's financial results for the quarter. Gross profit stayed relatively flat at RMB47.5 million compared to RMB48.1 million in the prior-year period. Gross margin for first quarter 2015 improved to 56.3% compared to 52.2% in the prior-year period for the reasons I stated earlier. Net income was RMB4.6 million compared to RMB9.4 million in the prior-year period as a result of decreased revenues and increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. According to US GAAP, we have reported that dividend declared of approximately $9.6 million in this quarter as a result of our diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.18 in first quarter 2015 compared to RMB0.40 in the prior-year period. Please turn to Slide 9. Here we provide a supplemental chart of quarterly numbers adjusted for share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. I would like to highlight that excluding these items, our total net income for first quarter 2015 was RMB8.7 million compared to RMB11.1 million in the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per ADS during first quarter 2015 on a non-GAAP basis was RMB0.36 compared to RMB0.48 in the prior-year period. We continued to be supported by free cash flow and a solid balance sheet, which we have highlighted on Slide 10. As of June 30, 2014, we had about $54 million in cash. We have no long-term debt or short-term borrowings and continue to follow the strict cost structure that has served us well over the past several years. ATA's Board of Directors have approved a share repurchase plan effective immediately. The company is authorized to repurchase up to $5 million worth of its issued and outstanding. And the plan is set through January 31, 2015. Slide 11 shows our annual guidance for fiscal year 2015. We reiterate our expectation of net revenues between RMB385 million to RMB405 million and non-GAAP net income guidance between RMB28 million and RMB38 million, which improves about RMB30 million to maintain and expand our businesses. We expect second quarter net revenues will be in the range of RMB90 million to RMB100 million, which you will notice is much higher than revenues achieved in the fiscal 2014 second quarter. This increase is due to the CPA exam taken place during second quarter 2015, for which we expect to recognize revenues during the period. In previous years, the CPA exam has taken place during our fiscal third quarter. Just to remind that this guidance is based on our own internal projections and we will continue to evaluate our projection on an ongoing basis. With that, I would like to turn it over to our CEO, Mr. Cheng-Yaw Sun to provide some more detail on our outlook for fiscal year 2015.
Cheng-Yaw Sun: Thank you, Benson. We were pleased with the exam volume growth we achieved in first quarter 2015. We are working on a number of new initiatives that we believe will properly position ATA for the next stage of growth. In addition to continuing to invest in our technologies this fiscal year, we will provide our clients and test sponsors with the latest assessment ability to (inaudible).
