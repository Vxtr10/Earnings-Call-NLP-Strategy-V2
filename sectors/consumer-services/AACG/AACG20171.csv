Shelly Jiang: Thank you, Katherine and welcome everyone. Today, I will provide an overview of our operating and financial highlights and then briefly provide an update on our outlook for fiscal year 2017. I will begin on Slide 5 which leads to some of our operating highlights for the first of quarter. The first quarter was an excellent one for ATA as we exhibit our previously announced guidance range for quarterly revenue and a continued pushing forward on new business development efforts that we believe will have a lasting impact throughout fiscal year 2017. In yesterday’s press release we announced that ATA was recently selected by the China National Tourism administration to be the service provider for the national tour guide [Technical Difficulty] exam, which we expect to deliver in November 2016. In June the company was also chosen by four well known Chinese universities in closing Northwest University and Zhongnan University of Economics and Law to deliver exams and or to develop certain exam content for now. During the first quarter 2017, ATA successfully delivered a new exam Tito, the qualification exam for housing and urban rural construction field professionals of Sichuan Province and the Ningxia Autonomous region. We worked closely when capital sponsors to convert this exam from its original computer-based formats to ATA’s technology based platforms and look forward to continuing this relationship in the quarters to come. Overall, ATA delivered approximately 2.6 million billable exams during first quarter 2017, compared to 2.6 million billable exams in the first quarter of 2016. Exam volume for the period were relatively flat despite of the loss of the security appreciation of China exam for calendar year 2016 through 2017, which was mostly offset by volumes from new exams such as the Fund Practitioners Certification Exam. We have been working closely with the Asset Management Association of China we call it AMAC, which will presents China’s mutual fund industry. Over the past few quarters, to ensure the smooth administration and delivery of the Fund Certification Exam. It has been a productive relationship for both parties thus far and we look forward to growing this partnership with AMAC in the years to come. Moving on to Slide 6, which lists of financial highlights for effective foreign currency. As reported, net revenue RMB96.8 million for the period. We beat our guidance range of RMB87 million to RMB92 million, and compared to net revenues of RMB97.5 million in the prior year period. Gross margin for first quarter 2017 was 49.6%, compared to 55.5% in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the change in revenue mix and increased expenses related to additional operations staffing. We reported net income of RMB4.1 million in the first quarter 2017, which compared to RMB6.1 million in the prior year period. Our bottom-line were impacted by increased losses incurred by the company’s joint venture and associated companies focused on the education and recruitment markets. Following our profit for first quarter, the company is reiterating its previously announced net revenues and non-GAAP net income guidance range for fiscal year 2017, which I will discuss in further detail later on this call. On the next slide, we breakout revenues for first quarter 2017 by our businesses, which can be divided into two areas, testing services and online education services. Testing services accounted for about 92.5% of revenues in first quarter 2017. On Slide 8, we provide a breakdown of the company’s financial result for first quarter 2017. As this information have been fully detailed in our earnings release, I won’t repeat the numbers here, but I’m happy to take any questions on this information during Q&A. Moving to Slide 9, we provide a supplemental chart of quarterly numbers adjusted for share based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gains or losses. Excluding this item, adjusted net income for first quarter 2017 was RMB5.2 million, or US$0.8 million compared to RMB10 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per ADS during first quarter 2017 on a non-GAAP basis were RMB0.22, compared to RMB0.44 in the prior-year period. We continue to be supported by free cash flow and a solid balance sheet, which we have highlighted on Slide 10. As of June 30, 2016, we had about US$18 million in cash and cash equivalents. Some of you may have noted that the decrease in cash and cash equivalent from about RMB248 million as of March 31st, 2016 to RMB119.5 million as of June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in long-term investment related to ATA’s recent strategy investment in a number our education companies, which Kevin will expand upon in a moment and RMB30 million cash reserve set aside as a domestic [indiscernible] in China. That allows the company to obtain and obviously small for general working capital purposes in its international business. This cash reserve is for the current securing and obviously credit line with U.S. dollar for meeting. After June 30, 2016, we have withdrawn US$0.5 million from the total credit rolls. As shown on Slide 11, we expect second quarter 2017, net revenues will be in the range of RMB58 million to RMB68 million. As previously announced, we expect fiscal year 2017 on revenues to be between RMB429 million and RMB440 million. And non-GAAP net income guidance to be between RMB27 million and RMB37 million, which takes into account the operating results of a joint venture and our associated companies focused on the education and recruitment market, all of which are at an early stage of business development. The company is exploring growth opportunities in the K-12, education assessment and recruitment sector during fiscal year 2017 and plans to invest RMB20 million and RMB30 million in such sectors, which is not included in any other fiscal year 2017 guidance. Please keep in mind that this guidance is based on our own internal projections and that we will continue to evaluate our projections on a ongoing basis. With that, I would like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO Mr. Kevin Ma to provide some more details on our growth strategy and outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond.
Kevin Xiaofeng Ma: Thank you Jiang. The company’s primary growth drivers in the coming quarters will be [indiscernible] development and more entice new business and relationships with a focus on improving our core testing services business in fiscal year 2017. On Slide 13 of our presentation, is a list of some of our overall growth strategies.
