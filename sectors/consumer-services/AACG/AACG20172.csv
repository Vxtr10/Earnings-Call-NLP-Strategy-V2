Kevin Ma: Thank you, Carolyne, and welcome everyone. ATA's mission that is founding the early 20 years ago has been to help students, jobseekers, working professionals and people from all works of life in China pursue and achieve their education and professional goals. Over the past year, China's education system has seen much change due to the policy reform. The shift and intention of China's current examination system is one area of focus for such reform. The Minister of Education has stated that learning recur thorough accurate and effective assessment throughout the learning process. It cannot be judged surely based on test scores. Stakeholders in China’s education market including parents, teachers and schools tend to be opened to the instruction of more testing products and services to promote adoptive learning as students grow and develop. There has been an ongoing effort to inspirit education, technologies into all levels of education and off school tutorial offerings as a leading provider of large scale computer-based testing services in China. ATA is well positioned to take advantage of this variable market environment. In this regard, we’ve entered into a five-year partnership with Tsinghua University while offer most facilities to institutions for higher education in China. In the areas of content development and education research and doing so, we believe we can continue to strengthen ATA's portfolio of test tiles and view their foundation for business growth in the foreseeable future. We are excited about the prospects of this partnership and we look forward to being involved in the future of education and assessment reforms in China and beyond. I would now like to turn the call over Amy, who will go over operational and the financial highlights for June 30th period.
Amy Tung: Thank you, Kevin, and hello everyone. Today, I will provide an overview of our operating and financial highlights and then briefly provide an update on our outlook for the remaining six months of nine months transition period and in December 31, 2017. We’ll begin in Slide 5. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, ATA delivered 3.6 million billable tests compared to $2.6 million in the prior year period.

These new exams are contributed to the revenue increase during period. As Kevin mentioned, we began working with Tsinghua earlier this year. ATA has committed to support the establishment of the Research Institute of Future Education and Assessment at Tsinghua University. This institute was founded with ATA’s initial financial contribution in April and aims to become a first class research platform focused on truly best practices and assessments in this new era of education. ATA has agreed to make a financial contribution to this project each year.

Net loss attributable to ATA Inc. for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was RMB8.5 million compared to net income attributable to ATA Inc. of RMB4.1 million in the prior year period, primarily due to increased share based compensation expense related to near share options that were issued in January 2017 and the RMB10 million expenditure related to the Tsinghua University partnership.
