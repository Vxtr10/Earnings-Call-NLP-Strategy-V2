Ruobai Sima: Thank you, Alice, and welcome, everyone, and good evening to those in America, and we appreciate everyone's time. And during the second quarter of 2022, and we were pleased that we continue supporting our students who chose to continue fulfilling their creative art education while online deliveries and due to local resurgence of COVID-19 in some of our core critics, including Shanghai and Beijing. For late March to early June, we temporarily closed some of our training centers to comply with local lockdown procedures. We are pleased that these restrictions have since been lifted, and we are able to serve our students in person like again. Total studio enrollment remained stable at 1,018 during the period compared to 1,051 in the second quarter of 2021. As a result of temporary training center closures and future lockdowns, total credit hours delivered for portfolio training program decreased by 10.8% compared to prior year period, which impacted our financials during the period. The impact on portfolio training and research-based learning revenues were partially offset by increased revenue contributions from overseas study counselling services with the public health situation in China improving once again. We expect demand for our portfolio training and research-based learning programs to rebound. We continue to see significant demand for oversea study program, and we are confident in ACG's ability to increase its market share in the international Creative Arts education industry. During the second quarter of 2022, we delivered a total of 25,387 credit hours for our portfolio training programs. We have continued to encourage the ongoing shift in our portfolio training mix in favor of project-based program versus time-based programs. This is evident in the breakdown, we are project-based programs, credit hours account for 57.8% of total credit hours delivered during the period. With that, let's move to financial highlights for the second quarter and first half over year. Total net revenue for the second quarter of 2022 were RMB 34 million compared to RMB 36.9 million in the second quarter of 2021. As mentioned earlier, the decrease was primarily due to the decreased contribution from the portfolio training and research-based learning services that were impacted by local COVID-19 resurgence and subsequent lockdowns in some of our key cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. Gross margin was 35.6%, compared to 43.4% in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues during the period, will cost of revenues remained relatively stable year-over-year. Net loss attributable to ACG was RMB 22.1 million, which compared to a net income attributable ACG of RMB 14.1 million in the prior year period. The difference here was primarily due to a onetime investment gain for RMB 33.5 million, as a result of the disposal of the company's K-12 education assessment business in the second quarter of 2021. Turning to the first half of 2022. Net revenue increased slightly to RMB 76.2 million, compared to RMB 74.4 million in the same period of 2021. Gross margin remained stable at 41.2% compared to 41.5% in the prior year period. Net loss attributable to ACG was RMB 37.9 million compared to RMB 4.9 million. Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to be in our solid financial position with USD 9 million in cash and cash equivalents. Working capital adjusted was USD 33.4 million, and total shareholder equity were USD 22.9 million at June 30, 2022, compared to working capital deficit of USD 30.2 million and shareholder equity of USD 30 million, respectively at December 31, 2021.

Our vision is to deliver the qualities quicker and ongoing support for our students regardless of whether it's in-person or remote.
