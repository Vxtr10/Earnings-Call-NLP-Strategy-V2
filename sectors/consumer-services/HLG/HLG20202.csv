Revenue from educational training services was RMB43.4 million or $6.2 million, a decrease of 27.4% from RMB59.8 million for the same period of last year, mainly due to the termination of our educational training business in Jiangxi Province.With expansion of our study trip services, the revenue reached RMB43.1 million or $6.2 million, an increase of 62.6% from RMB26.5 million for the same period of last year. We provide a variety of education and management services to our schools located in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei and Shandong provinces.

Selling expenses were RMB15.1 million or $2.2 million, an increase of 52.5% from RMB9.9 million for the same period of last year. The increase was mainly attributed to the increasing sales compensation payment related to educational training services.

Net cash provided by operating activity was RMB476.1 million or $68.4 million, a decrease of 26.4% from RMB646.9 million for the same period of last year.

Net cash used in financing activities was RMB51.8 million or $7.4 million, compared with RMB7.3 million for the same period of last year. The increase was mainly due to more dividends paid by the subsidiary of HLG to non-controlling interests and loan repayment to the related party.Now I would like to turn the discussion over to the operator for any questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Eva Nu [ph], a private investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good day, management. I am Eva Nu, an individual investor. As we all know, the COVID-19 continues to spread and affects lots of industries. Could you please introduce the impact on HLG and the education industry? Thank you.
Litao Qiu: Okay. Let me answer this question. This is Litao Qiu. I am the Board Secretary. Thank you for your question. Well, due to the COVID-19 epidemic issue, we were actually informed by the local government to postpone the new term onsite class start date. So instead, we provide Internet real-time class lessons to our students by each subject teachers based on the each original class, thanks for the IT strategy and support and our strong teaching team, comprehensive teaching material.As of February 2020, we had more than 2,000 teachers and nearly 38,000 students who are participating in all your real-time lessons by using our jointly developed Hailiang VIP Cloud Virtual Classroom software platform. Since we do not receive any official notice about a new term start date and end date of this semester, so we cannot provide the actual figures on the latest impact at this moment. But we will continually monitor the progress of the epidemic and timely disclose the impact we saw of the outbreak on our business. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Simon Chen [ph], a private investor. Please go ahead.

More specifically, as we mentioned in our 6-K, our revenue increased by 12.9% while our cost and expenses only increased by 9.7%.The increase in revenue was mainly due to the 4.6% increase in the number of students enrolled and the 9.7% increase in the average tuition and the expansions of our study trips and overseas study consulting services.

Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Jack Yu [ph], a private investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. As new media workers, I want to know what's the strategy of the company's online education? Thank you.
Litao Qiu: Okay. This is Litao Qiu. I am the Board Secretary. Let me answer this question. Actually, our company's online education strategy is mainly in three key areas. The first one is the technology side. Since we have a fully prepared a system, so during the outbreak of the COVID-19, we actually launched the Hailiang VIP Cloud Virtual Classroom platform to all the students. We have set up more than 1,500 virtual classrooms running more than 67,000 lessons with great result.Actually, in the biggest single classroom lesson, we had more than one million participants which was conducted by our executive principal, Mr. Ye, a few weeks ago. The new system not only helped to keep our student's study progress in line with the schedule, but also to speed up at least one to two years of the cloud systems deployment time among the education group.And the second area, which is the curriculum and teaching resources side, during the outbreak of COVID-19, our online education has covered almost 100% of the compulsory class lessons. In addition, we have more than 200 elective courses and other specified courses delivered by 15 of our golden Olympiad competition training coaches and also 133 senior teachers. Those comprehensive curriculums will expand our online teaching resources in the future.And the third part is the teaching innovation side. We will take advantage of the flexibility of online education system, increase the proportion of the online lessons and leave more time for students to communicate with their teachers and classmates, enable teachers to give students and target guidance. We can also integrate high quality domestic and foreign teaching resources teachers in China or overseas through online education platform to deliver excellent lessons to local and foreign country students.So in short, online education service is one of the key focus of our business. We will continue invest on the technology development of the software platform to enrich the teaching content and also to innovate our Hailiang OMO, which is Online-Merge-Offline, new teaching approach to quickly increase the number of online students in our school as well as other school students to improve our future revenues.So this is my answer to your question. Thank you.
