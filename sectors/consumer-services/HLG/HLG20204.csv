I appreciate your continuous support and attention to Hailiang Education and I welcome all of you to visit Hailiang Education and meet in person in the future. Now I will move back to our business review. In the past fiscal year, our performance has been strong and stable demonstrating our continuous progress in executing and innovating our growth strategy and highlighting the resilience of our underlying business despite temporary disruption and a short-term impact on our business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the fiscal year 2020 our revenue was RMB1,482.6 million, slightly decreased by 1.1% year-on-year from RMB1,499 million. However, the decline was mainly due to non-K-12 educational services which was impacted by COVID-19 and our revenue from K-12 educational services was RMB1,308, increased from RMB1,217 million year-on-year. Our net profit attributable to Company's shareholders was RMB370.8 million, increased by 26.4% year-on-year from RMB293.4 million. Our gross profit margin was 33.7% and net profit margin was 25%, increased from 31.5% and 19.6% respectively. In addition, we are pleased to have the celebration of our 25th Anniversary in 2020.

When the outbreak of COVID-19 first appeared, with careful and proactive arrangements and deployments, we regarded the safety and health of all our students and employees as top priority and made appropriate short-term adjustments to our business operations when needed. To reduce the negative impact of COVID-19 on planned teaching progress of the Spring semester, we launched 'Hailiang VIP Cloud Virtual Classroom' in February 2020 to ensure that our students could continue their courses as planned before the outbreak of COVID-19 via online live classes. Benefiting from our abundant educational services, outstanding facility capabilities, and technical advantages in IT infrastructure, our online education services and ""Smart Campus"" platform have thrived during the outbreak of COVID-19.

Beginning from year 2021 we plan to open 10 learning center each fiscal year based on our internal financial model. Mingyou species will undoubtedly be one of many key revenue growth drivers in the next few years. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Maggie Zheng with Cantor Investment [ph]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you, operator. Good evening management. This is Maggie from Cantor Investment. We would like to know what is the impact of COVID-19 on company's financial performance for this fiscal year? Thank you.
Jianguo Yu: Hi, I am Jianguo Yu, I am the CFO, I will answer this question. Thank you very much. The outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted our business lines, especially our K-12 educational service and study services. For our K-12 educational services, we launched online education and tutoring platform, which enabled our teachers and our educational staffs to provide our regional curriculums to their students online while our schools was not allowed to operate in-person teaching classes. As a result, the only refund of accommodation and transportation services was accrued for RMB29.5 million which has been a limited impact on our revenue from K-12 educational services. Besides the revenue from K-12 education services for high school level of RMB32.3 million was deferred to the next fiscal year due to the delay of school year and middle and the price of primary school was not significantly impacted. For study trip services, the revenue was decreased by 30.8% or RMB25.1 million year-to-year. Due to the current regulation and the travel restrictions imposed by the Chinese government and authority, revenue from onsite education training services declined to a certain extent due to the suspension of a physical class during the pandemic period. Despite of the pandemic, our gross profit increased by 5.8% or RMB499.4 million to net profit attributed to our shareholders increased by 26.4% to RMB370.8 million in the fiscal year 2020. I hope that answer your question and thank you very much. Operator.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Eric Lee, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you operator. Hi management. My name is Eric who is a Private Investor. So we know that the company has a certain number of the related party transactions. How does a company ensure the fairness of the related party transactions? Thank you.
Jianguo Yu: Hi, I am Jianguo Yu, I am the CFO. Let me answer this question for you. Thank you very much. To improve the transparency and fairness of related party transactions, we are taking the following steps to address your concerns. We will make a price of related party transactions according to the market price of similar products or services and conduct internal evaluation of the pricing regularly. We will involve a third party to make assessment on the pricing or the fairness. The management will issue formal management opinions on all related party transactions and all related party transactions are approved by our audit committee and Board of Directors in advance. We disclose the detail of all our related party transactions in our financial statements annually to our investors and thank you very much for the questions and we're looking forward to meet you again. Operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ivy Wan [ph] with Universe Securities. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you, operator. Hi everyone from Universe Securities. I have several questions. So my first question is, are there any detailed points or assumptions [ph] for revitalizing -- underdeveloped regions or are there any plans or strategic, acquisitions to expand our school network across first tier and the capital cities? Thank you.
Dr. Junwei Chen: Thank you. This is Dr. Chen and I will take this question. Yes, the education and revitalization of underdeveloped regions will be one of the three key actions to be launched in the coming fiscal year. While the education resources in underdeveloped regions are well below the average of China, Hailiang Education has a very good position to export our experiences, education, and the management system and education technology to these regions. By liaising with Hailiang Group we could establish K-12 schools in underdeveloped regions without spending heavy capital expenditures and form a career platform to attract graduates from top universities to work in these underdeveloped regions. And as a result, we could improve education, quality of local schools, and through the application of our education technology and the early education services with a student and teacher platform composed of a vast population of students in public and private schools of underdeveloped regions. And at the same time, our business model can be expanded and replicated to these regions successfully. At the same time, expansion in first tier or large cities in China is also one of our key options in the next few years, as what we did before we will continue to evaluate and explore opportunities in the development of large cities in China and potentially acquire, establish, or operate and manage additional schools in these cases in these regions to expand our school networks in China. I hope I can answer your questions.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you. That's good to know. So my second question is, I know you have already moved to online classes so what processes are in place, where are you looking to implement to maintain your standards of teaching? Thank you.
Litao Qiu: Okay, first of all, this is Litao Qiu, I am the Board Secretary. Let me answer your question. First of all, all student and teacher activities are already actually returned back to normal. But during the outbreak of COVID-19, we launched the Hailiang VIP class, virtual classroom in February 2020 to ensure that our students could continue their courses as planned before the outbreak of COVID-19 via the online lifestyle classes. All teachers were trained to master online education platform and standard training course wear and efforts were implemented across our affiliates and managed schools. I hope this can answer your question. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah. Yeah, thank you. So can you give us some updates on sports or other after school activities you have when you entered online classes and thank you?
Litao Qiu: Oh, okay. As I just mentioned all our student and teacher activities already back, returned to normal, but during the outbreak of COVID-19 heavy periods we actually deliver our after school activity for the online interactive system. And according to the feedback from the students, they are quite happy with this arrangement. Yes, thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thanks a lot. So thank you. My next question is about our Singapore expansion. So do you view the international expansion international growth segments for our company to move forward and if so is the East Asia the focus for international growth? Thank you.
Dr. Junwei Chen: This is Dr. Chen and I will take this question. Yes, international expansion is also one of our three strategic actions in the next five years. Regarding our international expansion strategies we will extend outside China in two different aspects. For once the [indiscernible] we will continue to look at opportunities in some developed countries, which are the destination countries of our international programs, including UK, Singapore, Australia, and potentially U.S. By expanding into these countries we will acquire some boutique K-12 schools there to achieve some synergy with our existing business in China. We can send our existing students to have study trips in these overseas schools and send some of our students to study in these schools, in high school grades and also on the other side these schools can provide improvement to our existing international curriculum and also help training international students -- teachers in our existing network. That's one aspect. And for the other aspect, we will continue to explore opportunities in the road and belt initiative countries. Currently, we have observed that there are great demands of studying in China or studying in China studying curriculums with some China elements in this road and belt initiative countries. Right now we have an international graduate students college in our Zhuji campus, and most of these students are from families in these road and belt initiative countries. So we believe that by establishing schools in these countries Hailiang can quickly export our education philosophy and principles in these countries and generate substantial interest from these -- from citizens in these countries. Yes, that's a brief summary of our international expansion strategies.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you very much for a detailed explanation. So my last question is about our educational training services. So what can you attribute to the high rate of growth for this sector before the shutdown of Jiangxi Haibo Education Management, do you expect this growth to continue in the future and thank you very much?
Dr. Junwei Chen: Okay, yeah, I will also take this question. Yes, the educational training for this segment will continue to be a main course driver for our business in the next few years. In the past few months, we have successfully established three learning centers in Zhuji and Hangzhou where our K-12 schools are already located. And in the upcoming fiscal year, we will continue to replicate to this business models in regions that are adjacent to our existing schools. By taking these strategies and achieve synergy with our existing schools, including cost sharing, student recruitment, etc., we believe that our new established learning centers can generate a relatively high growth and net margin to our entire group. So with the contribution of these new offline and online training centers, these segments of business will continue to generate a substantial contribution to our overall financial performances, well, very positive to the development of this sector in upcoming fiscal year.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you. That's all my questions. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Seeing no further questions, let me turn the call over to Mr. Litao Qiu, to our Board Director for closing remarks.
