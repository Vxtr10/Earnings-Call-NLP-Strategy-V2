Tongbo Liu: Thank you, Yuhua. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Sunlands first quarter 2022 conference call. We are shaken by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the geopolitical conflicts. We are all facing huge macro-economic uncertainties. In tough times, I believe -- we believe the key to  is to remain focused on cost efficient spending and profitability, which will help us  get us through this difficult period. To that end, we continue to execute our business goals and profitability strategy during the first quarter. Thanks to our strategic efforts, we are pleased to have carried our momentum in 2022 with our first quarter net profit hitting a new high of RMB179.4 million, a significant improvement compared to a net loss of RMB53.3 million in the prior year period and 19% higher quarter-over-quarter. As we're focused on healthy and sustainable growth, we stepped up our cost management  and emphasized student acquisition efficiency. As such, we reduced our general and administrative expenses by 9.1% year-over-year. We also strategically scaled back on our marketing activities, as evidenced by a 51.4% year-over-year decrease in sales and marketing expenses. This led to 19.5% and 34.2% year-over-year decrease in new student enrollments and gross billings, respectively. We should note, however, as a percentage increase in our new student enrollment and gross billings are much smaller than our percentage savings in marketing spending, which is due to our improvement student acquisition efficiency as we made efforts to captivate new students and increases their lifetime value and stickiness by holding our course offerings to cater to our students different -- differentiated learning needs. Our balanced growth was also driven by our extensive premium course resources, which continue to effectively fulfill our students' learning demands. During the first quarter, we forge ahead amidst  a challenging macro environment, optimizing our product mix and expanding our course catalogs to our master's degree-oriented and professional skills programs, while striving to provide our students with an optimal and efficient learning experience. In light of the increasing tough job market, in the first quarter, we concentrated more on designing and developing new courses to provide a diverse range of skills training for our students to enhance their overall competitiveness and thereby increase their employment opportunities. Moving on to each of our major course programs. As our work and social lives are shaped by the persistent epidemic and accelerated digital transformation, the job market is rapidly evolving amidst a shifting macro economy landscape and people's way of living life is also changing. Working professionals tend to  to stay relevant and competitive in their careers by upgrading their skills and obtaining qualifications. Meanwhile, people from all walks of life adopt our platform to enrich their lives with our online skill or hobby courses, especially during academic resurgences with a number of safe social activities is limited. As we move forward, this course is attracting students from increasing wider age range. Thanks to our  flexible and responsive online learning platform as well as our course content covering work credentials to general interest. Sunlands can become the most preferred choice. As a result, new student enrollments for our professional certification skills programs in the first quarter grew by 1% year-over-year and 20.9% quarter-over-quarter, despite the intentional reduction of marketing activities, as I just mentioned. Gross billings for the sector also increased by 6.7% year-over-year. We believe the gross momentum moment in our professional certification skills programs will persist, giving our diverse course offerings and learners enduring in  for new challenges. We will continue to add new course content and provide customized course specific to various group's unique preference. With respect to our master's degree-oriented programs, we have seen increasingly intense competition, as more industry players join the segment, especially after China's implementation of new regulation banning after school tutoring for students in compulsory education. As a result of competition and the fewer marketing promotions as part of our balanced gross profitability strategy, new student enrollments and gross billings for our master's degree-oriented programs declined. Despite the short-term impact, we are confident that our well proven profitability strategy, highly capable teaching staff and optimized teaching and services will position us for long-term growth in the segment. As there is still enormous potential according to Intelligence Research, market size for master's in entrance exam preparation courses has reached RMB6.1 billion in 2021, representing a 28.1% year-over-year increase, and is expected to continue to grow. To conclude, we believe that the price  and quality of our courses, our effective teaching system and our experienced team advantages that will serve as catalysts for our future growth. Going forward, we will remain dedicated to empowering each of our students, individuals  faced by constantly evolving and enriching our product offerings to satisfy their needs, which we believe will benefit our long-term goals and contribute to China's core economic development against the micro headwinds. With that, I will turn the call to our CFO, Selena to run through our financials.
Selena Lu Lv: Thank you, Tongbo. Hello, everyone. We are excited to start year with encouraging first quarter results. Our net revenues reached RMB613.3 million during the quarter, above the top end of our guidance range despite an 11.7% year-over-year decrease. As we remain unwavering regarding many important sustainable growth instead of blind pursuit of scale expansion to meet the existing complex macro-economic environment. Meanwhile, we continue to manage our costs responsibly, thanks to which our operating expenses in the first quarters declined by 48.1% year-over-year. As a result, we suspend our profitability in this quarter with net profit margin reaching 29.3%, representing a substantial 37 percentage points increase year-over-year. Notably, we also maintained positive operating cash flow in the first quarter at RMB10.1 million.
