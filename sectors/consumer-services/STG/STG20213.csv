Our net revenues grew 9.9% year-over-year to RMB 595.1 million despite the evolving industry dynamics. We recorded net profit of RMB 93.8 million compared with net loss of RMB 165.8 million during the same period last year and a year-over-year 33.8% and 29.3% decline in new enrollments and gross billings, respectively, which are attributed to our continued efforts to execute our balanced long-term growth and profitability strategy. As COVID-19 pandemic resurgences in certain regions in China continue to create challenges for business operations and the broader economy recovery, tenants have taken steps to improve operating efficiency and reduce costs. With respect to talent acquisition, many companies have become more prudent in selecting talents and have reached their expectations for candidates and the new hires. This ultimately led to a more competitive labor market in the third quarter, prompting working professionals to seek enrichment courses back hours to increase their competitiveness through further education and rescaling and upscaling. Meanwhile, industry dynamics are also evolving rapidly with the increasing number of companies joining the end of education business after the implementation of China's K-12 after-school tutoring regulations. With this landscape, we continue to execute our balanced long-term growth and the profitability strategy and so to enhance our competitiveness by focusing on optimizing our product mix, improving services, reducing costs and enhancing students acquisition efficiency.

The breadth of our course offerings also appears to more people across a wider range of age groups, which could help further expand our student base. We believe that with our relentless endeavor to provide our students with a better learnings experience, we are well positioned to fulfill the certain demand for low interest-based learning, catering to endorse of all ages. We achieved a 20.8% year-over-year increase in net revenues in our master's degree-oriented programs, while new enrollments and gross billings decreased by 22.2% and 10.2% year-over-year, respectively, as we prioritized quality growth. However, we continue to expand our global footprint during the quarter by forming additional partnerships with overseas universities and made encouraging progresses. And at the same time, we continue to diversify our course portfolio for the segment looking to capture the huge growth opportunities in this market. Demand for exam preparation course sales remains strong, and we expect to further grow given the competitive employment market. Notably, a large number of our students are middle or senior level managers, strongly motivated to acquire more knowledge and sharpen their management skills through MBA and  degree education. Helping them to achieve their learning goals will continue to be a priority as we see solid growth momentum and potential in space. Turning now to our STE programs as we strove to optimize our product mix, gross billings and new enrollments for STE moderated, which was also partially due to the licensing regulation and advertisement things for continued education. We believe these regulations will help the industry achieve healthy and a sustainable growth and contribute to China's effort to build a lifeline society. We have implemented strict compliance standards and we'll continue to monitor and comply with relevant rules and regulations while providing quality courses to our students. In addition, we adopted stringent policies and attractive incentive plans to enhance our operations and services in the third quarter, with the goal of providing students a , more rewarding learning experience.
