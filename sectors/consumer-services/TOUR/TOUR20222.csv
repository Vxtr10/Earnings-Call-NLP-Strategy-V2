Donald Yu: Thank you, Mary. Good day, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. During the second quarter, while in April and May, tourism was impacted by most severe resurgence of COVID-19. Since the initial breakout in 2020. In June, we saw a rapid recovery as outbreaks were better controlled. The industry also benefited from variable policies, such as more relaxed travel restrictions. The enthusiasm for travel among the public remained high with demand increasing since the first half of the year. Tuniuâs total travel GMV growth exceeded 100% month-over-month during June and July, despite the setback in the second quarter. With the peak travel season starting in July booking volume for several popular destinations increased significantly with Tuniuâs booking volume doubling in July compared to the previous month. By keeping our focus on providing high quality products and services during times of external challenges, we are able to weather industry downturns and recover quickly during the rebound. In terms of our product new tool our core self-operated product continues to offer a high level of standard services to meet diverse customer demand. Since it was first launched over a decade ago, new tools production ecosystem has developed its own operating process and standards for product design, resource selection, customer service, and evaluation. Tuniuâs high quality products are the key to our high customer retention rate with the contribution of our repeat customers to overall GMV remaining at over 70%, since the pandemic broke out. Leveraging Tuniuâs high quality products and the reputation we aim to develop more popular products to meet the high market demand during the peak seasons. Taking one of our new tool products designed for Xinjiang as an example, we increased the number of the tour groups to meet the high demand in July with the sales of the product, exceeding RMB3 million in a single month. In terms of product innovation, during the second quarter, we continue to explore village tour products as customer demand continues to become more diversified. In addition to traditional tours the experiential tours have become more popular and help to provide opportunities for the high quality development of village tourism and boutique band beat. Tuniu also collaborates with the several village tourism projects on operation and management, in addition to their product development and promotion by leveraging our advantages and funds in the industrial chain. Tuniuâs self-operated B&B in changing has been experiencing increase in occupancy since it was opened the May last year with revenue growth of over 200% year-on-year in both June and July of this year. We will continue to explore rural tourism and B&B with an asset-light model in order to support the utilization and the development of the local tourism industry and enrich Tuniuâs product offerings for our guests. Live streaming shows are becoming more and more pretty balanced in customersâ daily life, and are now a key channel for Tuniuâs sales promotions and customer acquisitions. Tuniu features different types of live streaming shows focused on product sales and introduction of various destinations, as well as recommendations for destination-based activities and products such as the camping equipment. As a company we have deep experience in tourism. Tuniu has clear advantages in producing tourism-related live streaming shows. In April, we launched a live streaming show on Douyin and the show ranked at the top hotel and the travel live streaming show in Eastern China in May and June. With the total GMV of the live streaming show exceeding RMB8 million in June. As one of our core competencies Tuniu is committed to focusing on customer demand and providing high quality service. Despite the changes to the external environment. Under the current COVID-19 control measures Tuniu launched additional services including speed reforms up to 24 hours before departure day. And new click beta testing in some of our organizer tour products.

In terms of technology, we continue to improve efficiency and quality through digitalization, as we optimize our internal operations and external customer experience. For internal operations, we have further automated type our inventory management and product launching processes, as well as display and maintenance to reduce labor costs. In terms of enhancing customer experience, we are leveraging AI technology to replace some of the simple manual customer service tasks, such as the reception of guests on their first visit, as well as recommendations for products and live streaming shows, further reducing the burden on manual customer service and improving the response speed and for customer service request.

Other revenues were down 20% year-over-year to RMB 27.4 million and accounting for 74% in our total net revenues.

Please note that this forecast reflects Tuniu's current and preliminary view on the industry and its operations, which is subject to change, particularly as to the uncertainties brought back by the impact of COVID-19. Thank you for listening. We are now ready for your questions. Operator?
Operator:  The first question is from Su Wong , a Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you, operator. Hi management. As we can see the second quarter saw significant increasing loss. Could you specify the courses and in the context of the recent recovery of tourism industry how has your business recovered in recent month, especially during the summer vacation? Thank you.
Donald Yu: Thank you for the question. In the past quarter the travel industry has experienced the hardest time ever since the outbreak of COVID-19/2020. The resurgence our pandemic has prohibited many trips, especially zero travels. This greatly harmed our net revenues and revenues from packaged tours in particular for the second quarter. In terms of expenses, considering the continued influence of COVID-19 and uncertainty of the future market company did a goodwill impairment assessment and determined to record over RMB 100 million of goodwill impairment this quarter. Apart from this impairment, our non-GAAP operating system â our non-GAAP operating expenses decreased over 30% year-over-year. As summer vacation comes, the travel market is boosted by incentives such as relaxed restriction policies, increasing demand and peak season deferred from previous quarter; long-distance tours are preferred compared to local tours during summer vacation. According to our data, the average travel duration exceeded three days in July which were longer than those during spring festival and May Day holidays. Products for families with children are always popular during summer vacations. Apart from traditional theme parks and seaside trips, we launched the entertainment travel products, which promote children's participation and experience during the trips. Besides due to the hot weather this year, travelers had increased the demands for enjoying the cool and health-related services. In terms of destinations, Yunnan, Hainan and Xinjiang were Top 3 destinations in July. We showed a positive GMV growth compared to the same month last year. But Eastern China, which used to be one of the most popular departure and the definition district, was still on the way to recover due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the previous quarter. In August, there were outbreaks in some popular destinations, which brought negative impact on the travel industry in the short-term. However, since the travel restriction scope was further narrowed the two countries the pressure on travel market was more moderate than before. From our data we see definitions without severe pandemic outbreak was still growing. For example, the order amount from Guangdong Province remained increase in August compared to July. To ensure good customer experience and current circumstances will increase the flexibility of our travel products. Customers may book in advance and later confirm departure city â departure date in online, or get for refund upon cancellation. For certain products event so the trip is confirmed. Our customers can cancel it and get a full refund for local tour operator services up to 24 hours before their departure date. Despite the current resurgence of the pandemic, looking ahead with the implementation of the precise and differentiate aided strategies in the prevention and control of COVID-19 domestic trips will be smoother and the industry will continue to recover. Thank you
