Thank you for listening. We are now ready for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you.  We can now take the first question from Tina Bide  who is a Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. This is Tina Bide speaking of  Hi, management. Congratulations on the strong recovery of the second quarter. Would you please share with us your core destinations? And my second question is regarding the recent coronavirus outbreak in several cities across China, how does it impact your performance in the third quarter? And what is your view towards the mid to long-term development of the travel industry? Thank you.
Donald Yu: Thank you for the question. In the second quarter, the external environment was very positive for the recovery of travel industry. In fact, we report the sales strengthening ever since the resumption of inter-province travel in last July. We've adapted the four life cycle customer management method to gain and retain customers. Also, our tour advisers in more training such as on destination knowledge and customized services to add to - enhance their serviceability, part from traditional online channels will also provide our sales staff with new channels such as Taiko app, our social media and live streaming show. As a result, our revenues, especially the revenues from packaged tours grew largely during the quarter. In terms of the packaged tour GMV, our best destination for the culture  was Hainan, one of the most popular leisure travel destinations in China, followed by Shanghai and Guandong  both of which have famous theme parks and good for families with children. And then were Guangzhou and Sichuan   boosted by short holidays during the quarter. Other destinations included the popular site in  Yunnan and Xinjiang. For the second question, yes, the recent COVID-19 outbreaks in several cities across China had negative impact on the travel industry during the peak season. In fact, the travel market showed rapid growth due to the summer vacation before the outbreak in late July. Our tour generally in July increased both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. However, considering the safety issue some provinces have ceased inter-province travel since mid-July. Therefore, we expect the net revenue for the third quarter to align with the same period last year or decrease up to 10% year-over-year. After the outbreak of virus in July, our first priority is to ensure the safety and the interest of our customers, having been done refund and reschedule their trips. We also upgraded our destination service, including customers with new, clean of ATG  testing. Our employees, both in the headquarter and at destinations worked in shifts around the clock to help our customers with any emergencies and try to send them on earlier and safer. For products, we launched the products without a fixed departure date, which means the customer may book the itinerary now enjoying the current favorable price and departing in two or three months time when the external environment gets better or they have a vaccine. The customer only needs to make second confirmation about the exact departure date in advance, then we will arrange their trips accordingly. They can also cancel orders at any time with a full refund, if they change their trip plan. The economical and flexible product is welcomed by all customers, especially the younger generation. In general, we are still positive about the industry, for the demand its always there, despite the short term recession during this January and February, we experienced record rebound since March. With the pandemic being under control, the market will get better and better. Thank you.
