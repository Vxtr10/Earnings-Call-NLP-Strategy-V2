Thank you for listening. We are now ready for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  The first question today comes from  with Retail. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Hello, my name is Grace. I have a question for management. As we know, the tourism industry is currently pleased with challenges because of the severe resurgence of COVID-19 in the past few months. And on the first circumstances, how do you view the future development of the tourism industry and what strategic measures will the company take in the second half of the year to deal with the risks for pandemic. Will there be any changes compared to the past? Thank you.
Donald Dunde Yu: Thank you for the question. We are facing the most severe rebound of the pandemic since the first quarter of 2020. The current  has negatively affected the domestic travel market, as well as our revenues in the first half of the year. However, we are glad to see that with the number of infections gradually going down recently, domestic travel restrictions tend to be eased. In the past  our number of reps doubled compared with spring festival. The market may remain the momentum of recovery in the coming summer location and national day holiday provided the pandemic phase under control. In the long month, we believe the industry will continue to grow despite the impact of the pandemic, tourism demand has not decreased but has been temporarily pent-up. And it will eventually be releasing something. This demonstrated by the increasing popular retail campaign since the spring. To capture the pent-up demand and the reset uncertainties of the pandemic we insist to provide products, which are innovative and flexible. On one side, we -- our product design follows the concept of parental tourism adding more personalized interactive activities for people to enjoy the avenues during the feed. On the other side, our product sales adopts advanced booking and travel congestion model. People are free to book any products at any time if their trips are delayed or canceled or they can choose later departure date or just get a refund. In terms of service, so we always insist with the customer first principle and provide full cycle service to our customers. Group services help us to retain customers. It's important to care about customers, especially when the market is fresh. Our customer service returned to close contact with regular customer during the pandemic to reinforce the customer stickiness providing them with travel related messages. Therefore, Tuniu is likely to be their first of choice when our customers plan to travel. In addition, the pandemic brings changes to the travel industry, and we are also trying something new. For example, we further developed rural tourism because it captures both the concept tourism and the momentum of local tour. Our local team travelled across the country to find fit for destinations, which should include a characteristic commendation for as well as local activities. We deeply cooperate with big technicians and design special products for them. Based on our experience in the travel industry and the knowledge of our customers, we have this definition to attract more customers and develop local tourism economy. More, we also run  by ourselves, a strong new business scope. In general, we will stay with Tuniu's core competitiveness under the challenging environment while trying to find the potential growth post. Thank you.
Operator:  And there appears to be no further questions. I will now turn the conference over to Tuniu's Director of Investor Relations, Mary, for any closing remarks.
