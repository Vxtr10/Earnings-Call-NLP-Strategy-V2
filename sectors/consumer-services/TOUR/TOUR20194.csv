Donald Yu: Thank you, Mary. Good day, everyone. Welcome to our 2019 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Looking back to 2019, it was a year marked by external events and that negatively impacted a number of short-haul destinations such as Hong Kong and long-haul destinations such as the United States, the decline in these destinations counteractive growth in destinations, such as Australia and New Zealand, resulting in a flat year-over-year growth in net revenues in 2019.At the start of 2020, we were seeing strong growth across most destinations. From the beginning of 2020 to the beginning of the Chinese New Year, Tuniu achieved 20% growth year-over-year in terms of overall GMV and 40% growth in terms of packaged tour GMV. Despite a strong start to 2020 the outbreak of the COVID-19 during Chinese New Year has since then significantly impacted our business. I will first give a brief update on the status of the company following the outbreak of COVID-19.As most people are aware, the 2020 Chinese New Year has been a challenging period for the travel industry and the Tuniu. Consumer industries across China have taken a major hit following the social distancing restrictions that were placed in order to reduce the spread of the virus. The leisure travel industry took the hardest hit of them all, as travel restrictions were implemented across China to contain the spread. In early 2020, China’s travel industry’s regulator prohibited the sale of various packaged tour products. Tuniu terminated the selling of most of packaged tour products and refunded or altered previously purchased packages with travel dates following the outbreak. Given the rapidly changing development, we will continue to closely monitor the situation and adjust accordingly.From a historical perspective, outbreaks that are masked with fast and attractive countermeasures only result in a temporary shock to the industry. Despite the short-term restrictions, we believe Chinese consumers demand for travel continues to grow. The current restrictions on travel will further build up travel demand in addition to the natural increases. We are positive on the long-term outlook of China’s travel industry. Once COVID-19 is contained, we believe travel will be one of the fastest recovering industries. Where there is a challenge there is also an opportunity. We have revised our core strategies in service, products and that impact from COVID-19 as well as to capture the potential opportunities. I will now go over the strategies in greater detail.First, I would like to talk about service which is the most important part during this special time for both our customers and our partners we displayed industry-leading service capabilities. In order to guarantee our customer experience, we refunded or altered all travel products affected by the COVID-19 and assisted traveling customers with return logistics. Following the initial outbreak there was a surge in customer inquiries with core volume increasing tenfold during the period Tuniu’s professional and dedicated customer service representatives works tirelessly to reassure customers and to help them modify their trips.Niu Tour implemented additional safety measures across the board in order to guarantee the safety of our customers Tuniu’s tour guides were given special training on increasing healthy awareness requiring them accommodations transportation and dining Tuniu’s 34 local tour operators across China are implemented additional safety precautions as the outbreak in order to protect our customers in 2019 Tuniu continued implementing its S2B2C strategy diversifying a sales channel through B2B distribution and social marketing. We achieved strong results during the year, as GMV of Difeng Cloud increased over 40% year over year during the fourth quarter of 2019.Next, I would like to talk about our products, our years of relationships with other parties in the supply chain and the previous allotment in the development of our own supply chain while crucial to help us minimize our losses during the outbreak. Innovative new forms of our products such as Tuniu's dynamic packaging system, self-operated local tour operators and destination-based tours are all more flexible than traditional products and are more closely integrated with our systems. These products were more easily booked and altered according to the needs of our customers, allowing for higher efficiency during the outbreak when changes were frequently made. Niu Tour and our local tour operators remained committed to their focus on quality because Tuniu’s is fully control of the quality of these products we were able to quickly adapt to these products to markets condition.And lastly I would like to briefly mention our systems. Our dynamic packaging system and various automation procedures were crucial in helping customers make changes during the outbreak. Returning to January 21 and February 2, our systems made over 500,000 itinerary changes a volume that is hard to process without the assistance of our systems going forward we will continue to invest in core systems and processes in order to further enhance our supply chain and efficiency. We will separate our development into three centralized systems warehouse assembly. And processing the warehouse system, we have consolidated all resources available to two new centralized systems that directly connects to internal and external inventories, the assembling system we have products professionals, the tools to utilize the products from the warehouse system to assemble new products. The processing system is the controller managing the automation process. Combined this framework of system design will advance our dynamic packaging capabilities, increase our efficiency and provide better experiences for our customers.We have also been directly promoting our social marketing tool as it is effective way of reaching our customers during social distancing. Our customer service representatives actively engage with both existing and new customers through this tool in order to prepare for recovery in demand. In the future, our social marketing tour will be fundamental path of our S2B2C system, helping Tuniu reach more customers with increased efficiency.During COVID-19 outbreak, we have utilized this opportunity to increase technical training for our colleagues through various online courses. Colleagues are encouraged to take additional courses on customer service, sales, marketing and various technical skills during this period. We want our quality to be well rested and better trained for the upcoming opportunities once the outbreak is contained. We will focus on improving Tuniu as a company so we can provide better products and services to our customers. We believe the impact of COVID-19 on the domestic travel will be short-term as China situation is largely contained. We are already seeing a slightly recovery in demand of local tours or short-haul domestic tours. To capture these opportunities, we have been promoting various domestic hotels, local attraction tickets and low-tape products for our customers. Our local tour operators across China are also preparing themselves for an increase in demand for domestic products and will be crucial for directly accessing local resources.Despite the positive trend for domestic tours, international travel will continue to be limited as various destination countries are restricting travel to control the spread of the COVID-19. As a result, we expect our net revenues to decline significantly during the first quarter of 2020. Because of this decline, we will scale back our expenses and optimize our cash flow in order to maintain a healthy level of cash. The COVID-19 is a challenge for both the travel industry and Tuniu. However, we believe Tuniu’s position within the travel industry and our active response to the current scenario will allow us to better capture future market opportunities once the travel industry recovers domestically and internationally.I will now turn the call over to Maria Xin, our CFO for the financial highlights.

The current circumstances and dynamics and the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations cannot be reasonably estimate at this time. And we anticipate this may have material adverse impact on our business. The initial positions results from operations and cash flow in 2020 as a result [Technical Difficulty] quarter of 2020, the company expect to generated RMB114.2 million to RMB159.9 million of net revenue which represent 65% to 75% decrease year-over-year.

We are now ready for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Aline Ha, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Aline Ha: Hi, management. My question is how big is the impact of the COVID-19 on both the company and our industry and also are you seeing a sense of a recovery at this moment? Thank you.
Donald Yu: Thank you. The COVID-19 initially broke out during the Chinese New Year. So it was a really tough period. As expected, the impact from the COVID-19 will be significant – will bear a significant impact on our first quarter results. But going forward and looking forward, we are seeing gradual increase in demand in terms of – for products, domestic products and local products. We are seeing rising demand for domestic hotels, local traction ticketing, road trips products. We believe this is a gradual trend for the recovery for the domestic market. However, the long-haul domestic market is still currently not available. So we are mostly promoting hotels of attracting ticketing packages for local or domestic destinations.International destinations and countries is of a different story. A lot of other international countries are still battling the coronavirus. So we will closely monitor the scenario internationally and act accordingly.In the last 3 to 4 years, we have developed a network of local tour operators operated by Tuniu throughout China. This will be key to capturing the increasing demand for rising demand for domestic tours both short-haul and for long-haul. Given that we are one of the largest or the largest tour operator networks, we have economy of scale. Our local tour operator network is very high quality. As such, we are able to work with number of travel – other travel companies to create or high-quality packages for customers throughout China. Also with the recovering of the domestic market, social marketing tool is one of the most important way for us to reach our customers. We have invested in the social marketing tool for the past 1.5 years. And we have developed numerous features on it. Using these tools, we are able to reach our customers and engage with them even during the outbreak of the coronavirus.Another one of our key focuses during this period is the controlling of our expenses. During this period, because of the drop-off in the revenues, we are trying to reduce our everyday expenses, some of which includes using rotational program for our colleagues to work. Others include the lowering of the management’s salaries to 40% of their previous level. So the whole company is gathering momentum to act in this very special time and we believe we could get through that. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, we are not showing any additional questions. We are now approaching the end of the conference call. I will now turn the call over to Tuniu’s CFO, Maria Xin for any closing remarks.
Maria Xin: Once again, thank you for joining us today. Please don’t hesitate to contact us for further questions. Thank you for your continued support and we look forward to speaking with you in the coming months. Thank you.
