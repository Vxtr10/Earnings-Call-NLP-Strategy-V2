Larry Chen: Thank you, Sherry. Good evening, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our 2022 first quarter earnings conference call on this special day, which happened to be Gaotu's third year listing anniversary. Before I start, I would like to remind everyone that all financial information that I mention later is based on RMB unless otherwise noted. In the first quarter of 2022, our business continued to maintain a healthy and sustainable development and we can remain profitable for two consecutive quarters since we began our business restructuring. In this quarter, our net revenues were RMB724.6 million, and our gross billings were RMB318.1 million to present the basis of comparison. If we only look at our comparable businesses, which are professional education for college students and adult, vocational education, STEAM education and digital educational products. The net revenues of our comparable business sales increased over 200% year-over-year and their gross billings increased approximately 42% year-over-year. Moreover, gross billings of comparable businesses have shown quarter-over-quarter growth for three consecutive quarters. Our gross margin this quarter was 70.6% slightly higher than that of the same period of last year. Our net income and non-GAAP net income were RMB53.7 million and RMB92.5 million, respectively, indicating that we have achieved effective growth. Furthermore, our capital positive -- our capital position remains strong. As of March 31, 2025 -- and '22, we had a total of approximately RMB3.2 million -- sorry, RMB3.2 billion in terms of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. Since we initiated our business restructuring and organizational adjustments in the third quarter of last year, our operations have been centered upon three key effects, focusing on the core businesses, enhancing product quality and improving operational efficiency. I will now briefly talk about our progress during the quarter on each of these three points. First, in terms of focusing on our core businesses, we will continue to concentrate on online education, and we will continue to develop and invest in our four core businesses, which are professional education for college students and adults, vocational education, STEAM education and digital educational products. During this quarter, the skill of our professional and vocational education services further increased compared with that of the last quarter. Net revenues realized approximately 82% quarter-over-quarter growth and its gross billings secured approximately 85% quarter-over-quarter growth. Our STEAM education service has also made solid progress, especially in program in tutoring businesses which grew over 10x year-over-year in terms of gross billings. Through the gradual development of our new businesses, we will continue to expand our product portfolio across various categories. We will also expand our advantages in the high school tutoring services to other businesses continue to offer 15 students upgraded and modified courses that satisfy related government policies, fulfill the diverse and multidimensional learning demand of students and to build a true  and service platform. Second, in terms of enhancing our product quality, we believe that now is the best time to accumulate know-how, service our regional aspiration to educate and return to the fundamental essence of education. We remain rigid on our principle that quality is the core of education. As such, we will continue to uphold our pursuit of delivering exceptional education quality. We will continue to invest in teaching the store sales offer the best education content and products, and we will continue to invest in technology to provide more user-friendly and personalized products. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain our standard of hiring the best instructors in the industry and offering very competitive packages. In the quarter, research and development expenses accounted for 17% of our total revenue, returning to a relatively high proportion as reflecting our emphasis on the importance of R&D and online education. Because our new businesses are still in their early development stage, adequate R&D investment is essential, but we will gradually reduce and strictly control our R&D and other operating costs to be within a specific range as we execute our strategy of effective growth and constantly evaluate the development of our business. At the same time, we have sufficient cash reserves to support our investment in R&D. Going forward, we will uphold our principles of good teachers are fundamental and our corporate value of the customer first, continuously refine our product quality based on a long-term view and strive to provide the best educational services in the industry to students, and that creates the most value for our customers. By firmly focused on customer value proposition and the firmly investing in the capabilities to deliver value, we believe we will generate sustainable and high-quality revenue growth. Third, in terms of improving our operational efficiency, we continue to revamp our on-site operations and management to strengthen organizational and operational efficiency. After a profitable last quarter, we continue to profit with 12.8% non-GAAP and income margin in this quarter, indicating that we have achieved healthy and sustainable growth. Our sales and marketing costs also significantly decreased. As end margin this quarter decreased 79 percentage points compared with that of the same period of last year, while the SM efficiency has notably improved. This is solid proof that our multi-channel customer acquisition method is highly effective even in this changing external environment. To further improve efficiency, we will continue to work towards optimizing our business processes and resources education to enhance productivity. We have never once changed our confidence in China's massive education market and our determination on delivering the highest quality education to students. China's economic development has brought about performed transformation and upgrade in various industries, which have created a demand for new skill sets and thus presented more opportunities and possibilities. We will closely monitor and follow the ongoing trends in the Chinese labor market, continue to cultivate the education industry while guided by the field and the training needs required by the country's future. Activity showed our social responsibility as an education company and utilize technology to deliver high-quality education thereby delivering real value and promoting the long-term growth of the Chinese education industry. Through the ups and down, we will be celebrating Gaotu's Eighth anniversary next week. It might be easy to do a business for one year or maybe even three years, but it's hard to run the companies that have sustained for over 10 years and only a selected few companies can become long lasting organization. Success belongs to the optimistic feel who dare to transform, who are eager to innovate, who have faced and who persevered through opportunities regardless of how the strong environment change. We will stay tuned to our original aspiration to education and our love to education. We firmly believe that as long as we slow down and process while accumulating ticket variances and activities, we will be able to create a world of our own in the field of education. Lastly, we would like to take this opportunity to deeply thank all medical staff for their dedication and hard work in the past days, mainly overcomes the pandemic and all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much. Now I will pass this call over to our CFO, Shannon, and walk you through our financial and operational details.

As most of our new businesses are still in the earliest , we will compare our financial performance on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Alongside with year-over-year comparisons to better present the development of our new strategic businesses. Our focus this year remains on core businesses. Professional education for college students and adults, vocational education, STEAM education and digital education products. On April 20, 2022, China's top legislature passed the mandate vocational education law of the People's Republic of China as the 34 section of the 13th National People's Congress. The law has taken effect in May 1, 2022. It has confirmed for the first time that vocational education is of equal importance as general education, and it advocates for a high republic acceptance of vocational education. We believe that under the strong support of government policy, vocational education will have a better future with higher market demand.

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Today's first question comes from Mark Li with Citi. Please go ahead.
Mark Li: Hi, management. Thank you for this presentation. This is Mark Li from Citi. May I ask a question on your Q2 guidance. I noticed your Q2 guidance of RMB438 million to RMB468 million revenue. May I know a rough breakdown for the revenue, especially for the four core segments that we may sustain going forward? Thank you.
Shannon Shen: Thanks, Mark. So regarding the second quarter guidance, we haven't provided the details and break down that into the four core session. And as everyone has been noticed that on our earnings release, we have combined other business, and we didn't kind of like separate them into like the four different segments. And because majority of our new businesses are still at early stage, and we want the business to become more stable before we can provide a process guidance and separate them into different segments. So right now, we will recommend you to look at the company as a whole and see how the revenue is trending.
Mark Li: Got it. May I follow-up quickly, if could you just maybe comment on the momentum for these four segments, let's say, into the Q2. Any qualitative comment could be helpful?
Shannon Shen: Yes. So this is kind of like our second quarter after the transformation of our new business, and we are still making gratifying progresses. Although we have higher expectations of ourselves. And as I mentioned earlier, the revenue of our new businesses, if we make an apple-to-apple comparison, has exceeded 200% growth, both on a year-over-year basis and a quarter-over-quarter basis. And also the gross billing has increased by more than 60% year-over-year, laying the foundation for our future development. While maintaining the high growth, we have also managed to profit retain a non-GAAP margin of 12.8%, that proves that we have the ability to balance the rapid growth and profitability. So in terms of various of categories, like our team education of finance-related examination training or division examination training and like the preparations we provide for post-graduate college entrance exams. These have all achieved considerable growth from previous quarter end. We also foresee these sectors to grow over high double-digit percent on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And we believe these businesses will continue to become our growth engines in the future, Mark.
Mark Li: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Shannon Shen: Thanks.
