I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. Balan Nair.
Balan Nair: Thank you, Mike. And welcome everybody to Liberty Latin America's results presentations for the second quarter and first half of 2021. I'll begin by taking you through our Group highlights and operating results before handing over to Chris Noyes, our CFO, who will follow with a review of the company's financial performance. After that, we will get straight to your questions. As always, I'm joined by my Executive Team from across the region. And I'll get them involved as needed during the Q&A following our prepared remarks. As a point of housekeeping, we will both be working from slides, which you can find on our website at www.lla.com. Starting on Slide 4 in our highlights. We delivered a strong set of results in the second quarter as our markets continue to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. RGU adds of 73,000 represented continued momentum following a record Quarter 1 performance. Cable & Wireless Caribbean & Networks and Puerto Rico once again drove the Group with strong commercial execution. In Mobile, we had our best ever quarter, adding 118,000 new subscribers. This was done by Panama, which very nearly replicated a record Q1 performance, and in Jamaica, where adds are 55,000 which was 45,000 higher than the first quarter. Our continued operational recovery which drove 8% rebased revenue growth, together with a disciplined focus on cost controls resulted in a robust rebased adjusted OIBDA growth of 10% in Q2. Liberty Puerto Rico had another strong quarter, up 21% on a rebased basis, while C&W Caribbean & Networks and CNW Panama also delivered double-digit rebased growth compared to Q2 2020, which was a quarter that was most impacted by COVID-19. We also grew sequentially from Q1, which shows our resiliency and focus. New build and upgrade plans are a core element of our growth strategy and following our most like active first half ever with approximately 360,000 new homes passed or upgraded. I'm pleased to announce that we are increasing our 2021 target to now deliver over 700,000 new or upgraded homes, more than 95% of which are fiber-to-the-home. Finally, we announced earlier this week that we have received the required authorizations to complete the acquisition of Telefonica's Costa Rican operations. We expect this transaction to close very shortly. Moving to Slide 4, and highlights for key markets. Note that we've provided relative revenue contributions for each market through the percentages shown. Starting with Puerto Rico, our largest single market which contributed nearly a third of the Group's $1.2 billion in revenue in the second quarter, all of which is US dollar revenue. We continue to see strong growth in our Puerto Rico operations as broadband penetration increases, and we continue to deliver healthy adds. In terms of the integration of Liberty Mobile, this is progressing well and remains an exciting driver of future free cash flow growth as we look to generate significant synergies from the in-market combination. Moving to Chile, which represents 18% of LLA revenue in Q2. We are progressing here by stabilizing the subscriber base, and now look to build on this platform by selling into our growing high speed footprint. Given the challenging competitive environment, we are also very focused on managing costs and are seeing some savings from actions we have taken, and we are matching our competitor's pricing. We would rather give our consumers to savings than to concede any subscribers to our competitors. Lastly, while we're seeing some easing of mobility restrictions, curfews and international travel restrictions still remain. Next to Costa Rica, where, as I mentioned, we will close our acquisition of Telefonica's business very shortly. This will create an innovative, converged scale play in the market and drive good synergies through in-market consolidation. As with many of our markets, some degree of mobility restrictions are still in place. However, Cabletica has consistently performed right through true the past 18 months driven by growing in-home broadband demand. Turning to the bottom row and Panama, which contributed 11% of Group's revenue in Q2. Here we saw our Mobile momentum continue in Q2, with subscribers' additions driven by the Todo Todito plan. Panama is one of the most severely impacted markets by COVID-19. However, mobility restrictions have eased, and the ability of vaccines is expected to increase. Next Jamaica, which is the largest C&W Caribbean & Networks market and represented 9% of LLA revenue in the second quarter. Here, we have seen some very good operating and financial results despite relatively low vaccination rates. In the last 12 months, Jamaica has added 95,000 RGUs and 111,000 mobile subscribers, which is a testament to the hard work of our team. And the consumer acceptance of the new propositions we have launched. Moving to Networks, which contributed 7% of LLA's Q2 revenue. As we've mentioned in recent quarters, this is a high margin and mainly US dollar business that has also benefited from increased bandwidth demand across broadband and video applications in the region. Lastly, what we've categorized as Other Markets, representing the Rest of C&W Caribbean & Networks and contributing just under a quarter of Q2 revenues for LLA. Growth for these markets are expected through higher data penetration in usage in both our fixed and mobile products. In terms of the broader backdrop, tourism is an important economic driver for these markets, and an increased number of visitors is anticipated in the second half of the year, further helping recovery. Of the markets in this Grouping and LLA overall, Trinidad is currently the most negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Turning to Slide 6, and our operating performance. Starting with fixed subscriber additions, where the Group had another strong quarter, bringing first half net adds to just under 150,000 RGUs or nearly double the prior year period. Taking each reporting segment in turn, C&W Caribbean and Networks shown in the upper left, reported higher net adds year-over-year in the second quarter, with the largest contribution coming from Jamaica, where we added 26,000 RGUs. The Bahamas and Barbados represented a majority of the remaining adds. In Panama, we added 9,000 RGUs in the quarter, with footprint expansion and product improvements that drive further growth through the year. ARPU is impacted by retention activities such as the use of lifeline plans, discounts and moving customers to lower cost plans. Liberty Puerto Rico in the upper center continue to increase broadband penetration and grew its subscriber base by 22,000 in the quarter. The prior year benefited from higher demand as customers adapted to working and learning from home. In Chile, we are stabilizing our subscriber base following RGU losses in the second half of 2020. The market remains very competitive, and we continue to focus on customer retention as mentioned on the previous slide. Our last segment, Costa Rica shown in the upper right, had another good quarter with net adds of 11,000 and robust ARPU development. As a Group, we delivered strong Q2 adds of 73,000 RGUs with year-over-year improvements driven by C&W Panama and C&W Caribbean & Networks. Our Group ARPU per customer at $50 was up 3% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. Moving to Slide 7, and a record Mobile performance. Starting again with C&W Caribbean & Networks in the upper left, where we added 58,000 subscribers in the quarter, a swing of 234,000 subscribers as compared to Q2 2020. Jamaica added most of the segment subscribers in the quarter up by 55,000. Then into Panama, which again generated the most adds in the quarter, growing its base by 60,000 net subs. As mentioned, this was driven by our unlimited data Todo Todito plan. Liberty Mobile grew its subscriber base modestly in the quarter. Of note, we saw improved growth in postpaid where we added 11,000 subscribers. Finally, VTR lost 7,000 Mobile subscribers in the quarter. We operate as an MVNO in Chile, predominantly providing postpaid services to existing fixed service subscribers, and a small player in the market. In aggregate as a Group, we added a record 118,000 Mobile subscribers in the quarter with a blended ARPU of $19. The increase of 68% year-over-year is driven by the inclusion of Liberty Mobile in Q2 2021. Next to Slide 8 and our B2B operations. Starting with a total Group performance on the left side. We delivered robust rebased growth of 5% in the quarter, as markets continue to recover steadily from the impacts of COVID-19. In the center, we break out the performance for C&W Caribbean & Networks and C&W Panama. These segments include the majority of our B2B operations, representing approximately 80% of total B2B revenue. The upper graph shows stable year-over-year performance across our Subsea business, and LATAM B2B markets, where we have TACA competitive positions. Our incumbent, Caribbean and Panamanian B2B operations have faced greater challenges over the past year, primarily due to reduce tourism and the associated impacts on local economies where we operate. Due to the revenue reduction, there has been more scope to cover these operations. However, we are yet to reach pre-COVID levels. On the right of this Slide, we wanted to provide a brief update on our B2B customer segments. First, our enterprise segments, which represents approximately 40% of our B2B revenue is recovering well, driven by improved economic - visibility and business confidence in our markets. This segment benefits from the shift to remote working and associated solutions. Second, wholesale, which is mainly comprised of Networks and C&W and represents about a quarter of B2B revenue overall. As bandwidth demands grow, this drives our wholesale business. Third, small and medium businesses or SMB contributed about 15% to B2B overall. Digital innovation during pandemic has provided a growth driver for this segment. Fourth, government projects and services, which also represented approximately 15% of B2B revenue. This is particularly significant customer segment in Panama, where several new projects have come to the market is associated with a drive to digitalize processes, record keeping and other related infrastructure. And lastly, hospitality, which represents less than 5% of B2B revenue. This has been the most directly impacted customer group by reduced tourist arrivals. It will also be the most positively levered to any increase in visitors. However, it's worth noting that it represents a small amount of B2B overall. Next to Slide 9, and an overview of our Infrastructure Assets. Starting with our new build and upgrade activity on the left side. Here you can see the significant ramp in build year-over-year and the technology evolution where virtually all our new build and upgrade activity is now via fiber-to-the-home. This provides both fast speeds and greater operating efficiency, with lower energy costs required to run the network. In the center of the Slide, we thought it would be helpful to provide a snapshot of homes passed by technology and mobile networks across our markets. The key takeaway from a fixed network perspective are that just under 90% of our footprint is either HFC or FTTH. And the FTTH element is growing up 4 percentage points as a proportion of our overall Networks year-to-date. In Mobile, we have a minimum of LTE across all our largest markets and Telefonica's operations in Costa Rica are also LTE. Puerto Rico is our first 5G market and our experience there will stand us in good stead when the time comes across all of our other markets. Finally, on the right side of the Slide, we wanted to highlight our Subsea business footprint and some of its key attributes. Firstly, we have a Unique Mesh Network with four trunk submarine cable systems. This extensive network differentiates our ability to provide more resilient solutions and improve our economics. Secondly, we have significant room to grow with relatively low capital investment, as we currently utilize only approximately 10% of our potential capacity across our networks. And lastly, at over 50,000 kilometers of cable, our network is the most extensive in the region with over 90% of our traffic going from the Caribbean and Central America to the US. Growth in demand for this connectivity is expected to continue. Finally, to Slide 10, and a strategic update within the framework that we initially presented in February. Starting with the first pillar of recovery and growth. As covered earlier, effective operational execution led to strong subscriber growth in the first half, combined with a disciplined focus on cost management, this operational improvement has driven key financial metrics and most importantly of all, adjusted free cash flow growth. Looking ahead, we committed to maintaining this momentum and to build on the operational stabilization achieved at VTR. Second, to our commercial pillar. As I've covered, operational execution overall has been strong on the first half of the year with consumer propositions resonating well. This is an ongoing challenge and there are always areas where we can improve, but results and momentum are positive. Digital has also been a key focus of ours, but looking further ahead as we navigate the pandemic. As we look forward, our converged offerings are gaining traction as we introduce innovative bundles that are unique to our quad play network. But we're still in the early innings here. So we have more scope to grow, particularly as we combine fixed and mobile operations in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. We are also looking to increase self-installs across our markets. And this makes for a much better customer experience as well as reduced capital spending. Third, our Network. In addition to our exciting new build and upgrade activity, I also wanted to highlight our successful application for FCC funding via Uniendo in Puerto Rico. We were granted $71.5 million to deploy and upgrade networks covering more than 900,000 locations in 43 out of 78 municipalities across Puerto Rico. This represents the majority of funds that were available to this one. We plan to continue investing in our networks and as mentioned, have raised our fixed target to over 700,000 new upgraded homes in 2021. Cost focus is our fourth pillar, our Panama operations that is now fully established. This is enabling savings to our existing Group and will help drive synergies as we acquire businesses in the future and streamline our internal operations. Disciplined management of our costs has helped OIBDA margins improve, notably in C&W Caribbean & Networks. This pillar will be an area of ongoing focus and opportunity as we drive towards a more centralized operations. There may be some near-term volatility related to acquisition-related integration costs, but this will be accompanied by significant synergy benefits from such combinations. Lastly, to capital allocation. This is a key competency of our Group and a driver for additional shareholder returns. In-market consolidation opportunities at fair value, such as that of Liberty Mobile and soon to close acquisition of Telefonica's Costa Rican operations are good examples of the potential we see in the region. If we see an accretive opportunity in our own public market valuation that is also something we will look to take advantage of. And in the last quarter, we resumed our buyback activity. Going forward, we are excited about the synergies we can drive from announced transactions and the potential for similarly accretive deals in the region. Our approach to capital allocation will remain consistent and disciplined. With that, I'll pass you over to Chris Noyes, our Chief Financial Officer will talk you through our financial performance before we take your questions. Chris?
Chris Noyes: Thanks, Balan. Starting on Slide 12. We reported revenue of $1.17 billion in Q2 or 8% rebased growth over the prior year. In terms of products, we achieved rebased growth across the Board with our largest gains in Mobile and B2B, both of which were the most severely impacted by COVID-19 in the prior year quarter. Taking our revenue performance combined with our focus on cost control, we were able to post adjusted OIBDA of $464 million or 10% rebased growth. P&E additions stepped up from last year's levels to $215 million in Q2 or 18% of revenue, partly reflecting the addition of Liberty Mobile, as well as higher CPE spend. Our year-to-date CapEx was 16% of revenue. We expect our spend to increase in H2, as we look to further our Liberty Mobile integration and pursue our aggressive network expansion, upgrade and capacity plans. In terms of FCF, we reported $35 million of adjusted free cash flow for Q2, bringing our year-to-date total to $93 million or 15% higher than H1 2020. Relative to last year's Q2, the decrease was primarily due to much higher cash CapEx of about $75 million in the quarter. We remain well on track to deliver our full year target of approximately $200 million in adjusted free cash flow and we would expect substantially all the remaining FCF in H2 to be generated in our seasonally strong fourth quarter. Turning to the next Slide, I will dive into our Q2 segment performance and for reference, we have included the adjusted OIBDA comparison to last year and to Q1 in the bottom half of the slide. Starting on the left, with C&W Caribbean & Networks. We delivered $434 million of revenue and $188 million of adjusted OIBDA, reflecting rebased growth of 8% and 14%, respectively. Notably, our financial results also expanded from Q1. Our rebased revenue performance in Q2 was driven by growth across all our products. As Balan previously noted, we have seen strong RGU growth, particularly in Jamaica, and this has been the driver of fixed revenue progression. In mobile, revenue has grown through higher ARPU as mobility restrictions have become less severe, and usage has increased. And in B2B, we are benefiting from the positive effects of modestly improving economic activity. Managing our cost base was crucial to robust cash generation in a challenging 2020. And we have been focused on being thoughtful around spend as revenue recovers. This has helped to drive significant OIBDA margin improvement as Q2 margin reached 43%. P&E additions expanded to $73 million or 17% of revenue, as we supported our quarterly subscriber growth and invested in a combination of projects, including those related to capacity, new build and products. Turning to Cable & Wireless Panama. CWP's Q2 revenue of $128 million and adjusted OIBDA of $46 million were 15% and 24% higher on a rebased basis, respectively, our strongest result of any segment in the quarter. Compared to the prior year, revenue growth was driven by strong B2B performance, including the return of government-related projects that have been put on hold and higher mobile usage from improved economic activity. Our residential mobile business also reported double-digit rebased growth as our subscriber base increased by over 200,000 in the past 12 months. The momentum underlying our business can be seen sequentially to Q1 as revenue adjusted OIBDA increased by $6 million and $2 million, respectively. Capital spending grew in the quarter to $20 million or 16% of revenue. Our construction crews delivered 39,000 homes, bringing our year-to-date total to 60,000 new and/or upgraded homes. Liberty Puerto Rico is highlighted in the middle of the slide. Growth continues with the business generating top line rebased growth of 11% and adjusted OIBDA rebased growth of 21%, bringing revenue and adjusted OIBDA to $360 million and $161 million, respectively. Rebased revenue growth was driven by double-digit growth in our legacy fixed operations, which resulted primarily from the 124,000 RGUs we have added over the last 12 months. Additionally, the recently acquired Liberty Mobile business delivered rebased revenue growth of approximately 7%. On the costs side, we are in the early days of integrating and synergizing the Liberty Mobile asset. Notably, Q2 integration OpEx was only $2 million. P&E additions were $51 million or 14% of revenue. And we expect capital spend to accelerate in H2 with integration and ramping new build activity in part related to the Uniendo funding that Balan highlighted. Switching to VTR, our year-over-year rebased declines remain elevated as we have discussed on prior calls. Q2 revenue of $209 million and adjusted OIBDA of $69 million reflect rebased declines of 6% and 18%, respectively. These declining growth rates have modestly improved as compared to Q1. Our challenged revenue performance is directly attributable to subscriber losses, particularly broadband RGUs over the last 12 months. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted OIBDA has declined faster than revenue, due in part to higher content and network costs. P&E additions were $56 million or 27% of revenue, as we further expanded our new build activity to over 130,000 homes as compared to 77,000 in Q1. Finishing with Cabletica in Costa Rica. This business posted rebased revenue growth of 13% to $36 million and rebased adjusted OIBDA growth of 3% to $13 million, while P&E additions were 20% of revenue. Our top line continues to be driven by strong broadband volume and ARPU growth. Post-completion of the Telefonica acquisition, our Costa Rican operations were more than double in size, and we would expect to begin integrating the new business with our legacy operations during Q3. Moving to Slide 14. The chart show the last six quarters including the drop in our results last Q2, the positive impact of the Liberty Mobile acquisition beginning in Q4, and improving quarterly sequential results. With the addition of Liberty Mobile and improved financial performance, LLA delivered over $900 million of adjusted OIBDA in H1, which is a step up from where we were last year. As we think about rebased growth rates for the next two quarters, we would expect our rebased growth rates to be much lower than our Q2 levels. This is a function of more difficult comps in H2, as Q2 2020 was the financial low point for us from COVID. And with respect to adjusted OIBDA, we expect to incur most of the 2021 integration OpEx for Liberty Mobile in the second half. Notwithstanding this phasing of integration expense, we have lowered our conservative target for 2021 from $35 million to $40 million, down to roughly $20 million, of which, $3 million was incurred in H1. Turning to Slide 15, Q2 was quiet in terms of capital structure activity. At June 30th, we've reported $8.9 billion of total debt, $1.3 billion of cash and $1.2 billion of availability under our revolving credit lines. During Q3, we expect to draw approximately $290 million in bank loans to fund our acquisition in Costa Rica. The remainder of the $500 million purchase will be funded by LLA's corporate cash and by our 20% local partner. In terms of leverage at quarter end, we had gross leverage of 5 times and net leverage of 4.2 times. Our weighted average cost of debt a fully swap basis is running around 6%. And the average tenor of our debt is 6.3 years, which the debt maturity schedule on the bottom right clearly depicts. One change which Balan touched upon is that, we recommenced our share buyback activity and repurchased $10 million of equity during the quarter. It has been a year since we last bought back stock and based on the recovery we are seeing in our business, the confidence we have in our cash flows, and what we think is a highly attractive return. We thought it was smart capital allocation a good time to recommence the program. Moving to our final slide. For LLA, we posted strong financial growth as we continue to recover from the pandemic. Similar to Q1, our results were ahead of our own expectations for the quarter. No doubt, the macro-economic rebound and Latin America will take a considerable amount of time to take hold. And as such, we remain laser-focused on cost control. Our recent performance combined with our discipline around costs will position us to gain incremental operating leverage as a regional environment improves and influx. A key recurring theme for us going forward will be network infrastructure investment, and as we have highlighted today, we are upsizing our fiber expansion, but importantly staying within our CapEx and free cash flow envelope. Our inorganic strategy has not only enabled LLA to drive scale, efficiencies and synergies, but has been critical and enabling us to better serve our customers' needs with fixed and mobile connectivity in markets like Puerto Rico, Curacao and soon to be Costa Rica in Q3. Specifically, in a market like Puerto Rico, we've been able to create a US-like FFC business that generated over $300 million in adjusted OIBDA in just the first six months of 2021. To close out our prepared remarks, we remain confident on delivering our LLA consolidated targets, and are setting the stage for continued growth in 2022. We were also pleased to publish our inaugural ESG report last month, and look forward to sharing more information through future disclosures as we further develop our program. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.
Operator: The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically.  We will begin with Soomit Datta with New Street Research.
Soomit Datta: Hi, guys, thanks very much. Two or three quick questions if I could please. Just on the buyback first of all that has come through a little bit quicker than I was maybe expecting. Could you give any thoughts on the program looking forward? I think maybe is it $90 million or so authorization? Do you envisage kind of being in the market just on a regular basis? Or is it more you know, kind of subject to perhaps where the share prices, so some kind of sense on your thinking that would be great, please. And secondly, just on the integration costs. It sounds like you've kind of net-net saved some money or saved some potential money there. I'd be interested in a little bit more as to where that's come from? And, you know, looking into 2022, do you think there might be room to reduce those costs further? And then a final quick one, if that's okay. Just on detail around the numbers for Liberty Mobile in Puerto Rico. It looks like it's kind of generating about a 42% EBITDA margin, if I'm looking at that correctly in terms of the revenue and EBITDA you called out that seems to be kind of super profitable. Is that the right way to look at it? Is it on a kind of new trajectory? Any color there would be really helpful. Thanks.
Balan Nair: Hello, Soomit, thanks for your questions. Let me just flip through them. The first one on the buyback. You know, we've always been very careful in our capital allocation. And I think if you look at where our equities trading right now, it just makes sense. And as Chris pointed out in his comments, we are clearly quite bullish about the future here. And what we had from a Board authorization was $100 million. So we are clipping through that, and on how we do is, as you would imagine, we have a grid. And so we'll execute to our grid, and but we feel really good about it. On the integration costs. Our integration costs, you know, it went down this year. I think it's partly also, you know, we've been quite conservative in our integration costs. And there's some expenses around, you know, licensing and et cetera, on with our vendors that we were able to avoid, and that contributed to it. And I suspect next year we'll have - certainly we'll have integration costs, but I don't see it going up, nor do I see it, you know, some of the cost cutting that we put into our integration this year being repeated next year either. So it'll be kind of steady state. But according to our plan, and we feel really good about it. And then on the Liberty Mobile, we'll get back to you on the specific margins on the mobile side. But clearly the margins are all over the map. If you look at the equipment, the margins are pretty close to zero. You look at our postpaid, the margins are pretty good, on prepaid it's actually even better. And if you look at our roaming, then, it's the best, right everything just drops. So but clearly in Puerto Rico, it's, you know, if you look at our fixed business, the margins that have really improved as well. And if you look at more, a lot of our growth that came from the fixed part of our business there. Maybe I'll ask Chris or Naji, if you want to opine on the margins.
Chris Noyes: Yeah I would say, you know, obviously, on the margin side, you know, the lion's share of the OpEx integration will kind of start, you know, flowing through here in the second half. So that will be - that'll put some pressure on the margin as well from what you saw in the first half of the year.
Balan Nair: Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Soomit.
Soomit Datta: Thank you. Cheers, guys.
Operator: We'll now move to a question from Kevin Roe with Roe Equity Research.
Kevin Roe: Thank you. Good morning. Balan, could you update us on the strategic direction for the Subsea Cable business and work to potentially separate that business? And secondly, the Delta variant, it's in the news every day in the US, it's causing some changes in corporate behavior. We've seen mass mandates from some companies there, some companies are paying employees to get vaccinated, some are mandating vaccinations. Are you taking any different approaches this time around with Delta to keep your employees working and your stores open?
Balan Nair: Hi Kevin. On the strategic side, I'll tackle that first. You know, clearly we're kind of started showing a bit more clarity or look through onto our Subsea asset. And we've done some work on, you know, what it would take to separate it out and accounting-wise, legal-wise, tax-wise, the whole thing. And it's a really good business and it's strategic to us. And, we have not made a final decision on the approach to that asset, I suspect between our Board and us sometime in the fourth quarter, we'll probably sit back and say, “Okay, do we want to test the value of that asset”. We clearly feel that it's from an SOTP standpoint, you know, this asset is undervalued in our whole infrastructure. And so we may look for ways to bring more clarity to that standalone value. On the Delta variant, you know, we're not treating it any different than, you know, than what we went through last year. If you recall, last year was, you know, I mean, this time last year was quite bleak. And we've learned a lot through it on how to react and how not to overreact as well. And if you look at our region, clearly, the vaccination rates are much lower than how we experience it here in the United States. That is a cause of concern for us. And because the Delta variant spreads across primarily with the non-vaccinated. On our employee base, we are leaning towards any of our employees that interact with customers. If you work in our retail stores, if you go into our customer homes, we would want you vaccinated. Now, clearly, this applies in some parts of our business, where vaccination rates are high. In some parts of our business if you look at Jamaica, where vaccination rates like 10% having such a rule, it's kind of meaningless, because you just can't get access to vaccines. But we certainly will when vaccination is very high in all of our regions. We will want to be a network provider that our customers feel safe having our technicians in their home.
Kevin Roe: Thank you.
Balan Nair: Thanks, Kevin.
Operator:  We'll now take a question from Matthew Harrigan, Benchmark. Go ahead, please.
Matthew Harrigan: Thank you. Congratulations on the results. I was just curious, you've got a lot of touch points with very sophisticated businesses, even the enterprise customers in the Caribbean area and the Canada with your Subsea network. What do you perceive as the UCAS opportunity there? I mean, clearly the region lags the US to a certain extent, but it feels like you're pretty well positioned to coming out of the blocks. I know that's more of a conceptual than an immediate block-and-tackling question. There's a lot going on. But I was just curious given your positioning. Thank you.
Balan Nair: Hey, Matt. On the enterprise side, I'll say from our Subsea businesses, it's a tale of two stories. The carriers, the wholesale guys are just seeing ever increasing demand for bandwidth. And we've been putting in capacity for a lot of our customers. From an enterprise standpoint, I think it's one that we've been kind of looking at strategically and trying to convince a lot of the hyperscalers that   matters, and having a bigger and better presence in our region is important for them. So, as an example, a lot of them on their edge data centers actually do not have them located in our region. And so that is, you know, it's driven by two things, one, you know, the volume of people, and two, the lack of focus. And we've been having some conversations with some of the hyperscalers around. You do need to have presence in our region come into Costa Rica, come into Panama, come into the Caribbean, and you would be surprised with the connectivity that's available, the pop that's available, the data centers that we have as well. So there's a simulation part to that business.
Matthew Harrigan: Great. Thanks, Balan.
Operator:  We'll pause to see if there's any further questions today. With no additional questions, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the call back over to Balan Nair for any additional or closing remarks.
Balan Nair: Thank you, operator. And thanks everybody on the call. You know I am actually very happy with our progress. Clearly, we're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel getting brighter and brighter. We will continue to work very hard for you. My team is committed to that, the management team, the whole company is committed on that for you and for our customers. So thank you for your support and encouragement. Have a great day.
