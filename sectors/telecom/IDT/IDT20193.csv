Shmuel Jonas: Thank you, operator. Welcome to IDT's third quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call covering results for the three-month period ended April 30, 2019. For a more detailed report on our results, please read our earnings release filed earlier today and our Form 10-Q which we will file with the SEC.IDT’s third quarter results were consistent with recent trends. Although revenue was down substantially, we were able to maintain gross profit while continuing to invest in our growth initiatives. We increased revenue less direct cost of revenue in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and have generated year-over-year increases in revenue less direct cost of revenue for six of the last seven quarters.We have been rapidly reallocating resources from our core offerings. This approach has allowed us to maintain consolidated SG&A in a tight range between $49.5 million and $51 million for each of the past five quarters. We were able to increase adjusted EBITDA 10% year-over-year to $8.9 million in the third quarter and to increase income from operations to $2.7 million from a loss from operations of $1.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Our growth initiatives continue to perform well. net2phone’s unified communications business generated $6.7 million in revenue this quarter compared to $3.7 million a year ago. The net2phone team has done a great job. As of April 30, net2phone served 89,000 seats. National Retail Solutions revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $1.5 million, and our POS network now serves over 7,000 independent retailers around the country. BOSS Revolution money transfer revenue increased 34% year-over-year to $6.1 million.The growth was generated entirely by direct-to-consumer transactions originated predominately from our app. DTC revenue increased 98% year-over-year and now contributes about two-thirds of our money transfer revenue. Between agency [ph] transactions initiated by solution retailers, we are now well executing well over 300,000 transactions a month. Our MVNO continued to improve its message as we emphasize online acquisition.IDT and Tigo Honduras reached an agreement which is patented as our successful deal with Tigo Guatemala over some minutes and gross profit along the U.S.-Honduras border while providing customers with more options for international long distance calling. U.S.-Honduras border is not as heavily traffic as the U.S.-Guatemala border, but substantial nonetheless.Overall, we head into the fourth quarter in a strong position. We still face challenges on multiple fronts, but our team deserves great credit for the considerable progress we have made diversifying our sources of revenue and margin.Thank you very much. That concludes my remarks. Now, Marcel and I will be happy to take your questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
Operator: Okay. And there look to be no questions at this time. So this will conclude our question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call. Just want to thank you all for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect your lines."
