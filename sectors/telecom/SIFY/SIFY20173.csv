To reflect on our quarter performance, I will now ask Kamal, our CEO, to expand on some of the business highlights. Kamal?
Kamal Nath: Thank you, Raju. In quarter three, we have been able to continue the positive momentum from previous quarters, with healthy order book, revenue and profitability. Our experience over the years and track record in successful delivery of integrated ICT projects leading to foundation of digital transformation are being referenced by our new clients who are in similar decision zones. Our partnership portfolio is also being augmented with new-age technology partners to strengthen our vertical solutions and offerings.

In the light of the recent communication from NASDAQ, the Company is evaluating options and is confident that in due course the market price will reflect both the present intrinsic value and the growth potential of the Company. Cash balance at the end of the quarter was INR 2,055.40 million.
