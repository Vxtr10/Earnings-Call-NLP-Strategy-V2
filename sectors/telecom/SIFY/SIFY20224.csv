I want to say, well, the past few years, the hyperscaler cloud providers invested significant amount in India, convinced about the growth of India regarding the IT. Second, the government of India initiative of digital transformation have turned India into a proving ground for the local start-up ecosystem considered to be the third largest in the world. And what were the time -- the enterprises pent up demand for the automation post-pandemic has now stabilized into a long-term IT overall plan. They are now taking a comprehensive view of their overall IT architecture and aligning with the best breed of services for multi services and multiyear contracts.

Following the trifurcation of the businesses into a separate legal entities which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Sify Technologies Limited, they are now free to pursue partnerships for technology and capital to build operating effectiveness while leveraging the benefits of a unified sales and marketing team to execute the go-to-market strategy. Over the long term, it will help us build more operating effectiveness, while retaining our identity as the only true converged ICT services player. We continue to make selective investments, in particular, on people and tools to meet the customers' digital transformation demand. Our commitment to expand our data center footprint and network remains while staying disciplined on the fiscal health. Cash balance as at end of the year was INR4,591 million. I will now hand it over to our Chairman for his closing remarks. Chairman?
Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay Kumar. As I stated before, the government of initiative for a digital transformation of the country and our enterprise demand for a multi-services and multiyear contracts, positioning us in a unique confidence to ICT players, integration of our services portfolio give an advantaged view of the emerging scenario and ability to cater to this demand. Thank you for joining us on this call. Now, I will hand over to operator for questions. Operator?
Operator:  Your first question for today is coming from Greg Burns. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
Greg Burns: Yes. Itâ€™s Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Good morning. So I just wanted to start with this idea that your -- the fact that you have a multitude of services, the network, the data center services, that's an advantage for Sify in terms of capturing demand. Can you just talk maybe about an example of where you've had a customer that started with one service, how you've expanded there or how that's been an advantage for you? And maybe contrast that to the competitors that you have in India? How you differentiate yourself through that multitude of services?
Raju Vegesna: Kamal, can you address? Kamal?
Kamal Nath: Yes. Yes. Yes, so there are quite a number of customers. One of the largest customers which in fact, happens to be the largest bank in India and one of the largest global banks, State Bank of India, we had network services initially with them. And after that, they became our data center customer with almost now INR650 lakhs plus as well as we are doing the complete network managed services and network security managed services for them across all their branches as well data centers and branches across the globe also. So this is one example where three towers, network, data center and services, such a large bank has partnered with Sify Technologies. But multiple other customers for whom we have done -- for example, for National Stock Exchange, we are managing the network. We provide them some network infrastructure services as well as cloud and cloud managed services. We have a whole lot of insurance companies who have partnered with us for entire data center and cloud transformation as they moved away from the  system integration model to cloud-based digital-ready model. And we have at least four to five of such life insurance and general insurance companies who have partnered with us, apart from a lot of other manufacturing companies. So to summarize, every network customer is an opportunity for Sify for data center and digital services opportunities. Every data center customer who start with an opportunity for us for network and digital services. And in the mix of all these services, there are also engagements where we initially started with digital services, with complete operations outsourcing but later on, when the customer took their cloud transformation journey, they have subscribed to Sify's cloud services. So overall, I mean, the opportunities for us, irrespective of our landing zone, the first contact with the customer, is wide for us. I hope that answers your question.
Greg Burns: That does. And could you just -- I mean you discussed the competitive landscape, how differentiated is Sify in terms of the breadth of your services?
Kamal Nath: Yes. So in fact, our competition landscape is pretty spread out. I mean, in the data center space, we compete with NTT, STT, CtrlS, these kind of direct competition. In the network space, we compete with the likes of Airtel and Tata Communications and Jio. On the cloud transformation space, we compete with the likes of  Global India MNCs like TCS, TCS, Wipro, HCL, Kyndryl, I mean which is the spin-off division of IBM. In the digital transformation space, we compete with the likes of TCS, IBM and a whole lot of new age cloud services companies who are niche boutique farms, these are not very big names but they are growing stronger in the market. So overall, we have multiple kinds of competition in multiple segments but with our cloud at the core offering, ranging from data center, network which are cloud aligned as well as the services on top of this infrastructure which we own and we offer to our customers. And also on top of that, our partnership with the leading hyperscale cloud providers, make it a very compelling proposition for Sify from our side. And for customers, they did not go to multiple service providers or multiple technology providers to stitch up the entire digital ICT platform for themselves.
Greg Burns: Okay, perfect. I don't think you talked about the -- your data center capacity. How many megawatts do you currently have online and what the plans are for this coming fiscal year in terms of capacity additions?
Raju Vegesna: Yes. Vijay, you might like to answer this?
M. P. Vijay Kumar: So we have close to 100 megawatts in operations and we are building 100 more megawatts in the project stage.
Greg Burns: And that's over the next 12 to 18 months? I guess, there a time frame on kind of when that -- or is it multiple years? Like, what's the time frame on ?
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Yes, that is next 18 months. 18 months.
Greg Burns: Okay. And then you mentioned your cash position. Where did the debt balance stand at the end of the year?
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Yes. So Greg, as far as the cash balance is concerned, we have about 450 million  of cash available, 4-5-0 million  of cash available. And equally important, you are aware of both the partnership we have with an alternative investment fund for further capital for expansion. And we have done financial closure for all our greenfield projects which are currently underway. So we are well capitalized to execute all our expansion projects.
Greg Burns: Okay. I think you -- I might have missed it but the total debt or the -- where you are in terms of that at the end of the year?
M. P. Vijay Kumar: As far as the total debt is concerned, the total debt is about INR7,000 million. And on top of that, the recent investment from the alternate investment fund which is convertible into equity at a later date which is of another INR2,000 million.
Greg Burns: Perfect. Okay, thatâ€™s all I have for now. Iâ€™ll hop back in the queue. Thank you.
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Thank you.
Operator:  You have a follow-up question coming from Greg Burns. Greg, your line is live.
Greg Burns: I just had one more if there's no one else. Can you just give us an update on the Indian economy? It sounds like from your comments, you're pretty bullish and it seems like we've moved past kind of the depths of the pandemic. But could you just give us a update on what's happening on kind of a macro level in India?
Raju Vegesna: So no, I was traveling last six, seven weeks and I am very bullish. The kind of the steps government is taking for the growth. And also, it's not only the government enterprises also very bullish. So those are the two things, I see a lot of energy, positive energy growing in the country and that's the way we believe there is a great potential for us as an ICT player.
Greg Burns: Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks for the update.
Operator:  There are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Raju Vegesna: Thank you for your time on this call. We look forward to interacting with you through the year. Stay safe, stay healthy and have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's event. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."
