A. Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay Kumar. On this call last quarter, I have spoken about the need for a stable majority to win government as the first point of the rival – of the economy that question has been answered. The challenge now is to cater to the clients who wish to see the upcoming opportunities in the market. But will be closely examine both their IT investments and their cost structure in light of the lessons learned over the past two years.

Now I will hand over to the operator for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mohan Raju with Barclays [ph]. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Congratulations to the management on the good beginning of the financial year with our revenue growth in Q1. My question to the management as a reference to be improved economic outlook, which is prevailing in the country post the recent elections. Does Sify see this is opportunity to show stronger growth in revenue as well as profitability in this financial year? If yes, in what will Sify is ready to make the most of this positive outlook in the economy today to improve your revenue and profitability?
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Yeah. Mohan, thanks for joining us on the call today.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
M. P. Vijay Kumar: And thank you also for your kind words, I’m Vijay Kumar here Mohan.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, Mr. Vijay Kumar.
M. P. Vijay Kumar: As regards to your queries, results forward-looking in terms of financial performance outlook, but nevertheless as both Chairman Mr. Raju Vegesna and Mr. Kamal Nath shared in their remarks. The outlook has been positive and the revenue growth trend over the last several quarters has been good, we should in all likeliness be in a position to maintain similar performance. And as you know the outlook in India is now looking positive from overall business confidence perspective and with more investments expected to happen on infrastructure including IT infrastructure. These should be good days for Sify going forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Absolutely. So that means good revenue growth as well as profitability for Sify going forward?
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Yes, should be.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Kamal I would like to know. Yeah, I have one question for Kamal?
Kamal Nath: Yeah.
Unidentified Analyst: What are the unique ways in which Sify is aligned to tap this opportunity? I could see you mentioning about Data Center investment and so on, one of the other unique ways in which the company is aligned?
Kamal Nath: See every year’s as our Chairman has also mentioned in his part of the session that every organization is looking for more efficiency – more efficient and at a lesser cost. I think by virtue of our very business model, we are ready to align ourselves to that customer need. So, I just to give an example, as I have also mentioned during my session in a main conference call that when a client moves to our Data Center, I mean there is in a short reduction of costs. Now, this is one area where the traditional IT services player history very, very strong with the customers IT services player in the Data Center history build by the like so IBM, HP, HCL and Wipro’s of the world, but there is definitely now a shift where the customer is actively considering a so called service provider like us, in signing the main contract with them, which is our own Data Center transformation. So, the reason we’re confident is because over the past two years we have prepared ourselves, in a fully believing that the Data Center, so called Data Center infrastructure provider can transform themselves into a Data Center IT services provider and probably eat away the pie from the traditional IT services player and which can – which ultimately would result – higher revenue for us. So to answer your question earlier, we still only get the – in our Data Center hosting part of the business, but now I think, increasing do you have seen that the customers are interesting as with the IT services and even you know the hardware and software part of it also. So that is distinctively one area where you know if we’re engaged of the Data Center layer with the client than both in terms of the absolute value and the value chain we are moving highest.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you very much for the clarification and I wish Sify and the entire management team for a good financial year forward. Thank you.
Kamal Nath: Yeah, thank you Mohan, thank you Mohan for participating.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Mr. Vegesna there are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the call back to you for closing comments.
