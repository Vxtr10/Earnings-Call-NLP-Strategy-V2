I will now hand over to the Operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti. Please proceed with your question.
Greg Burns: Can you please just give us a little more color on whether technology integration services and AIS versus were down so much in the quarter and do you expect those businesses to show growth for this year? Thank you.
Raju Vegesna: These two businesses involved to a large extent customer specific projects and there were projects for which orders have been won in the past and they were under implementation. For customer specific reasons the implementation has got delayed beyond the quarter and they will get converted at revenue. Between the last year and the current year there isn't unlikely to be any degrowth.
Greg Burns: Okay. And do you expect those like is this second quarter do you expect them to be rolled out in the second quarter, third quarter like what's the timing on?
Raju Vegesna: It should be between the second and third quarter.
Greg Burns: Okay. What are your -- how much CapEx are you expecting for the full year this year?
Raju Vegesna: The capital expenditure for this year as far as the projects which are already underway is concerned, the committed CapEx is about $30 million but we continue to evaluate additional opportunities for expansion and we will keep you informed as we take those decisions.
Greg Burns: Okay, and then lastly can you talk about the wireless aspect of your network, do you own any spectrum? Is there any risk that you lose access to the spectrum you're using and do you have enough access to spectrum to continue to grow the business?
Raju Vegesna: We operate on a combination of both licensed and open spectrum and there is no change in this expected in the future.
Greg Burns: Okay. So you feel like you have access to lot of spectrum?
Raju Vegesna: Yes. And there is good amount of growth happening through fiber on the ground and we have our metro expansion plans which have been executed over the last couple of years. So that’s also contributing to the growth of our data and managed services.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Greg Burns. Please proceed with your question.
Greg Burns: Can you talk about your data centers, how much of your existing footprint is currently concentrated for and what are your plans in terms of new data centers online this year? Thank you.
Raju Vegesna: As far as the existing facilities are concerned 5 out of the 6 large facilities are fully sold. The sixth one is getting monetized as per the plan and there is additional capacity being created, the $30 million which I mentioned to you, a new capacity is getting created now for which we have a committed investment and there are good opportunities for growth in this business and we will invest as we go along.
Greg Burns: Okay and looking at your application integration services, what percent of that business is iTest?
Raju Vegesna: In the application integration services iTest constitutes about 60% of the total application and integration services business.
Greg Burns: Okay. And thinking about I guess the growth drivers of iTest and basically what should we be looking for in terms of continued growth of iTest and what are the triggers domestically get more business?
Raju Vegesna: Yes. On the application and integration services we have two streams, one is the home grown applications which includes this iTest and we have integration services on the industry standard applications. So the growth for the future will come from both of these streams particularly on the industry standard applications where there is significant action happening where people are moving those applications from on-premise to the cloud and given that we are in established infrastructure services player in the country and we have demonstrated experience of moving applications on to the cloud, good amount of growth in the future should come through that stream as well. While iTest will grow the other part of application [indiscernible] services should also start doing well in future without me sounding to be forward-looking since you asked this specific question for understanding I'm responding on it.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Raju Vegesna: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call and we are looking forward to interacting with you through the coming years. Have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
