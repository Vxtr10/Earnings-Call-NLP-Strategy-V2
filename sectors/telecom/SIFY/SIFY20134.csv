This year we will add our datacenters; already the Noida datacenter is in operation and Rabale datacenter is getting ready. We have continuously invested in our capacity because of our conviction that the market is still in the early stages of the growth.

I will now hand over to you, Vijay. Vijay is our CFO to talk on the financial highlights of this year.
MP Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Kamal, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide detailed financial results for financial year 2012. Sify’s revenues for the year were at INR 8570 million as against previous year’s revenues of INR 7698 million, an increase of 11.3%. EBITDA for the year was INR 802 million as compared to INR 490 million last year, a growth of 63.6%. The net profit for financial year 2013 was INR 477 million as against a net loss of INR 385 million in financial year '11-'12. This net profit includes a one-time gain of INR 658 million from sale of stake in an associate company in early part of the year. Cash flow from operations was INR 603 million for the year as against INR 600 million last year. Cash balance at end of the quarter was INR 999 million. As our chairman rightly quoted, it has been a challenging year for many telecom and IT service companies in India, but our fixed adherence to tight fiscal discipline has ensured that we are comfortably within our business plan. Operating cash flow continues to be positive and gross margins have remained steady in spite of continuing pricing pressure in the market. As a result, our EBITDA continues to show positive momentum and support by fiscal restrained and growing business which is increasing our utilization of core business assets. We will continue to make necessary business investment, but our main focus will be to leverage our existing asset base and to add capacity as we fill our current facility. I will now hand you over to Raju for his final comments.
Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay. Let me recap. Sify reengineering as a product and practice driven company is complete. There is a lot to be done this year. The coming year we will be investing in products and services that will deliver value at multiple price points for large enterprises and emerging enterprises and SMB clients. We are making steady progress in our financial results as you can see, and I'm confident that Sify is on the right path. When the anticipated turnover happens in the market, we will be well-positioned to ride the wave. Thank you for joining us in this call. I will now hand over to operator for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Okay. It seems there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over for closing comments.
