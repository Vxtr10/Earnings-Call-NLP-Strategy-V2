I’m happy to report that we’ve performed well in a quarter that’s typically challenging for the enterprise segment.

And many of whom experienced this year impact on their homes and family lives, but delivered superior service to their customers who were counting on Sify for mission critical high Sify services and solutions. Many of our clients reported an increased depreciation of the value in having a single window overview of their entire outsource services with us. As we grow our India customer base and we are increasingly positioning ourselves as a global player leveraging our India scale to serve global enterprise customers.
