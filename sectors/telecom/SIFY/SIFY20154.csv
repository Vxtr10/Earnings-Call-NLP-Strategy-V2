We also actively pursue opportunities stemming from new digital transformation models, with a focus on remote infrastructure management and digital learning. Within India, we are seeing the early signs of renewed economic confidence, and we are well-positioned to benefit from an improved economic climate, given our successful delivery of client projects and penetration across the different enterprise segments.

The business was confined to prestigious CIO Choice 2015 honor and recognition award for its suit of Integrated Data Centre solutions. Cloud and Managed Services; the Cloud and Managed Services business revenue grew 21% over the previous year, the business added 41 customers in the year; 12 of them for the newly launched data center transformation services.

I will now hand over to you Vijay, our CFO, to expand on the financial highlights for the year. Vijay?
Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Kamal, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide detailed financial results for the financial year 2014-2015. Revenue for the year ended March 31, 2015 was INR 12,864 million, an increase of approximately 23% over last year. Revenue for the quarter was INR 3,594 million, an increase of about 37% over the same quarter last year. EBITDA for the year was INR 2,005 million, an increase of 27% over last fiscal. Net Profit for the year was INR 389 million, an increase of 22% over last year. Capital expenditure during the year was INR 944 million and cash balance at the end of the year was INR 1,471 million. We are pleased to report over 20% growth in revenue amidst a business environment that can best be described as cautiously optimistic. We managed to hold steady on both revenue growth and cost management. We continue to weigh new investment options against emerging business opportunities to scale our business, while at the same time improving our current asset utilization. Net profit for this fiscal year has grown, but was did not keep pace with the comparably higher growth in revenue and EBITDA. This reflects the higher depreciation and financing costs, relating to our investments in capacity and increased working capital with the higher business volume. Based on the significant one-time investments we have made in the last two financial year, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, it will be a little more time before we can fully monetize our investments, especially the data centers. However, our planned investments for 2015-2016 tends to be more incremental and directly linked to increases in volumes or new customer engagements. As I round off, I'm pleased to state that the Board has recommended a dividend of 10% subject to the shareholders approval. I will now hand you over to Chairman for his closing remarks. Chairman?
Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay. Last year has been a price consolidated services which providers who offered the entire ecosystem, this enabled two things for us; one, which endorsed our status as a single window provider of IT solutions and services, thereby ensuring price or monetary about the site [ph]. It allowed us to compete our full scale IT transformation project, in several cases, our technical and cost competitiveness was the game. This year we will look further enforcing that stature. There are two success of a brand is how it can stay disclosed in the phase of adverse conditions towards that end Sify has proven that what it takes to be successful and enduring enterprise player. Thank you for joining us on the call. I will now hand over to the operator for any questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I will turn back to management for additional comments. Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Peter, Private Investor. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Peter: Hi, this is Alexander Peter. I just wanted to know like what are the future plans of entering the American and European markets where you see other IT players who are having about 50%, 60% revenue coming from this market. So we just wanted to have an idea on that. Thank you.
Raju Vegesna: This is Raju, you are right. So if we look at it, so far we're very much focused India player and that is very competitive market and a low priced market, they are very  we are like a company very successful and profitable. Now the market of North America and Europe is a very good opportunities for us, and as you know we started building a team last year and we are building the business opportunities and the funnel. As you go this year and major year, you are going to see the progress in this market, you are right, and lot of the IT companies  60%, 70% of it comes from these countries and we are aware of that and we are looking at how do we enter into that market and then we already know that market is already very crowded and we are looking at approaching this market where our sweet spot and where Sify kind of service provider game plays in this market, that is the way we are going to enter into that market.
Alexander Peter: Thank you, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mohan Raju with Airtel Limited. Please proceed with your question.
Mohan Raju: Hi, good morning everyone. First of all, very warm congratulations to the entire Board on 23% revenue growth and Sify has basically maintained the profitability in the competitors market. My question is specifically towards the opportunity of Internet of Things and the M2M space which is very fast in preparation as well as the government segment. So how Sify aligns today towards this and what are its future plans to tap that exponentially growing segment?
Raju Vegesna: Mohan, thank you, this is Raju again. So both internet processing and M2M will provide the opportunity for enterprise customers. As you look at Internet of Things, it's most of consumer place as you can take but ultimately the consumers using more Internet of Things and M2M, especially Internet of Things that produces lot of the data, and that data sustains in the cloud and the bandwidth requirements, both are opportunities for us in all the three segments having required more bandwidth, more connectivity on the networking side and more being the data is required to do the Internet of Things, that is helpful for our data centers and also our cloud platforms under storage especially. Same thing with M2M, making machines [ph] that gives you lot of automation in the technology, and with that automation, especially like if you're looking at a service desk or a helpdesk, all those things will be automated, that brings a lot of productive tool. I think both these technologies we are aware of it, and we are participating in lot of the initiative, and we are watching and how this can be beneficial for a company that has a service provider. So I think those technology is very helpful for our future growth.
Mohan Raju: Sure, thank you for that insight and I wish Sify all the best for a fantastic 2015-2016, and a successful revenue growth and net profit next year. Thank you.
Raju Vegesna: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Mr. Vegesna there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back to you for any final remarks.
Raju Vegesna: Thank you for everyone joining us on the call and we are looking forward to interacting with you in the coming quarter. Thank you and have a good day. Thank you. Bye, bye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes todays teleconference. You may disconnect at this time."
