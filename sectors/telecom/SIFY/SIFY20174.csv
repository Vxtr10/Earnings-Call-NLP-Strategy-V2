This points to our maturity of the service portfolios, its flexibility, and the strong fit to the unique challenges of the Indian market. As India is doing a digital transformation, both by the public sector and the private enterprises, that continues to fuel new opportunities for Sify across the board. Let me bring Kamal, our CEO, to expand our business performance for the past year. Kamal?

I will start with our telecom-centric services. The revenue for the data and managed services business for the year FY '17-'18 grew by 9% over the previous year, while reduction in revenue from India voice termination [ph] due to reduction in IUC charges resulted in the overall telecom revenue falling by 2% over the last year.

Sify won a contract on network services in Nepal, which is the first in the geography and opens up the potential to cater to the SAARC countries sharing a border with India.

Let me bring in Vijay, our CFO, to elaborate on the financial highlights for the past year. Vijay?
M.P. Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Kamal, very good morning to everyone. Pleased to present the financial performance for the full financial year 2017–18. Revenue for the year was INR 2068 million, an increase of 12% over the last year. EBITDA for the year was INR 2,856 million, an increase of 11% over the last year. Net profit for the year was INR 924 million, an increase of 44% over the last year. Capital expenditure during the year was INR 1,888 million. We closed the year with a very strong quarter and significant increase in revenue. We continue to make selective investment in both infrastructure and tools. To leverage our existing infrastructure investment, we are focusing on bundling our data center centric IT services with our WAN and data center infrastructure; a strategy that is beginning to yield results. The board has recommended a dividend of 12%, which is subject to approval of shareholders. The cash balance as at the end of the year was INR 2,275 million. I will now hand you over to our chairman for his closing remarks. Chairman?
Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay. Over the years, Sify has successfully demonstrated its ability to grow up the value chain of its IT services. In the coming years, the clients and IT landscape will demand that we play the role of the IT strategist and architect. That will be the overall ambition of becoming an IT partner of choice. We will apprise you on our progress, until then thank you for joining on this call. I will now hand over to the operator for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Klieve with Noble Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Ben Klieve: All right. Thank you. Hi, Kamal, Raju, and Vijay, thanks for taking my questions today, guys. A couple of questions first regarding data centers, I'm curious about the size of your data center footprint, do you feel like the physical footprint that you have today is sufficient to continue growing at the 30% clip you've seen over the last couple of years, or do you think you're going to need to make investments in that here in fiscal '19 in a meaningful way?
Raju Vegesna: Yes, I think let me answer this thing. So I think the current data centers that is not enough, we are going to continuously investing in the data centers, and we acquired a land in Chennai and we acquired a land in Bangalore, and we are going to continuously doing probably one or two data centers in the next four-five years to cope up with the market. The demand for the data centers in India is very good and we see it's a continuous growth for us especially the data centers.
Ben Klieve: And the one or two that you're going to add over the next four or five years, is that total or are you saying you're going to add one or two each year for the next four or five years?
Raju Vegesna: One or two per year.
Ben Klieve: Okay, perfect, thank you. And because there is so much demand do you see expansion of state owned and competitor owned facilities that you can grow from as well, or do you think the growth that you see over the next few years is going to have to be driven by a facility that you own?
Raju Vegesna: No, the way we look at it is some of the things are enterprises, public sectors, they won't, but we see ourselves growing in one or two per year in the next few years for that demand coming from the enterprises and some public sectors also.
Ben Klieve: Okay, perfect, thank you. A few questions on the financial tier, so you've talked about the investments that you've made in growth over the last few quarters and its impact on gross margins, we saw gross margins slide again a bit about a 100 basis points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I guess, I'm curious where do you see gross margins in fiscal '19, do you think that decline is going to continue going forward or do you think the investments that you've made this year are going to translate to improved margins next year?
Raju Vegesna: Vijay?
M.P. Vijay Kumar: Yes, Vijay Kumar here. So as far as the investments are concerned, the investments particularly in the financial year '17-'18 have been largely on building capabilities within the organization in the are of managed services and application-led integration services, more so for industry standard application. And these investments are expected to yield positive results in the years to come, and just as our past strategy of focusing on creating datacenters and expertise around cloud is beginning to pay off now. These investments we believe are critical even if it means a hundred basis point reduction in the EBITDA margin because these are all investments for the future, and ensuring that our services portfolio is relevant for the market.
Ben Klieve: Got you, yes. For what it's worth, I complete agree that those are critical investments to make. I guess I'm curious do you think that the kind of rebound. Do you think you're going to see that here in kind of the first-half of fiscal '19 or do you think the expansion in growth margins is going to take a few more quarters?
M.P. Vijay Kumar: I wouldn't like to venture at this stage on making anything forward-looking, but if you were to go on the basis of our past credentials, the investment should start paying off soon. But having said that, we will continue to expand on our competencies and capabilities in the services area, and invest in people including on learning and development.
Ben Klieve: Okay, perfect. Thank you. So you just said you hesitate on forward-looking statements here, but I guess just roughly with capital expenditures, can you help us understand kind of what you think your CapEx spend this year may be relative to fiscal '18. Do you think it'll be about the same? You think it'll increase a bit? Kind of directionally, where do you think CapEx is going to go this year?
M.P. Vijay Kumar: Directionally it'll be marginally higher than what we have spent in the last year. And these investments will be largely around the datacenter, which Chairman had articulated a little while earlier.
Ben Klieve: Okay, perfect. And then last question from me, and I'll jump back in queue here. The 12% dividend yield that you just talked about, now that's a significant yield and major step up. I'm curious is this going to be one-time dividend or are you going to spread it out and have a quarterly dividend payment going forward?
M.P. Vijay Kumar: As far as the company's dividend philosophy is concerned, the last four years it has been an annual dividend. And we stepped up the dividend last year. And we are maintaining it consistent for this year which is the recommendation of the Board to the shareholder. So we will continue with our philosophy of annual dividend.
Ben Klieve: Okay, very good. All right, thank you for taking my questions. I will get back in the queue.
M.P. Vijay Kumar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Raju Vegesna: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call. And we look forward to interacting with you all through the year. Have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."
