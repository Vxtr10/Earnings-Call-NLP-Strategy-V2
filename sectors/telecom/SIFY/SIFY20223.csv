Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Praveen. Good morning. Thank you for joining all of you. Given the proactive governance to the pandemic, India is better place through the third phase that we are currently experiencing -- experience. Digital IT infrastructure across the country has been scaled up aggressively since the Network and Data Centers are declared essential services. Indian businesses are now convinced all the importance of the business processes continuity, converge with services of seamless business output. Sify has led to the both a search of the services from a cloud-based local startups, cloud bond -- native cloud bond startups local and growing Hyperscalar investments in Indian IT infrastructure. As you know, this is digital at the core as the WAN, we are seeing as the right time for Sify to scale up to capture all these opportunities. Let me bring in Kamal Nath, our CEO, to expand on some of the business highlight for the past quarter. Kamal?
Kamal Nath: Yeah. Thank you, Raju. Enterprises looking for cloud-based Digital Transformation Services see our digital first bouquet of services as a natural fitment for their evolving business demands. We are seeing an upswing in demand for our cloud@core services as the right delivery model for these demands. Our successful delivery for Hyperscalers is a strong endorsement of our agility and capability on the Data Center front and increases the attractiveness of our Data Centers to our Enterprise clients. With the market learning to work around the pandemic, these demands should continue. As with previous quarters, I would like to expand on the business highlights and summarize our business performance. As part of our corporate venture capital initiative, Sify has further invested during the quarter US$100,000 in the earlier announced startups in the Silicon Valley area. Sify committed to a capital outlay of INR9,900 million toward fresh capacity building for data center expansion in the Navi Mumbai region. This is in addition to the capital outlay of INR1,200 million for expansion of DC capacity in the same region. Sify Technologies has been recognized as a Niche Player in the 2021 Gartner Magic quadrant for Managed Network Services. The recognition is for completeness of vision and ability to execute leading to superior quality of service. The business continues to grow the reach of the network. As on 31st December, 2021, Sify provides services via 769 fiber nodes and 1,893 wireless base stations across the country, a 6% and 11% increase, respectively, over the same quarter last year. As part of its Digital Experience Project, Sify completed full automation of service assurance, asset management and service provisioning across its network. This will accelerate the deployment of a streamlined customer experience in the coming quarters. To summarize our business performance, revenue from Data Center colocation services grew by 44% over same quarter last year. Revenue from Digital Services fell by 18% over same quarter last year. And revenue from Network Centric Services grew by 8% over same quarter last year. The revenue split between the businesses during the quarter was Data Center colocation services at 30%, Digital Services at 24% and Network Centric Services at 46%. A detailed list of our key wins is recorded in our press release now live on your -- on our website. Let me bring in Vijay, our CFO, to elaborate on the financial highlights for the past quarter. Vijay?
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Yeah. Thank you, Kamal. Good morning, everyone. Let me briefly sum up the financial performance for the third quarter of financial year 2021-2022. Revenue was INR6,783 million, a growth of 8% over the same quarter last year. EBITDA was INR1,574 million, an increase of 22% over the same quarter last year. Profit before tax for the quarter was INR477 million, an increase of 19% over the same quarter last year. Profit after tax was INR344 million, an increase of 36% over the same quarter last year. Capital expenditure during the quarter was INR2,887 million. The customer demand for Digital Infrastructure Services continues to be encouraging. We will continue to expand on our Data Center and Network capacity. Our fiscal discipline will continue right through our investment journey without impacting customer experience. Cash balance at the end of quarter was INR2,381 million. I will now hand over to our Chairman for his closing remarks.
Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay. India was already in the midst of the transformation of legacy systems through the adoption of automation. The pandemic only accelerated that process. In this process, some of our services matured through the adoption of enterprises, several are fine tuned by the enterprise demand. Some are more had to be completely overhauled. The current Sify bouquet of services fits well with the market demand. Thank you for joining us on this call. I will now operate -- now I’ll hand over to the Operator for questions. Operator?
Operator:  Your first question for today is coming from Greg Burns. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
Greg Burns: Good morning. Greg Burns with Sidoti & Company. I just wanted to ask about the -- first about the Kotak investment. What was the rationale behind taking that investment in the contact center business and what benefits do you see from their involvement? Thank you.
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Shall I?
Raju Vegesna: Yeah. Vijay Kumar, please go ahead.
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Yeah. Thanks, Greg. Kotak is an alternate investment fund, which is managed by one of the most established bankers in India, where the fund has LPs, which include sovereign wealth funds, which are among the best names, who participate in Data Center investments across the globe. As you are aware, Sify has a very active business presence in the Data Center Services and we have been continuously investing in expanding our Data Center capacity, considering the highly increasing demand for Data Center colocation services. So this investment from Kotak is through a compulsorily convertible instrument, where it is meant for financing or rather part financing some of our Greenfield Data Center capacity expansion over the next three years. So, that’s the background of the investment and the investment house.
Greg Burns: Okay. In terms of, I guess, the -- does it accelerate your ability to invest, does it give you greater flexibility, I am just trying to understand a little bit better what advantages taking that outside capital has for you?
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Yeah. So, it actually does multiple things. One is, it helps us fast track our Data Center capacity expansion as we tend to raise about $1,000 crores, which in terms of INR million is INR10,000 million amount of capital, which will be accessible to us for expansion needs along with the debt financing, which we can raise from the banking system, approximately with a debt equity ratio of 2 is to 1. It helps us to create substantial capacity over the next three years. And lastly, participation by an established banker and the sovereign wealth funds who are globally respected LPs also validate our Data Center business model and our competencies in this business. So it places before us capital for expansion and also gives us access to raise capital beyond what we have already contracted.
Greg Burns: Okay. Great. I guess, then, you mentioned also committing to INR9,900 million incremental investment in the Data Centers, is that all part of it is, like, with incremental…
M. P. Vijay Kumar: Yeah.
Greg Burns: … capital you raised from Kotak or is that separate from that, is that incremental and new or how should we read into that? And what’s the timeframe on kind of when you expect that investment to be made?
M. P. Vijay Kumar: The numbers which have been communicated to the press release are for the exist -- are for the Data Center projects where there is currently work in progress. Those will be financed by internal accruals and debt from the banking system. What we are raising from Kotak special -- Kotak Fund is for new greenfield projects for which the projects will be taken up effective from March of this calendar year.
Greg Burns: Okay. Okay. And then, in terms of, I guess, you reclassified the way you report your segments, within Digital Services, could you just give us an idea of the growth of the different pieces? I’m assuming Cloud and Managed Services was continuing to grow. But can you just give me a little breakdown of that 18% decline?
Kamal Nath: Yeah. Yeah. So as far as the Sify Digital Services are concerned, as you rightly observed, the Cloud and Managed Services continues to grow, whereas in this particular quarter, our Technology Integration Services, where we had a couple of large projects to be executed. Those projects execution is working progress and given the pandemic associated supply chain issues, those projects will get completed, hopefully, in this calendar quarter, in this quarter four. So the Cloud and Managed Services grown during the quarter and the others, particularly the Technology Integration Services, there’s a de-growth.
Greg Burns: Okay. I guess, since you brought it up in terms of the pandemic, where, I guess, what’s the status of the conditions in India, like, are you constrained by, like, mandates or lockdowns anymore? Is it -- is business getting back -- more back to normal there and what’s your view, I guess, looking forward in terms of maybe some of the constraints on the business in terms of the pandemic?
Kamal Nath: It’s getting back to normal. Except that with this Omicron, there are lockdowns specified in a few states for the weekend. Otherwise, the businesses continued to work as they are almost limping back to normal, except that many organizations are still pursuing work-from-home as a model. From a business perspective, as far as Chairman observed in his opening remarks, the Network and Data Center Services demand continues to be high and growing. And on the Digital Transformation Services, the customers are having extensive conversations and these conversations we expect to get converted into tangible orders and revenue conversion in the foreseeable future.
Greg Burns: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Kamal Nath: Thanks.
Operator:  There are no questions in queue at this time.
Raju Vegesna: Thank you. We appreciate your time on this call. We look forward to interacting with you through this year. Thank you very much. Have a great day.
Kamal Nath: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."
