Our continued growth in the face of uncertain economic environment has firmly established us a steady player in the Indian IT space. This year we’re pursuing integrated growth from the North American market to supplement our traditional Indian market profits. While we’re still on the earlier stages of our entry in this market we are gaining strong traction with the partner ecosystem and are already seeing a growth interest in services we’re offering in North America. Within India we see a gradually improving market with ITC services playing an important role in supporting the Prime Minister's call for digital transformation of India. He has confidence that we have an important role to play in enabling both the public and private sectors as right to leverage the benefits of digital transformation. To reflect of the past quarter I would ask Kamal, our CEO to expand on some of the business buyback. Kamal?

Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Kamal. Good morning everyone. I will now provide detailed financial results for the first quarter of financial year 2015, 2016. Revenue for the quarter INR 3407 million, an increase of about 15% over the same quarter last year. EBITDA for the quarter was INR 583 million, an increase of 21% over same quarter last year. Net Profit for the quarter was INR 85 million, a decrease of 25% over same quarter last year.

Our top line growth has continued into the first quarter of the new fiscal year which has also translated well into a good EBITDA growth however our continuing investment in the core assets to support this level of growth has resulted in a modest drop in the net profit. While continuing to support the investment required for sustainable growth, our primary financial focus is on optimal asset utilization and mean lower operational cost. We see potential for increased asset utilization in both our network and data center business which have driven most of the capital investment in the past. Cash balance as of the end of quarter was INR 1342 million. I will now hand you over to our Chairman for his closing remarks. Chairman?
Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay. It's strong and consistent performance to a challenging economic environment is sign of strong fundamental and a clear valid direction.

For both our enterprise and SME client that translates into a single point of [indiscernible], better utilization of time and resources and a comprehensive SLA, has clients begin to see this benefit, Sify should see plan to gain in the coming year.
