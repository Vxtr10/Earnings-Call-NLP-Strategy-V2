However, our integrated services approach around Sify's services on third-party solution is trending wide acceptance with the customers. For us we are able to address bigger pie of the customer IT landscape while working on lowering customer’s IT spend. This has both short and long-term significance for us as we move forward.

Data services within Telecom services grew by 34% over the same quarter last year.

I will now hand over the session to Vijay, our CFO, to expand on the financial highlights of this quarter. Over to you Vijay.
M.P. Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Kamal, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide the detailed financial results for the second quarter of financial year 2013, 2014. Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 was INR2505 million an increase of 22% over the same quarter last year. EBITDA for the quarter was INR424 million, an increase of 180% over the same quarter last year. Net profit for the quarter was INR111 million as against [ph] a net loss of INR57 million for the same quarter previous year after excluding a one-time gain of INR658 million from sale of associated associate as reported earlier. Capital expenditure during the quarter was INR700 million and cash balance as of the end of the quarter was INR1614 million. We are seeing a consistent upward trend in both revenue and profitability. Earlier, we have decided that future investment an infrastructure would be demand led. This has led to a deeper focus on monetizing existing capacity, which can be seen in our improving bottom-line performance. With the Noida Data Center ready and our new Mumbai Data Center being completed by end of this fiscal year, we should also start realizing additional revenue from the investments we have made over the last several quarters. The focus continues to be on higher possible asset utilization and lowering the operating cost which exceeds the momentum in our net result. I’ll now hand over to our Chairman for its closing remarks. Raju.
Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay. Like while – we must navigate carefully under the current market condition. I see these conditions are favorable for Sify following reasons; Clients will utilize the opportunity to consolidate vendors. Only those with robust infrastructure, consistent performance and a sound delivery system we will stand to gain. For us it is a very good opportunity to leverage our all five services and solutions to focus to up sell at the clients, a tighter market means clients are willing to pay for innovation across the products and services. I formally believe that as a team we have the people, resources and solution and drive to utilize and monetize the opportunities in front of us. Thank you for joining us on this call. Now, I will hand over to the operator for questions. Operator.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today’s is coming from Mohan Raju from Sify Technologies. Please proceed with your question.
Mohan Raju: Good morning, Kamal, Raju and Vijay. Congratulations for your quarter two results and important growth and continued profitability of Sify. Good to see the consistency in a tough market. A question from my side, recently we saw a press release of $23 million funds that Sify has kept aside for focusing on cloud Managed Services and Security. So in this regard just want to know is there any acquisition that Sify has made using this fund or plans to make. So if Kamal can highlight on this.
Raju Vegesna: Now I will address on this, what we are looking at this is basically as Sify as we want to present like instead of a non-adjusted [indiscernible] product at a service company in India. We are looking at some forward investments, looking at to bring some new technologies as we are having you know both Telecom and IT Services and top of that being as disruptive what I call is a disruptive is happening in the market the whole infrastructure technology and services. We want to bring some of the new services, such that the whole – our cliental will get come benefit and those are the things what we are looking at. Part of this thing maybe we invest some of our funds also to acquisition and also to build small startups and whatever the things make sense relevant for the Sify as a platform to grow and beyond our Telecom and Data Center infrastructure these are the services what our interest to fund this opportunities. That is what we are looking for.
Mohan Raju: Sure thanks. Thanks Raju for that.

Raju Vegesna: No, we cannot disclose until we have such things materialized. Yes, the such kind of opportunity is also happening, because the market is getting consolidated. So there are people in the telecom side, there are people in IT Services, there some consolidation is going to happen and yes we are looking for such opportunities.
