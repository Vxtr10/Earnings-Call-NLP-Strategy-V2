Raju Vegesna: Thank you, Trúc. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. As we closed 2014, all indicators point to cautious optimism in investment climate within in India. While there is increasing confidence that economy is poised for a long-term growth, it will still be some time before the business community commits itself to the significant new investments. Our proven mix of services and solutions are being viewed as a viable alternative given the constraints on capital, balanced by the pressure to go-to market more quickly. Sify’s flexibility and comprehensive ICT portfolio, combined with our OPEX-based service provider approach, is attractive to both emerging and established companies looking to revamp their legacy systems. Our success in delivering the pan-India network integration project for the DoPhas earned us the acknowledgment of our peers. Some of the India’s best IT companies are now our consistent partners, ensuring that our clients will receive both the best-of-breed technology and faster response times. To reflect on our past quarter, I would now ask Kamal, our CEO, to expand some of the business highlights. Kamal?

Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Kamal, and good morning everyone. I will now provide detailed financial results for the third quarter of financial year 2014-2015. Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was INR 3,147 million, an increase of approximately 17% over the same quarter last year. EBITDA for the quarter was INR 537 million, an increase of 30% over the same quarter last year. Net Profit for the quarter was INR 83 million, an increase of approximately 32% over the same quarter last year. Capital expenditure during the quarter was INR 201 million and cash balance as of the end of the quarter was INR 1,558 million. This quarter, both revenue and EBITDA showed healthy growth, over the last year, despite increase in operating costs. Our net profit remains under some pressure due to increase in depreciation. This was anticipated based on the significant investment deployed in our new Data Centres, which are still in the early phases of operations. Depreciation and other costs associated with the Network Integration project for the Government have also increased as we approach the complete handover phase. I will now hand you over to the Chairman for his closing remarks. Chairman?

The scalability across our entire service range ensures all types of clients are cater to and as of more OEMs come onboard, the quality of the end product has only be get better. Bottom line is that our clients will benefit from our cost effectiveness of our product portfolio and our knowledge of practices. Thank you for joining us on this call.
