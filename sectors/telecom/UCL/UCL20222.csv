Our uCloudlink 2.0 service accounted for around 68% of total DAT during the second quarter of 2021. Average daily data usage per terminal was 1.58 gigabyte in June 2022.  Next, I'll turn to Page 18, which show global diversification of our business. We had around 99% of total revenue from outside Mainland, China. During the second quarter of 2022, Japan contributed to around 38.1% of total revenue. For other countries revenue, the U.S. market had the largest contribution to our business with further development of our U.S. business, and we will continue to expand other markets such as Europe and Southeast Asia, etcetera.

Service-related revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 62.5% during the second quarter of 2022, compared with 48.5% during the second quarter of 2021. Revenue from international data connectivity service and local data connected service increased by 48.1% and 52.6% year-over-year respectively. This increase in revenues from data connectivity service was mainly attributable to our gradual recovery of international travel and the continuous development of our local data connectivity service business. Next letâs move to Page 21, which shows the revenue breakdown of our two business segments, mainly revenue from service and sales products. Our total revenue decreased by 6.3% from $90.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 to $18 million in the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in sales of data related products and others.  Revenue from service were $11.2 million, representing an increase over 20.7% from 9.3 million for the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue from international data connectivity service and local data connectivity service.  Next, letâs turn to Page 22 for gross margins of our business. Our service gross margin increased to 56.2% in the second quarter of 2022, compared to 45.4% in the same period of 2021. And our overall gross margin was 44.1% in the second quarter of 2022 increased from 28.1% during the same period of 2021. The increase of service gross margins during the second quarter of 2022 was primarily attributable to highest margin profile from international data connectivity service. Letâs now move to Page 23, which show the breakdown of our operating expenses excluding share-based conversations and others. Excluding share-based compensations, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 41% in the second quarter of 2022, compared with 61% during the same period of 2021. We had further streamlined our business operation, including optimizing labor costs, and our total operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation decreased to $7.3 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $11.8 million in the same period of 2021. Next, Iâll turn to Page 24. Operating cash flow turned positive during the second quarter of 2022 and was $2.5 million, compared to negative $6.1 million during the same period of 2021. This is primarily a result of , improved margin profile, and a controlled operating expenses. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits were $12.2 million as at June 30, 2022. Our CapEx was $0.2 million, compared to $0.3 million in the same period of 2021.  Let us move to Page 25.

Thank you and we will start our Q&A session.
Operator: Yes, thank you.  And today's first question comes from Vivian Zhang with Diamond Equity.
Vivian Zhang: Good evening. This is Vivian Zhang from Diamond Equity. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress you made this quarter. So, my first question will be about the gross margin. We saw the gross margin on both services and sales of products increasing this quarter, so, I would like to know what's the reason for the increase? Will you continue to maintain the gross margin at this level in future quarters? Thank you.
Yimeng Shi: Yes. Thanks, Vivian. Yes, regarding the gross margins improvement in the second quarters, first of all, there's a gross margin on service. That's a massive improvement, compared with the same period last year. As we explained in the earnings release, our revenue generated from the national data connectivity service increased a lot, compared with the last years. The gross margins related to the international data connectivity service is much higher than like a local data connectivity service, and that's the major contributions to an improvement of service gross margins. We expect the international travel is in the recovery and the most countries, more and more countries open the door to that to the traveler. So, we expect in the future, we have generated more revenue from international data connected service. So, we expect our service gross margin will keep this similar level and it will be   in the future, once we have more revenue come from international data connectivity service. And also, the second contribution related to the product, yes, our product gross margin is improving as well, mainly due to the mix of product sales related to high-end product selling like 5G's   products to the market. Yes, this year, this is a quarter, we delivered massive product â 5G-related product to the market. And we expect this trend will carry on in the following quarter and years? Thanks.
Chaohui Chen: Yes. So, I have some more comments about â sorry, I have more comments about this point, because âin the R&D side, we also put a lot of effort to improve our margin, improve our  , and the efficient of our data usage and the combination. And this also increased our margin capability. Another factor is, we are now some new design and some replacement of the â to optimize the hardware to improve our, more the profitability of our hardware and data connection together.
Vivian Zhang: Okay. I see. Thanks for that. So, my second question is that can you elaborate on the partnership you published in the second quarter and how shareholders should build this development? I mean, the partnership with ?
Chaohui Chen: So, which two partner? Yes.
Vivian Zhang: Yes, for partnership with  you published.
Chaohui Chen: Okay. Yes. Last year, we have signed  values our technology to improve efficient and connected quality in the IoT area. So it's just   and it's just a starting point. We believe, in the future, we have more partner because â to recognize our technology because our headcount technology not only in full coverage of IoT device, but also lower cost of operation cost because market network  reliability of IoT network connectivity. That's very useful to the IoT area. So, we hope in the future with   kind of partner can â working with us. For example, as you understand in our presentation, so we already imbed our service into the IP camera, IP loader, so â and also now apply into autopilot. So, we believe the  for better condition and lower operation cost is the   of our IoT application, less for cooperation partner similar like , this kind of partner. That's just a start point. And now we have more partner in this area. Thatâs for first one. For second one, we're working with the Ctrip because you can see now that global   is recovering. Before the COVID-19, we are already a big partner working with Ctrip. So, because we are the biggest channel and for mobile WiFi hotspot rental in China wireless channel. So, now we are prepared for recovery of COVID-19. So, now we are not only prepared for   in China, but in U.S. in the Southeast Asia, we have more   to prepare for the people recovering from the global travel this scenario.
Vivian Zhang: Okay. Got it. That helps. Thank you. Okay. That's all my questions. Again, congrats on the quarter.
