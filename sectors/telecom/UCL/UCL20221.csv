Revenue from local data connectivity service and PaaS and SaaS service increased 185.4% and 7.8% year-over-year, respectively.

Our total revenue decreased by 11.8% from US$17.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 to US$15.6 million in the first quarter of 2022.

Revenue from service were US$9.8 million, representing an increase of 17.2% from US$8.4 million for the same periods of 2021.

And our overall gross margin was 37.4% in the first quarter of 2022 increased from 31.3% during the same period of 2021.

Thank you and we will start our Q&A session.
Operator: We will now begin the Q&A session.  The first question comes from Vivian Zhang with Diamond Equity Research. Please go ahead.
Vivian Zhang: Good evening. This is Vivian Zhang from Diamond Equity Research. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is that can you give us some additional color on your Internet of Things solutions and its market opportunity?
Yimeng Shi: Mr. Chen, can you answer the question?
Chaohui Chen: Yes. For international business, we believe that we can see the stronger DAT, we can see – the first quarter of year 2022, we can see the data recovery. So DAT has increased. So that’s the data performance. From our product side, we know that only normal cloud SIM solution, now we have HyperConn solution. HyperConn means that we can provide much better experience for multi-network handover from the – more than ten second now can go to the millisecond, that's wonder of the new product, new service. And now is for 5G, we provide the 5G product. So we are now – already few vendors almost is only one vendor who can provide a global 5G network roaming. So because our 5G product with almost all countries, 5G radio band and also the 5G roaming capability that’s very rare in the industry. So all these preparations let us in a good position in a recovery of COVID-19 – after COVID-19, so I think we are in a good position.
Vivian Zhang: Okay. I see. So my second question is regarding the COVID-19 impact because we've seen some Chinese cities like Shenzhen reopening in the second quarter after the lockdown, but there's some controls may still be in place in the cities. So do you think there will be some recovery in revenues from sales of products in the second quarter, or those controls continue to affect your launch and manufacturing of 5G products given that your main manufacturers are based in Guangdong China? 
Chaohui Chen: Yes. It is impacted in the first quarter, especially, both Shenzhen and Shanghai because this supply chain is not the part of our supply chain based in the Shenzhen. And some part of our partner is based in Shanghai. It is impacted by the lockdown during the COVID-19 in China. But I think we consider in Guangdong, it’s early recovery. I think the second quarter, it's not any problem from a current scenario. Also we removed some of our supply chain from Shanghai to Shenzhen. So in the second quarter, we believe impact from the COVID-19 will be almost disappear. I think average impact by the quarter one, quarter two we can see is much, much better, so that's one of the situation. Another is because our first quarter, our new device product delivery, it is impact because lockdown in the first quarter for manufacturer and also is come because this quarter, the first quarter of the revenue and delivery and the source order has come from the last quarter, quarter four. Quarter four has heavy impact by the Omicron variant COVID-19. So I think second quarter will be much better.
Vivian Zhang: Okay. That's all. Thank you.
Operator:  This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jillian Zeng for any closing remarks.
