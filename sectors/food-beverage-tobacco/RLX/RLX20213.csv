Kate Wang: Thank you, Sam. And thanks everyone for making time to join our conference call today. Since the second half of the third quarter, there have been proactive regulatory developments through the global E-vapor space, including in China. Last Friday, November 26th, 2021, the State Council announced its decision to amend the detailed invitation regulations of the Tobacco Monopoly Law of the People's Republic of China, by adding new 65s, which states that implementation rules for next generation tobacco products, including E-cigarettes, shall refer to as relevant tools with respect to cigarettes on Brazil implementation, regulation of the Tobacco Monopoly Law.  On Tuesday, November 30, 2021, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration released a consultation paper entitled ""Electronic Cigarettes: A National Public Service  For Standards Information "" under the state's administration for market regulation, seeking public comment regarding national electronic-cigarette product standards. Yesterday, December 2nd, 2021, that State Tobacco Monopoly Administration released a consultation paper entitled Administrative Measures for Electronic-Cigarettes, seeking public comments regarding administrative measures, electronic cigarettes, covering various aspect, including production, distribution, and the retail sales, import and export, and inspections. We firmly support this amendment to the detail implementation regulations and have begun making any required change to fully compliant with the new regulations and administrative measures.  We believe the amendment will pave the way for long -term and sustainable growth in this sector. We are also aware of meaningful worldwide regulatory developments, which reflects similar trends globally. In the U.S., the FDA has made substantial progress, reviewed PMTA applications and granted its first e-vapor product authorization in October, demonstrating its reclamation of certain e-vapor products harm reduction effect. We hopefully follow global regulatory developments and uses regulation of e-vapor products as the global trend. In view grow, as countries worldwide recognized universal products harm reduction benefits for adult smokers.  With these regulatory developments specially in China, we believe the sector will enter a new era of development, an era marked by enhanced productivity and qualities. Hoffman takes social responsibilities, and an improved electoral property protection. As some of you may be aware, the third quarter was challenging on the commercial front for the entire industry value chain, which had been reflected in our key value chain partners financial results, previously. Misinformation from temporary negative public Jiong e-vapor sector, and the Walgreen Co. in our teen restrictions, in response to outbreaks in China, which we discussed during last quarter's earnings call, has a significant adverse impact on the retail sales and product procurement, our branded stores, since the latter half of the second quarter.  As a result, we have record 34% quarter-over-quarter decline in our net revenue. But we believe this revenue decline to be temporary and have a clear plan to achieve long-term healthy growth which Chao will explain in detail later. Despite those industry , we continued to focus on building a solid foundation for sustainable success. In the third quarter, we redoubled our scientific research efforts and continue to attract and recruit top talent to strengthen our sales, supply chain, and R&D capabilities. We are committed to providing adult smokers with innovative harm reduction production of the highest quality. Also, at RLX, we also plan and act for the long-term. Corporate social responsibilities have been an integral part of values since day one.  Into the third quarter, we unveiled our 2020 to 2021 corporate social responsibility report. Where in, we shared our progress with respect to our CSR initiatives. Some highlights, you put our industry-leading age verification system, sound flower system 3.0, with a cost of features to prevent under-18s. use. Our RLEX Care community service program to promote role revitalization in common prosperity. These accomplishments are a testament to our dedication to fulfilling our social responsibilities. We strive to positively impact our users, employees, and communities in which we live. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Chao Lu. He will elaborate further on some of our last quarter's initiatives and go over our operational and financial results in more detail. Chao, please go ahead.
Chao Lu: Thank you, Kate. And hello, everyone. I will start by sharing some of this quarter's major initiatives and developments and then walk you through our key financial metrics. We believe that offering the right products to the right use of segments through the optimal route-to-market will be the key to our sustainable, high-quality growth. To this end, we continue to expand our product offerings to meet the needs of diverse user segments and optimize our distribution and retail networks to ensure quality growth. With respect to product, we are focused on offering better and more tailored vaping products for various user groups to help engage new users with the right products. This quarter, we introduced E-cigarette, a new brand targeting adult smokers with a long history of smoking.  Our goal is to recreate an authentic smoking experience for adult smokers by launching 8 tobacco flavored cartridges in our initial stage. At the same time, we further upgraded  phone, a more accessible product line catering to price sensitive user’s needs. We also recently re-launched stellar or  in China, a premium device lines with upscale stack styling, including leather, lace, and other fashionable materials. We will continue to monitor user-experiences very closely and launch innovative targeted products at the right time. We also made several advancements in user-retention and engagements during the quarter. We successfully upgraded our membership system, enabling members to enjoy more benefits as they accumulate reward points.  A growing number of users are scanning the QR codes on their cartridges to collect ruble points, which will allow us to empower uses with instant product authentication. Separately, we have established more effective communication channels to provide unbiased, fact-based, scientific e-vapor product information to our users and the community. Finally, we are concentrating on distribution and retail channel optimization. Instead of engaging more distributors and expanding the number of our RELX branded stores, this quarter, we prioritized our existing distributors organizational upgrade. We encourage our distributors to hire exceptional talent and refine their team structure within each department. We optimize existing RELX branded partner store’s locations by identifying areas with high-retail sales potential and encouraging store owners to adjust their operation accordingly.  In addition, we provided online and offline training for store owners and sales personnel to enhance their communication skills and enrich their product knowledge, in order to counter the diverse effect from misinformation resulting from periodic negative publicity on all categories. We have also upgraded our digitalization system for branded partner stores, providing improved functionality and additional user portals to assist store owners and salesperson personnel in their daily operations. For our other retail outlets, our focus in the third quarter was to identify prime outlets for expansion through trials in various channels. These trials resulted in several initial successes, including strong momentum in lifestyle channels and other key accounts. In addition to our entities on high-quality growth, we are deeply committed to fulfilling our corporate social responsibilities.  We believe the healthy relationship between our products, users, shareholders and the community, has been essential to the growth we have achieved over RELX 's 4-year history. With this in mind, we'll work tirelessly to introduce new technologies to tackle industry pinpoints. For example, minor protection is one of RELX 's highest priority. We spend all efforts in our minor protection initiative, from product labels to trade channels and technology innovation. In June 2021, we began upgrading Sunflower System our technology driven minor protection system, to version 3.0, and currently equipped all of our branded store with the upgraded software. On the Sunflower System 3.0, all uses are required to complete name, plus ID number, plus face recognition, three-step clarification before purchasing.  After the amendment to China's national standards become effective, we will strictly comply with any upgraded product requirements. For example, we are prepared to include minor protection features such as child safety locks, similar to the feature which we have incorporated into our RELX ICE product lines back in 2019. As a Company that values long-term, high-quality growth, our commitment to social corporate responsibility is at the core of our daily operation. To echo what Kate has pointed out previously, our game has entered the second half with the State Council 's decision to amend the detail implementation regulations of that tobacco monopoly law and the subsequent release of consultation paper regarding National Electronics Cigarette Product Standards by the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, as well as last night's release of a consultation paper regarding an administrative measures on electronic cigarettes, covering various aspects, including production, distribution, and retail sales, import and export and inspections.  Different from the first half of the game when the sector lacked clear regulatory guidelines, this second half is marked by enhanced product safety and quality, authentic social responsibility, and improved intellectual property protection. The investments we made in products, talents, research, and compliance in the third quarter and beyond, will place us in an advantageous position on the new regulatory paradigms. We expect these investments to year-steady and sustainable growth soon, and to reward us and our shareholders in the long term.

My first question is, given the recent regulation update developments, would you like to share with us, how are your products portfolio involved going forward, and what changes can we expect to see in your existing product portfolio?

Could you actually share more color on your fourth quarter to date operations trends and also your outlook for next year given the current regulation update and also the COVID situation. Thank you.
Sam Tsang : Thanks very much, Lydia. So, regarding your first question, regarding our product portfolio. We do have already clear our current development strategy. As mentioned in the opening remarks, we try to offer device products to the rights future settlements, for the optimal route-to-market channel. So, we too are aware of the press conference held by the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration yesterday and also the announced product consultation of the National Electronic Cigarettes  vendors. So, if in the transition period of our new  requirement to become effective,  comply with the regulatory guidelines.  So, regarding what would we change to our current product offerings, if and or when the draft National Electronic Cigarettes  vendors become effective. We anticipate we may need to monetize some of our current offerings. However, we are very confident that such changes once be complex for our Company, technically. And we believe, as of course, we'll still continue to seek out and use our products as harm reduction alternatives. So, regarding your second question about our 4Q outlooks and 2020. We currently do not have any guidance for the quarter together with next year. So, we hope to share more when we have better clarity.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Charlie Chen, in China Renaissance. Please go ahead.
Charlie Chen : Thank you, managements, to take my questions. I have 2 questions . The 1st one is could you please share your observations on the current competitive landscape for this industry. Are there any changes compared to the first half of this year? And also, what are your thoughts on the retail pricing for the  environments? So that's the 1st question. And my 2nd question is regarding single-store sales. So, what are the single-store sales will tax branded partner stores for now, from your perspective, do you consider to be a healthy  store sales level? Thank you very much.
Sam Tsang : Thanks very much, Charlie. I mean, there are 2 questions. One is on the competitive landscape and the other one is on our RLX branded stores. So, I mean, on the first one, as mentioned before or during the latter half of the second quarter, we do see that the industry that analysts did not progress as expected. So indeed, these has carried into the third quarter where we do see that there are external factors affecting the entire industries, including our Company and also our peers to varying degrees. But indeed, regarding competitive landscape, we have observed good deals, industry combination as compared to the first half of 2021. So, regarding retail price that you have mentioned, so we do have increase our promotional assets in the third quarter are trying to drive our retail sales and reduce inventory pressure of our value chain.  And we have also seen that given the third quarter decline, in general consumer spending in China, many other companies similarly incremental subtleties or other sales incentives. For the overall magnitude of our subsidies are promotional efforts is relatively insignificant compared to other consumer goods Company in China. And we have started already reducing this further. So, going forward, we will continue to monitor our inventory level, together with user demand and adjust our promotional efforts promptly, to maintain reasonable retail price for our end-users. So, regarding your second question about the single-store sales and also how you mentioned healthy as the indicator.  So indeed, single store sales together with their profitability and every operating metrics, has been a really core focus in our day-to-day operations. As we also aware of the industry-wide  in retail sales, starting in the second half of 2021. But however, we also see that's been a recovery for many of our stores in recent months. As our stores are operating in a wide variety of location, some of them is in shopping malls, and some of them is on the streets. And they also place different working environments. We believe each star situation is very unique. So indeed, the entire thing will not have a healthy parameter for single as far south as we look at it one-by-one.  So, for a brand at e-vapor Company, we have been devoting resources and tools to update star owners and sales personnel in their data operations, including providing branding materials, POSM, training resources, digital hightation tools, and enhanced star site selection assistance. Indeed, for this quarter, we have also launched several new products and also upgraded our membership system to drive user engagement and retention better. So, with these initiatives, we believe we can, and we will continue to drive single store sales as we . Thank you very much.

So, could you share with us more color on the recovery in terms of the single store sales? And what is the store count as for now, and what is our target for the year end.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Jung with X CICC, please go ahead.
Jung Hao : Hi, good management and pay hardly XCICC. I have one question, is what is the outlook for  development and the nicotine limit of 2%. Thank you very much.
Sam Tsang : Thanks very much, Jung Hao. So, I believe, you are actually referring to the  drop in the current cigarettes, product spenders. So indeed, as a U.S. registered China Company, we have been long been aware of product requirements globally, including in the European Union and also the initial draft of National process vendors. Looking at the well-developed markets penetration, we believe lowering nicotine concentration will affect some user  satisfaction.  However, most of the  could still satisfy with special nicotine content or limits in the long run. Both from the perspective of product developments, our technology developments, we have picked up process rate up to low nicotine concentration, better satisfaction since 2019. And we do have the pinnacle know-how and part of research. So currently, as you may know, most of our cartridge nicotine concentration is 3%. If such national standards become effective, we'll straight fully comply with other requirements listed on the National Product Standards, including on nicotine contents. Thank very much.
