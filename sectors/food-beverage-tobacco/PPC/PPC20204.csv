At the company's request, this call is being recorded. Please note that the slides reference during today's call are available for download from the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.pilgrims.com. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.
Dunham Winoto: Thanks, Grant. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today as we review our operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and year-end of December 27, 2020. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release providing an overview of our financial performance for the quarter and for the year, including a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures we may discuss. A copy of the release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website, along with the slides we will reference during this call. These items have also been filed as 8-Ks and are available online at www.sec.gov. Presenting to you today are Fabio Sandri, President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Waldbusser, Head of Commodity Risk Management. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone of our safe harbor disclaimer. Today's call may contain certain forward-looking statements that represent our outlook and current expectations as of the day of this release. Other additional factors not anticipated by management may cause actual results to differ material from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Further information concerning those factors has been provided in today's press release, our 10-K, and our regular filings with the SEC. I'd now like to turn the call over to Fabio Sandri.
Fabio Sandri: Thank you, Dunham. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the full year 2020, we reported net revenues of $12.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $788 million or a 6.5% margin and an adjusted EPS of $1.02. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported net revenues of $3.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $205 million or a 6.6% margin, 27% higher than a year ago and an adjusted EPS of $0.25. Last year presented one of the most significant operating challenges across many industries here in US and globally. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our global teams for their continued commitment, dedication, and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and healthy, while maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging time. I could not be more proud of our team as they have continued to come together to support one another, our customers, and consumers. Safety is a condition at Pilgrim's and our team members responded admirably to the unprecedented conditions, supplying products to our customers. We are continuously adapting our global operations to the challenging channel demand while adjusting our operations to be able to maintain the operations at all of our plants and minimize any significant disruptions due to labor and health issues. We remain diligent in implementing precautionary proactive steps to better safeguard the wellness and health of each team member, while fulfilling our essential business duty as a food producer to consumers in every region where we operate.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Ben Theurer: Fabio, just to follow-up on the US and just to understand a little bit the commentary. So, if we take a look at the roughly $58 million operating income loss and we adjust that with the $75 million settlement, that would bring us just in the US segment a little less than $20 million in operating income, which compared to the revenues of a little less than $1.8 billion is literally just not even a 1% operating income margin. So just to understand a little bit, what else within the quarter that might have impacted the US margin, just to come in a little shy of 1%? Is it the $30 million you've just mentioned with bonus accruals and legal accruals that's also in there, so we should consider that as well or what is it would basically kind of derailed a little bit versus maybe what expectations were or consensus was and I myself was trying to come out initially. Thank you.
Fabio Sandri: Sure. Thanks, Ben. Compared to the same quarter last year, we have 1.1% lower volumes, which is in line with the industry. Our plant cost was $14 million higher due to the COVID costs, and our mix was not as efficient as it was due to the inefficiencies caused by the lower availability of labor given the increase in COVID cases in the communities we were inserted during November and December. To your point, we also recognized $30 million in one-offs and the legal costs and our accrual on bonus, which is a fundamental step in recognizing the great commitment of our team members to maintain the safety of our team members and our operations.
Ben Theurer: Okay, perfect. And, just to get a little bit, I mean obviously the environment right now, grain cost is obviously going to be a challenge, but you've nicely elaborated on what you can do and how you're working in between the different bird sizes. Could you talk a little bit about what you're trying to do on the pricing side and you're showing it at least in the commodity side, I mean clearly prices were - the first few weeks of January were - look very promising and higher levels than in prior years, but is that enough to offset the grain cost and what else can you do in order to keep profitability in check?
Fabio Sandri: Sure, thank you, Ben. First, I think we will always refer to our portfolio, right. We are well diversified in terms of exposure to commodity markets and with our production in more stable segments like small bird and the case-ready. Also every year during our budgets and during our management methods, we identify opportunities for improving in our operations. This year, we identified another $100 million in operational improvements that we will pursue, and all of our team members already detailed plans on how to capture, so we are always looking for operational improvements to be more productive and also to support our key customer growth. In terms of pricing, on the commodity segments, we are seeing that the current turn out is rising and not only for the big bird and boneless breast, but also across all meat types. Despite this increase, chicken continues to be the most affordable and available protein, and we are seeing an increase in pricing and reduction in availability of the competing proteins, especially beef. So what's happening in the boneless breast category is that we're seeing some strong demand, which is outpacing 2020 by more than 9% this year starting in January. 
Ben Theurer: Just boneless, correct?
Fabio Sandri: Just boneless.
Ben Theurer: Just boneless breast?
Fabio Sandri: Just boneless breast.
Ben Theurer: Okay.
Fabio Sandri: And then that combined, medium and jumbo production was only 1% up, which is creating a good environment for pricing. But it's not only on the boneless what we are seeing the increase, wings continued to set new highs as the foodservice demand is very well supported by the delivery and the takeout and retail remained strong. The tenders has also been very strong across all segments similar to wings because of the delivery and takeout. And I think the - very important too, we're seeing a very strong increase in the back half pricing, which is having some lower supply inventory of dark  meat and a weaker US dollar and with the strong oil pricing, it's making some of the oil-dependent countries to come back and do some significant buying from the US. So we're seeing strengthening in all meat types on the commodity segment. Combined to that in the other segments, we not only have a portfolio of products, we also have a portfolio of contracts. So, some of our products are grain related, some of our products are cost plus with grain and other inputs as well, and when we have the contract negotiations with our key customers, we will also discuss the increase in prices due to the increases in the feed.
Ben Theurer: Okay. Perfect. And then just one quick one if I might squeeze it in. What are you seeing in Mexico in terms of supply coming in? We know there's usually, when profitability is as high as it was over the last two quarters, very attractive for some of the more independent guys coming in, but because of the critical COVID situation in Mexico, some of the live markets is still not as accessible. So what are you seeing, are you seeing like more production coming in or would you expect profitability to stay in the more attractive levels as what we have seen over the last two quarters?
Fabio Sandri: Yes, Mexico is, like I mentioned in every, I think every call, right, quarter-over-quarter performance can be very volatile in Mexico given the market conditions, but Mexico has been very consistent on a year-over-year basis, and 2020 was no different, right. We saw extreme volatility during the quarters, but we finished the year in line with the previous year. In terms of supply/demand, I think we reached a level that is a good level of supply and demand. I think the high price of feed is preventing some marginal players, especially the live market to come to market because they buy just the feed comfortably, right. They don't have the very well-diversified portfolio that we have with prepared foods and all segments, and also they don't have the sophisticated hedging and the risk management that we have in both in US, Mexico, and Europe. So they are scared by the increase in the feed prices, which is preventing those marginal players to come in, which is creating an environment of adequate supply and demand there. We expect that to continue. The big question for Mexico is how the economy is going to evolve, especially during the second semester, different than US There was not a lot of governmental help and we saw the big challenge they had in the first semester of 2020. We expect that the economy to start to improve, and as the trade between US and Mexico started to increase as well with the recovery of the US economy, that Mexican economy will follow suit, and we expect that this available income will flow to the increase in the protein consumption in Mexico as we expect in the long run. And once again, the team in Mexico is the true differentiation. They have operational excellence, and we continue to over perform against our competitors.
Ben Theurer: Okay. Perfect. I'll leave it here. Thank you very much, Fabio. Talk to you later.
Fabio Sandri: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ken Zaslow who is with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
KenZaslow: Just my first question is, how does this quarter at all forecast or predict what's going to happen for the rest of the year? Is this a representative quarter in terms of US chicken, is this a transitional quarter, how do you define this quarter in terms of how you think about the chicken outlook in light of the higher feed costs and the higher chicken prices, how does this quarter really represent the future?
Fabio Sandri: Yes, thanks, Ken. As we always say, Q4 is never the strongest quarter for chicken, right. We have the Thanksgiving and year end events that it typically favor other types of proteins like hams and turkey. So Q4 is never the strongest for chicken. And what we always see is a rebound from Q4 starting in Q1, with much bigger consumption in the retail, with a lot of features on the retail and also in the foodservice. I think 2021 has started different than all the years because of the continuation of the pandemic. So we are seeing very strong retail while foodservice has not pickup yet. As what we are expecting for 2021, in January, production is down 1.3% and the USDAs outlook gives the forecast of 0.7% growth in 2021 in chicken production. We think that this will mostly come from increased number of heads as we've seen in the small bird category, which saw the most consistent headcount reductions in 2020, rebounding with the return of foodservice later this year. So what we are expecting for 2021 is, as the availability of chicken will continue to be constrained, the demand will continue to increase given the return of the foodservice. As I was talking on the prior question, I think there is the unknown of the increase in the grain cost and Joe can talk a little bit about our strategy in terms of hedging, but also the prospects for the new crop. And we have a multitude of contracts and we believe that despite this increase, we see that increase in the cut out and the cost initiatives that we are taking, and the increase is that we can have with our key customers that we can count on that and have 2021, which is going to be much better than 2020.
Ken Zaslow: I appreciate it. Thank you guys very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu who is with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Pooran Sharma: This is actually Pooran on for Ben. Just wanted to ask, how are you doing achieving targeted live weights and do you think you live weights could be lower year-over-year given operational challenges that you saw last year.
Fabio Sandri: Yes, thanks for the question. Well, the overall live weight depends a lot on the portfolio that you're running, right. For Pilgrim's, we are achieving the expected live weights, but our overall live weight will probably go lower because we are converting one of our plants from the big bird segment, which is the commodity segment to small bird segment. That will reduce the - although we're going to increase a little bit the number of heads, we're going to reduce the overall size. So in average, Pilgrim's will probably reduce a little its overall size. I think - and that is somewhat true to the entire industry as well. In 2020, what we saw was the reduction and especially on the small bird category. So as that small bird category comes back in 2021 with the easening  of the travel restrictions and the return of the foodservice, we may see an average bird weight to go down, although we're going to see a little bit increase in heads. We have not seen any issues in our live weight and we expect that to continue with the difference of the portfolio.
Pooran Sharma: Okay, thanks. And then as far as the Tulip business, I wanted to ask about something I read on the press release. We're thinking about Tulip being on track to achieve performance competitive with leading companies in the next few years. I just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more detail on that. Is that a firm timeline? Is there any upside? Could you get there any sooner? If we could just get your take on that.
Fabio Sandri: Sure. I think with all other acquisitions that we did, which always created a lot of value through the synergies and the integration, especially on the changing of our methodology of opening the gaps or identify all the opportunities, and then closing the gaps with the methodology that we use. So in prior acquisitions, we have always over achieved, and what we expect for Tulip is no different. So what we mentioned when we did the acquisition was that we are going to enhance our key customer initiatives and we did that. As I mentioned, we increased more than 14% sales with the key customers, which are more profitable for us and also help our key customers to grow. Also in the operational achievements, we identified more than £20 million a year in operational improvements in Tulip, which is now Pilgrim's UK, and we expect in the two-year timeframe to achieve profitability close to the leading companies in Europe. I think as we always say, our vision is to become the best and most respected, and that is in line with that vision.
Pooran Sharma: Yes. I appreciate the answers, Fabio. I'll jump back in the queue.
Fabio Sandri: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Piken who is with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Piken: Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into - I know you said you moved one of your plants operationally from big birds over to other segments, more fast food. If you could give an update on your mix, I know historically you've said it's roughly one-third big bird, one-third tray pack, kind of one-third small bird, if you could give an update kind of on how your relative mix between the segments is and what percentage of your business maybe is more on a cost plus or grain-based type contracts versus just spot margins, that would be helpful. Thanks.
Fabio Sandri: Yes. Thank you. That change will not modify significantly the portfolio that we have. It's a relatively small plant, but we will continue to be well balanced. I think we will have now close to 35% on the small bird category, which is a little bit more than the other segments, but we will still be well balanced. In terms of contracts, like we mentioned, we have a very diversified type of contracts. Most of our contracts are market-based or contract-based, meaning we can negotiate prices because they are contracts with key customers, but we have close to 20% of our contracts in cost plus or grain-based base.
Michael Piken: Great. That's really, really helpful. And then I guess just shifting over a little bit, I know you talked about gradual kind of recovery in foodservice this year. I mean are you starting to see signs from some of the bigger distributors that they are looking to take more product or are they kind of sniffing around or I guess maybe are you starting to see orders materialize or is it more just inquiries at this point? And after, would you be thinking about when that demand might start to show up in some of the numbers?
Fabio Sandri: Yes, we're receiving more and more inquiries about it. I think everybody is looking at the overall protein category in US, and what the distributors and also the food service operators are looking is on the total availability of protein. So when you look at the USDA numbers, beef availability will be flat to a little bit down for 2021 compared to 2020, and pork will also reduce the increase that they had last year to close to 1.5% increase. Chicken is no different. USDA is expecting less than 1% increase. So the overall protein category in US is going to grow less than 1%, and that is before we see the huge increase in exports that we are seeing in January. If that continues throughout the year, we're going to see a lower availability of overall protein in US And then the foodservice operator and also the distributors are looking for the best opportunities that they have, and chicken continue to be the best opportunity. I think contributing to that is also what people are referring to the chicken sandwich wars. We are seeing that the growth of the chicken sandwich continues to have this halo effect on the chicken on foodservice and we expect chicken to be heavily promoted in the QSRs, which represents a large portion of our overall chicken service.
Operator: Our next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Peter Galbo: Fabio, maybe to ask like a higher-level question, as we think about total protein availability in the landscape, right. Chicken at least as we've seen is probably more reliant than beef or pork in terms of needing foodservice recovery to come back, in terms of the exposure of the industry. And I just wanted to see if that premise was fair or that's kind of how you look at it as well internally, but then also, as we think about your ability to realize pricing in 2021 and going forward, the need for foodservice recovery and as we look at those commodity chicken prices that we have access to, how much of that you would typically realize in your results? And I know there's a lot there, but maybe I'll leave it there, and then I have a follow-up.
Fabio Sandri: Thank you, Peter. And once again I go back to our portfolio, right. We have proven that our portfolio can be resilient on the downward on the market, because we have the categories of the small bird and the case ready, which holds price much better than the commodity segment during downturns, but we also have the exposure to do commodity segment. So like I mentioned, we are well balanced. So we have the exposure to the commodity segment. So when the commodity segments are really strong, we can benefit from that with direct and immediate pricing. On the negotiations with key customers, of course, we take into consideration a lot of things, right. We take into consideration freight increases, we take into consideration the grain increases, and we also look into the forward grain pricing. It's not only the immediate price on the grain but we look into the forward price of grain. And that will take place in the negotiations that we have, and we have the exposure to the grain contract related pricing where we will have that. There is some delays on the pricing increases because of the duration of the contracts but we will benefit from that in the future. I think most of all, it is about the resilience of this portfolio and our ability to pass through the prices on the grain with our contract negotiations. I think the overall profitability of the chicken industry will also depend on the supply and demand balance. I think as we have mentioned, the industry is expected to grow less than 1% during this year and that is the growth in production. I think again we are seeing a big spike in the exports, which may signify reduction in domestic availability of meat, but despite all that, chicken continues to be of a great value to both foodservice and retail.
Peter Galbo: Okay. Now that's helpful. And maybe just two other quick one. One on interest expense, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly, at $120 million and the second question on Europe, I think you've outlined that there are some operational improvements you've made in 2020 to improve profitability, maybe being offset by potentially lower exports after a very strong export year into 2021. So as we just think about profitability in Europe, is it kind of the case that 2021 should be a similar type year or at least as how you're planning for today. Thanks very much.
Fabio Sandri: Sure. In terms of the interest expense is, yes $120 million, of course, we have the 2025 bonds that are callable and going to be callable during 2021. So as we are seeing a very positive market, so we believe that we will refinance that, and if we refinance, of course this interest expense is going to be lower, as we are seeing very low interest in the market right now, compared to that 2025 bond that pay 5.75. I think that will be a great - an important position for us to reduce our interest expense and produce even more cash flow that we can invest in our business. In terms of the Europe, I think every year we see operational improvements, we see the benefits of the integration, and in Europe, we are more retail-oriented, so we saw OK market this year and the foodservice was much weaker, but the retail continues to be strong and we expect that to continue in 2021. We expected our retail business to continue to improve during 2021, we talk about growing with key customers, which reduces their cost as well as our cost, so improves our efficiency. So we are expecting 2021 with better margins in Europe.
Operator: Our next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Adam Samuelson: I guess my main question just quickly on the Prepared Foods business as we think about kind of that's in 2021 in the K. I think you gave utilization for the Prepared Foods businesses around the world at 68%, but I mean, the US business, I know it's been struggling with utilization and profitability for a while. Is that really just dependent on foodservice, institutional foodservice specifically in the US getting better or have some of the actions you've taken around expanding some of those retail items under the Just BARE brand, kind of putting on a better path there without foodservice, really just trying to think what the profitability of that component? And then I have a second quick follow-up.
Fabio Sandri: Sure. Thanks, Adam. Yes, our service or our prepared business have a strong position in the foodservice. We have the Pierce brand, which is very strong in the foodservice category, and we also have a very big operation for the school lunch. So I think with the closing of the schools and with the downturn on the foodservice especially what we talk about is the street business right that is down close to 20%. Overall foodservice is down 9%, but because QSRs are up close to 8%, but the street business or the foodservice restaurants is now close to 25%, so I think that impacted our business. We were able to counter that with a significant increase in our retail business, especially with Just BARE brand, but it's also with the Pilgrim's brand where we are gaining distribution throughout the year. So there was a ramp up on that to the point that we are almost full in our capacity of fully cooked products as of today. I think what we are expecting is the rebound and the return of the schools with more mobility in the foodservice, which will significantly increase for the profitability and the capacity utilization of our prepared food operation. But overall, we have increased the gross margin with the more - I think with the better bottom line on the retail business, especially on the branded side.
Adam Samuelson: Okay, great. And then my follow-up just on the legal settlement, I just want to make sure clear that that's only for the announced settlement with the Direct Purchaser Class. And so I looked at one of your competitors this morning, they settled with all the classes and accrued for the opt-out plaintiff. So is that reasonable to think that there could be some additional accruals over the course of 2021 and kind of concurrent with that, lower legal expenses in 2021 of profitability maybe move through the work, the biggest parts of those litigation?
Fabio Sandri: Yes. As we initially had some increased legal expenses in Q4 that impacted US, and I think more important than that Adam is that, we are committed to the strongest level where all aspects of our ESG policies is the environmental, social and the governance. We're very proud of the commitments on our sustainability report and our recent investments in our Hometown Strong Program, we are investing more than $20 million in projects that have a lasting impact in our communities for generations to come. We still have only $5 million that we are convinced was only for the direct purchases.
Adam Samuelson: Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from your Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Rebecca Scheuneman: Good morning, and thanks for fitting me in. So first, as we look at 2021, there is obviously a lot of different puts and takes compared to 2020. We have higher grain prices, we also have a recovery in foodservice. And just kind of at a high level, I'm just kind of wondering how margins in 2021 are going to look compared to 2020. I believe you said that it should be higher directionally, I'm not sure if you're referring to each region or was that just the US.
Fabio Sandri: Yes. Thank you. I think we just start talking a little bit about the way we treat our hedging policy or risk management on terms of mitigating the grain increases for 2021. I think Joe can help us with some of our policies and how we see this risk management.
Joe Waldbusser: Thank you for the question, Rebecca. Obviously, we've seen higher corn and soy prices really since this late last summer, early last fall and it's been a combination of a few things, it's been the reduced supply, it's been bigger than expected demand for US exports maybe in China. So we do see higher risk today to both the corn and soybean supplies out of the US, probably alluded to the increased acres coming from higher prices generating more incentive for the farmers. We expect somewhere around a 9 million increase in acres of corn and soybeans next year, which should help those supplies in the fall. Now that being said, obviously with the higher risk in the balance sheets for corn and soy, we've said on our calls previously, we have an adaptive risk policy and it's measured against the risk we see in the market and we have that position on today.
Fabio Sandri: We managed the risk on the cost side. Like I mentioned have plans in place to capture the operational opportunities like we do every year and we are very focused on this operational excellence and all of our teams pay a lot of attention on improving our operations, which helps our customers and helps our bottom-line. And at the end, we also mitigate the increase in the grain prices, with our portfolio of products and contracts. So, we have the cost plus and the grains-based contrasts that help us mitigate that and also, we have the customer relationships, where we share the discussion about pricing, to help them being competitive, but also help the company to continue to grow and support their further growth. And what we are seeing on the commodity segments is a great recovery in terms of pricing with the very positive supply demand and on the international markets, when we are seeing as a great pool for US products, which are very competitive in the international markets. We were seeing the issues with the grain that we are mitigating with our policies and we are mitigating those price increases through our portfolio of products as well.
Rebecca Scheuneman: Great. That's good to hear. And then for my last question, I'm just wondering if you could provide a little update on staffing at the plant, if you're still experiencing a lot of absenteeism or if plants are staffed adequately, and related to that, if you expect wage inflation in the coming year? Thank you.
Fabio Sandri: Yes sure, Rebecca. Yes, we saw in November and December as a consequence of the increase in number of cases in the United States, that the plants starting to have more staffing issue. I think it is regional or local. We have 33 plants across the United States and many others throughout the world and it's very local. So it was not anything widespread. And even with the wage increases, the approach that we have is always to be very specific to the local communities and identify the competitiveness of our regions in the local communities where we are inserted. So we are seeing some staffing challenges, especially during Q4. They are improving now and we expect those as the vaccination continues, and we see as essential workers being vaccinated. We are seeing a reduction on that and we expect all of our plants to be fully staffed during Q2.
Rebecca Scheuneman: Great, thank you so much.
Operator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Fabio Sandri for any closing remarks.
Fabio Sandri: Thank you all. We would like to reiterate our continued commitment to our valued team members to provide them with a safe and healthy work environment, while supporting our duty to maintain food production and supply to customers. We're looking forward to 2021 and expect better results in spite of volatility. Our diverse portfolio of differentiated products tailored to support our key customer strategy in conjunction with our broad geographic footprint will continue to generate consistent performance and minimize margin volatility in challenging market conditions relative to competitors. We will continue to seek new growth potential, both organically and through acquisitions, and offering even more differentiated products within our business to support key customer needs by cultivating a culture of constant innovation. We would like to thank everyone in the business family, including our family farm partners, suppliers and our customers, who make our business possible. As always, we appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
