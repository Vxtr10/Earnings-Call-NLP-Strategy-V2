Overall, volume was 2% higher than last year’s fourth quarter. Worldwide pricing increased $0.06 per box to $13.76.

Gross profit increased to $49 million compared with $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Operator, we can now turn the call over for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And I just got a question from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Athlos Research. Your line is open.
Jonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks very much for the time.
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: Thank you, Jonathan for being with us.
Jonathan Feeney: Great quarter, so I guess looking at - coming into this quarter, I have to say you with a little surprise, I mean if I walked one on in the world, you cut your supply introductions maybe some concern on the Middle East, you have currency headwinds, I mean I guess if you could - just focus on those two, the sort of any disrupt - potential disruption in the Middle East and your currently exposure, I would think vulnerable for those would have been an impact on that corner, it doesn’t seem like they were. Could you kind of give me an update on that?
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: But actually there were disruption and I mean the least of course from markets or internally [ph], but we still been able to supply that in a consistent way. We had other issues where we have other supply during the early part of the quarter which affected our prices. The results could have been a lot better have not been oversupply in the beginning of the quarter. But - if you look at the general picture, I think our business has, I mean we have some cure that we know exactly where to allocate the volumes were we have so much diversified in our product lines and so much new customers in different parts of the world which really takes off - you know take off the risks of the perishable business as we always knew it. So I think the major part of why you see a very good quarter in terms of compared to last year, we could have done a better quarter as a matter of fact. But it’s because of all of work and focus during the last few years on diversification and introducing new products and getting into new areas around the world.
Jonathan Feeney: Can you give me a rough sense of how much, what percent of sales and profitability listed now?
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: Richard?
Richard Contreras: I can. For the year - please give one second, Jon. About 15%.
Jonathan Feeney: Sales and profit you said.
Richard Contreras: Of sales.
Jonathan Feeney: Of sales. Can you give me a sense what that, is a profit, is it a profitable for index.
Richard Contreras: We don’t disclose the profit by region, yeah I am sorry.
Jonathan Feeney: Okay. Thanks guys [ph] for trying.
Richard Contreras: It is profitable business.
Jonathan Feeney: Okay.
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: It’s not - the least you know we have expanded in many countries, in Europe, in Asia so the Middle East as well as North America you know we have increased our business significantly in North America in the fruit through new customers even new channels. And so its spread actually across the both, it’s not in one region as such.
Jonathan Feeney: Sure. For sure now that the pineapple business clearly gave you some strong results and if you are feeling that and it’s probably others are as well, just going to lead to like what’s you outlook for that your profit over the course of 2015, it shouldn’t be the kind of conditions where there will be more supply or more aggressive pricing coming out.
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: No, I think as the consistent business, over the years, we have seen the pineapple begin the major market share that you know I mean as first month and we keep that going forward. So and we are expanding our production in Costa Rica and other parts of the world. So we’ve considered that this would be consistent going forward.
Jonathan Feeney: Now when you look at - something I noticed is as few days, if you look at particularly strong results here, there is now fail on is management level failing, I know you still pertained in may huge taken the company but is this point of like a multiyear program or can you comment on your particularly given the coincidence with the company buying back stock, was it for that reason now is a good time for some managers have had stock for a while so where it go. I just kind of want to understand maybe what’s behind that and if or if it’s random?
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: As you speak, before myself I have [indiscernible] being there for some time. And most of this stock auction that I sold during the last several months. Actually are expiring in a couple of months. So either I had to sell them or to just for feed them, so. Nothing really out of ordinary here, I mean most of the employees have also probably more or less have been in the same situation. So it’s just a normal way I guess, nothing out of the ordinary here.
Richard Contreras: Our all other sales you’ve seen Jonathan are result of 10b5 plans. We have a window period that was not open. So of the sales you’ve seen, may employees are previously entered into 10b5 plan.
Jonathan Feeney: That’s helpful. Thank you very much. And looking at, I mean you take about the diversification Mohammad being the region for the part - this quarter I mean, does that mean looking forward, I mean these were much - I mean these were much better number than I would expect. Do you feel that kind of momentum is continuing into 2015?
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: Yes, I mean as you see, total expenditure was almost 150 million in 2014 and we expect another 200 million in 2015. And that gives you an idea what we are doing, I mean that money is going into FX which are proactive FX I mean be as an agriculture, be in agro industry and so on. So all this really I mean - we would see a bit of year or two from now but we are spending a lot of money into new projects and new better education [ph] program.
Jonathan Feeney: Do you - I mean - I guess last question for Richard and maybe I’ll take a follow-up on, ask specifically before but you’ve got some three country that are significant to you, the ruble again on the euro, was there an impact on the quarter from the depreciation of any those three and do you expect that to be interact to 2015? And as part of that do you hedge, I’ve never seen that you are hedging that exposure but I mean are you hedging that exposure now?
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: In the euro, yes, we do hedge that. We’ve always hedge that…
Jonathan Feeney: The ruble on the yen.
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: The yen, we do, the ruble we do not, it’s a small, relatively small business, very small for us, it’s in its rampancy, I mean we are there, we just recently started there. On the - and you did see an impact in the quarter because if you look at that almost $5 million other expense below gross profit, that’s almost all FX loss.
Jonathan Feeney: I see, okay. And you show up, it was like - is that going to be major headwinds in 2015 from you are hedged right now?
Richard Contreras: And by the way, Jon, you know some of those market when we are selling bananas, we do sell in dollars. So we’re not…
Jonathan Feeney: I see.
Richard Contreras: Yes. I am sorry what was your last question?
Jonathan Feeney: Would you expected to be from where you are right now, where you project right now, would you expect just those two particularly, I know there were able to be a headwind, the yen anyway to be a significant headwind in 2015?
Richard Contreras: Yes, the yen and euro could be headwinds in 2015.
Jonathan Feeney: Got you. Okay, well thanks very much for your time.
Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh: Thank you.
Richard Contreras: Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And it looks all the questions for today, so I’d like to turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.
