Norman Snyder: 4:45 Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. 2021 was another year of solid growth and execution. We faced many obstacles with our supply chain and logistics, but we persevered. I would also like to note that several improvements we made in 2020 and 2021 offset many of the supply chain impediments that we encountered last year, lessening the potential impact. We are continuing to strategically reduce the cost of our products to recover the margin growth we experienced during 2020. 5:21 We had two primary goals last year to drive our growth, distribution, expansion and brand launches through innovation, with an emphasis on new larger and faster growing categories. Regarding distribution, we increased our retail coverage footprint by 10% from the prior year with Reed’s products sold in over 45,000 retail locations nationwide. Specifically, this increase was driven by ACV growth or all comedy volume a measure of distribution based on total store sales. That was a 5% over last year, while velocity increased by 11% for the 52 weeks ending December 26, 2021. The same measures increased even further as ACV grew 14% and velocity was up 5% in the latest four week period, according to IRI MULO scan data. 6:11 During the year, we continue to build out our direct store distribution or DST (ph) network by adding 30 new distributors in Florida, Texas, Ohio, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. Overall case volume to our DST network increased 60% during 2021. We plan to continue to augment our DST network during 2022 and are rapidly closing existing whitespace. 6:39 Let's turn to our second goal for last year, brand launches. When I joined Reed’s in 2019, it was clear that we had significant brand heritage and brand equity. However, the majority of sales were driven by ginger beer, which in our opinion, is too narrow of a category for such a strong brand. While we have not seen any market share, we are critically focused on innovation to meet our goals within our established timeframe. Shortly thereafter, we launched our first ginger ale, which stands in a category 10 times the size of ginger beer. And 2021, we are proud to say that ginger ale sales were up 150% year-over-year in a significantly larger category with ACV increasing 102% and velocity up 34%. It is still early for reach ginger ale, and we are intently focused on further growing velocity and our distribution network to keep the momentum going. 7:35 We also soft launched our ginger ale mocktails and securing a 1,000 doors last year, which has increased to 5,000 doors so far in 2022 with multiple new flavor offerings in our portfolio. We look forward to bolstering ginger ale mocktail distribution with the addition of drug and convenience stores. Another notable category expansion was our entrance into the ready to drink or RTD and Flavored Malt Beverage or FMB category in 2020. The RTD and FMB category have the fastest great verticals in the beverage industry, and already five times the size of ginger ale. 8:09 Our first product launch was our Reed’s Classic Mule in 2020 and in 2021, we reacquired the distribution rights. And the RTD segment of our business, we initially converted 42 distributors in the eastern half of the United States and are in the process of converting an additional 10 in the east and are adding 12 in the West Coast. We anticipate increasing doors that carry our alcohol lines by approximately tenfold during 2022 by leveraging our DST network which we will discuss later in the call along with our upcoming launch of our ginger ale. 8:44 Overall, we are incredibly pleased with our sales execution and brand launches in 2021. On the other hand, we did have our share of challenges with respect to the size of supply chain. As seen across the industry, we face significantly higher costs from ingredients, packaging, labels, bottles, and cans, towing fees, ocean freight, essentially everything, not one category was left on affected. And while the broader macro-environment was calling for 7% to 8% inflation, we were easily seen triple that and in some cases multiples higher. All that said we needed to continue to implement the plan we established to navigate these choppy waters. 9:22 Our first initiative was to reduce transportation and warehouse costs, as we have less control over the cost of ingredients and other product inputs. For product transportation, we prioritize shipping through our network and eliminated out of network shipments, while also focusing on direct shipments to eliminate multiple touch points, and much more disciplined approach. For packaging, we have organically shifted to selling a greater mix of cans versus bottles, as demonstrated by our recent innovation. Not only is the aluminium cheaper than glass, but there's far less breakage less overall weight and the packaging is more compact, all of which enables us to ship more units per truck. We have already secured our entire can supply for 2020. 10:03 To further offset the increased supply chain costs and bottlenecks. We leaned in on formula optimization, increasing lead time for key ingredients, purchasing efficiencies for labels, and corrugate and staffing improvements. We are now just beginning to realize the benefits of these various initiatives. Our margins are up considerably in Q1 relative to Q4 (ph), and we expect further improvements going forward if we still have additional work left to do with our supply chain initiatives, including further purchasing deficiencies in formula optimization, as well as a restructure of our three PL partnerships and distribution agreements. 10:39 We have also recently increased pricing across our portfolio of products and approximately 8% increase across the board, which should provide a 4% to 5% margin benefit in 2022 by the time it flows through the network. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we plan to emphasize many of the same growth and cost savings initiatives we started during 2021. We plan to expand distribution of ginger ale to more doors and consumers across the US. 11:07 In addition, we are debuting our hard ginger ale in Q2 and expand our distribution of Classic Mule. As I mentioned earlier, we took over the distribution from full sale in 2021 and are now registered are waiting on -- waiting on executed distribution contracts in close to every state across the country. We will now fully control the sales and marketing process and this change in distribution ownership enables us to recognize gross revenue as opposed to a royalty stream going forward. 11:37 In our DST network, we plan to increase distribution to 10,000 plus doors in 2022. A 10x increase from 2021 as I referenced earlier. In our Virgil line, we are launching our new sleek 12 ounce zero sugar cans next month in sprouts. Virgil's grew double digits last year and is outpacing the market growth for zero sugar, it remains a staple in our portfolio of products because it accounts for roughly 45% of net sales and one of our more profitable categories given the lower cost of ingredients and packaging. 12:08 And of course we plan to continue being one of the category leaders in ginger beer and expect to continue outpacing overall market growth going forward. With all these initiatives in place we expect our growth for the year to be backloaded beginning in Q2 and accelerating in Q3 and Q4. Our order volumes are up 20% Q1; however, early in the quarter, we contended with supply chain issues that carried over from last year, which have since been resolved. On our cost savings, we can still tighten up production related waste and achieve, rebate volumes both of which will benefit gross margins over the course of the year and should contribute to getting us back to the 30% level on a full year basis. 12:50 With that I will pass the call to Tom to walk through our financial results before returning for closing remarks.
Tom Spisak: 12:57 Thanks, Norm. Jumping right into our results, all variances referenced are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Net revenue for Q4 was up 20% to $12.8 million driven by continued strong demand across our portfolio products. As Norm mentioned, gross margins were down from 32.7% to 20.4% due to an increase in supply chain costs. We expect gross margins to improve in Q1 and thereafter as we progress through the year. Delivery and handling fees in Q4 increased to $3.1 million from $1.9 million driven by volume growth and increase fulfillment and freight costs. Delivery and handling costs were approximately 24% of net sales are $3.94 per case compared to 18% of net sales, or $2.99 per case in the year ago quarter. 13:57 Selling and marketing costs increased to $2.2 million, compared to $2.1 million as a percentage of revenue. Selling and marketing costs were 17% down three points from 2020. Our general and administrative expenses decreased year-on-year to $1.7 million from $2.1 million as we've been relentlessly focused on managing our overhead. 14:22 Operating loss during the quarter was $4.4 million or $0.05 per share compared to net loss of $2.7 million or $0.04 per share from the prior year's quarter. And modified EBITDA was $3.9 million loss, compared to a $2 million loss in the year ago quarter. Given the demonstrable cost increases across our supply chain including a 60% increase in delivery and handling. We are proud of the hard work our team has put in to mitigate and offset the operating losses where possible. 15:00 Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity. Cash used in operating activities was approximately $17.6 million for 2021, compared to $9.5 million in 2020, with the increase driven by greater net loss, and additional investment in inventory to mitigate supply chain bottlenecks. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $49,000 of cash and $109,000 available on a revolving line of credit. Total facility has a borrowing capacity of $13 million with $10.2 million loan balance. Subsequent to the year end, we closed a $5.4 million private placement with officers and directors of the company purchasing approximately $1.1 million of the security in the offering. 15:52 Looking to our outlook for the year, we remain committed to improving profitability in 2022. As we now have a solid handle on the supply chain and the rate of cost increases has decelerated. We expect to improve modified EBITDA in calendar 2022 compared to 2021 and also expect to deliver gross margins of approximately 30% on a full year basis. Lastly, we expect to continue delivering on the top line with net sales ranging between $59 million and $62 million in 2022, reflecting more than 20% growth at the midpoint. 16:29 I will now turn the call back to Norman for closing remarks.
Norman Snyder: 16:35 Thanks, Tom. I would like to thank the team at Reed's for their dedication and perseverance throughout this unfavorable economic environment. I'm optimistic that we have turned the corner from the macro challenges we faced in 2021. We now have the right people and systems in place having turned over nearly 50% of the management team and 100% of the finance and operations team since I joined Reed’s two years ago. Between the pandemic in 2020 and the supply chain and inflation in 2021, we have learned to adapt and respond to whatever the world throws at us. I firmly believe the best days for Reed’s are ahead. 17:10 Operator, we will now open the call for Q&A.
Operator: 17:17 We will now begin the question and answer session.  And the first question comes from Sean McGowan with ROTH capital, please go ahead.
Sean McGowan: 17:47 Hi, guys, thanks for taking call. A couple of questions. Norman, can you repeat, there's a lot I want to repeat, but just one thing on the ginger ale increase, I think you said it was over 100% but I didn't get the exact number?
Norman Snyder: 18:07 150%
Sean McGowan: 18:08 150% okay. 150, great. And, Tom, is this -- the level of interest that you see in the quarter that you're showing for the fourth quarter? Is that what we should expect kind of on an ongoing basis so or would you expect it to be higher over the -- over the next several quarters?
Tom Spisak: 18:30 When you say interest, you referring to sales interest?
Sean McGowan: 18:34 Interest expense.
Tom Spisak: 18:35 Interest expense. Yes I would say that's gonna be level with we've just switched to a new ABL provider. So I've expected to be, yes.
Sean McGowan: 18:46 Okay.
Tom Spisak: 18:47 In the neighborhood of that.
Sean McGowan: 18:50 And given the – the financing that you announced during the quarter, can you – can you help us with what the share count is like today, at the end of the last day of the first quarter, and what the average would wind up being for the first quarter?
Tom Spisak: 19:09 I can tell you the count is $112,842, but I don't have the average off the top of my head. I can work on that. And then back to the comments on that Norm made on price increases the 8% price increase, I think you said should provide a 4% to 5% margin benefit, I assume that's before the effects of any inflation, not on a net basis. You're not saying, you're expected gross margins to go up by 500 basis points.
Sean McGowan: 19:47 Now, that -- that includes after -- after inflation, what the impact on margin?
Tom Spisak: 19:53 So, so -- so we are going to see an increase. Okay. I just want to be clear on this. All right. Great. I'll probably have some others as little  I'll pass it on. Thanks.
Tom Spisak: 20:06 You're welcome.
Operator: 20:14 The next question comes from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Matt Bullock: 20:21 Hi, this is Matt on for Anthony. I was hoping you could talk about the reception thus far the Reed’s zero classic or Reed Zero Sugar Classic Mule at Costco and then if you could remind us what percent of revenue as of right now the ready to drink or mocktails make up of your revenue and what we can expect over the next few years as you kind of drive that store count up. Thanks.
Norman Snyder: 20:46 Well, right now, it's still fairly early, we took over the distribution footprint from full sale, we converted to a whole new distribution network outside of what they've done. So we're working on, they were basically, and I want to say a few changes like Whole Foods. They had some -- we had some sporadic Costco distribution, and I think sprouts and we’re able to assume those and then get into additional changes to our network. So it's really early right now. It's -- it's minimal. But we expect -- we expect it to be roughly, I want to say between 4% and 5%. And we're being real, real conservative, 4% to 5% of total revenue for 2022.
Matt Bullock: 21:53 Got it helpful. And then you've made a lot of progress, transitioning your distribution network over the DST. I'm curious if you can comment a little bit on the velocities you're seeing at the locations that are serviced by DST versus the rest of your network?
Norman Snyder: 22:08 Yes, it really, it's -- it differs by geographic, I'll say this, we just recently completed a real big promotion at Publix where we worked through our DST network. And we had like a seven times lift, which we're really happy with. Part of it obviously is showing them and the power of this brand and what it can -- what it can do when you get behind it, I think that was a great first start. And probably the first major promotion we've done to our DST -- our new DST network. So that spreads, obviously, and we can use those actual sales results and when we go into other DST distributors to create expectation, so we're real -- we're real pleased with the initial start.
Matt Bullock: 23:04 Understood, thanks. And then apologies if I missed this, but when did that 8% price increase across your portfolio take effect in store or has that yet to have?
Norman Snyder: 23:15 It's been submitted. The majority of retailers have accepted it. So we're looking at the latter part of – met the latter part of the second quarter.
Matt Bullock: 23:27 Got it. Thank you. I'll pass it on.
Operator: 23:38 Here is we have no further questions. So this concludes our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the conference back over to Norman Snyder for any closing remarks.
Norman Snyder: 23:51 Thank you. We thank everyone for joining and your continued support. We look forward to sharing our progress in a couple of months when we report our Q1 results. Everyone have a wonderful day. Thanks for joining us.
Operator: 24:14 The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect."
