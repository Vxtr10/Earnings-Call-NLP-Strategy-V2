Katherine Yao: I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Roy Yu, Chief Financial Officer of Pingtan Marine Enterprise.
Roy Yu: Thanks, Katherine. Good morning and welcome everyone. Today I will discuss Pingtan Marine's 2017 third quarter and nine months operation and financial results. As we previously disclosed Pingtan's financial results was still affected by the initial governments, our [indiscernible] and renewables so that the country's Ministry of Marinetime Affairs and Fisheries could combat illegal fishing and rectify ocean fishing order. In November 2015, the Indonesian government announced that the moratorium had concluded. As the government has not implemented new fishing policies and received the license renewal process we do not know when exactly licensing and renewable will start. The company has paying close attention to any new trends in fishing policy and has been actively inquiring new operation models. In September 2017, the company was informed that the fishing licenses of 13 vessels deployed to Indo-Pacific waters was suspended and the vessels were docked in the port that our Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of the Democratic Republic Timor-Leste. The [indiscernible] false statements were made during the licensing process and the vessel was simultaneously registered in Indonesia. The company disputes these allegations. The company's 140 vessels 12 are located in the Bay of Bengal in India, nine are located in international waters and 13 are located in the Indo-Pacific waters. Two fishing [ph] vessels finished renovation in October 2017 and will be deployed to international waters. The remaining vessels are temporarily not operating due to the important discussed above. Now I would like to move to financial results. For the third quarter of 2017 our sales volume were 1.54 million kg increased 234% from 0.46 million kg in the third quarter of 2016. Pingtan reports its revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2017 as $5.5 million increased 367% from $1.2 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly attributable to our business expansion resulting from our fishing vessels in operation. For the third quarter of 2017 gross loss was $1.3 million compared to gross loss of $12.3 million in the prior year period. The gross margin increased to minus 24% for three months ended September 30, 2017 from 153% minus in the same period in the prior year. The significant increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in our unit production cost of fish resulting from the increase in our harvest volume by deploying more fishing vessels into operation. Our selling expense mainly including shipping and handling fees, insurance, custom related charges, storage fees and other expenses. Our sales activities are conducted through direct selling our internal sales staff because of the strong demand for our products and services we do not have aggressively market and distribute our products. As a result our selling expenses has been relatively small as a percentage of revenue. For the third quarter 2017 selling expenses were $0.2 million compared to $0.1 million in the prior year period. For the three months ended September 30, 2017 our general and administrative expenses were $1 million compared to $0.7 million in the prior year period. Pingtan reported net income attributable to owners of the company of $6 million for the third quarter of 2017 or $0.08 per basic and diluted share increased 146.4% from net loss attributable to owners of the company of $12.8 million or minus $0.16 per basic and diluted share in the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 Pingtan's revenues were $46.8 million increased 533.7% from $7.4 million in the same period in 2016. Net income attributable to owners of the company for the nine months of 2017 was $24.8 million $0.31 per basic and diluted share increased 212% from net loss attributable to owners of the company of $22.2 million or minus $0.28 per basic and diluted share in the same period of 2016. On the balance sheet as of September 30, 2017 Pingtan's cash and cash equivalent were $22.3 million. Total assets were $218.8 million, total long term debt was $19.9 million and shareholder's equity was $140.2 million compared to $0.8 million, $226.5 million, $21.9 million and $139.7 million respectively at December 31, 2016. To conclude we will continue and be obligated to cooperate with the government authorities in hopes of accelerating implementation of new fishing policies in Indonesia and the investigation of our vessels by Timor-Leste. Meanwhile we remain focused on all aspects of business expansion to further celebrated [ph] by our industry position by expanding our fishing territories to increase production capacity and extend product categories to speed up the construction of our processing factory to enter the sea food deep processing market, and to further export e-commerce retail business model to reach directly to end customers, while addressing existing customers to avail new distribution channels across China.
