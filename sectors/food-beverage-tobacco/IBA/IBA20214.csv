Having a widespread footprint with participation in all the main channels in Mexico allow us to capitalize those conditions while improving our sales reaching double-digit sales growth for the full year. In terms of costs, high raw material prices in U.S. dollars represented one of the main challenges to overcome this. And 2021 had a negative impact across our business lines. On the average for the year, we observed grain around 42% higher than 2020 levels, while soybean meal increased around 28% versus the average of 2020 as well.

And I will turn the call back to Rodolfo Ramos for final comment.
Rodolfo Ramos: Thank you, Daniel. In terms of pricing, we are entering the first quarter of '22 in good shape for both Mexico and the United States. We considered that as long as there is a balance between supply and demand, we think those conditions go with -- however, we foresee a difficult  the first quarter of '21 as raw material prices remain high, which will pressure our cost of sales and tighten our margins.  Regarding I labor in the United States, we are starting to see improvement and we're confident that the efforts made our team in order to keep  will offset somehow the managing challenge in cost. Having decent landscape ahead, we keep working and being very close to our customer to fulfill their volume needs as efficient as possible while adding tricks to our business portfolio. With that, we now take your questions.
Operator: . We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from Fernando Olvera from Bank of America.
Fernando Olvera: Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. I have three, if I may. The third one is regarding the U.S. Can you comment what explains the decline in volume in the U.S., and how do you expect them to behave in 2022? And the other two questions are related to RYC Alimentos. Can you share what has been the growth of the business in the last five years, and if you have any initial thoughts about the potential growth of the business in the next five years, and the other one regarding the stores that the business has, initially what are your -- what are you planning to do with this force? Are you going to sell them or you will explore to grow this division? Thank you.
Rodolfo Ramos:  Daniel.
Daniel Salazar: Okay. Probably answering the first question in terms of our volume in the U.S., we are focused -- had a contraction for . One important one, is the lack of labor that limited our production capacity, but also some changes in our mix that end up in a reduction, probably middle single-digit for the year. But we are now in a very better shape, and we are recording our capacity. So we are whirlwind and recording that volume. And our expectation for the next year is to  out the middle single-digit.
Fernando Olvera: The second question about the briefly mentors growth. Historically this business has grown in around 5% in agility basis in a component growth rate. And our expectation is to at least maintain this level of growth. And with synergies that we have identified, we expect to increase this growth rate, but it's too soon to have a number in men because we are now in the integration process but at least we can say that we will maintain this growth rate. And I do not know if you want to share a little bit about the stores and repaying business line that  Alimentos are.
Rodolfo Ramos: Yeah. Alimentos.  expand the operation around 5%. But above equation has brought 2023 big projects of expansion overall. Wild how operation is underway. So we are going to see workforce, sales of PCM production in 2023, so the EPC next week Make a lot of sales in terms value-added products where we  the risk problem .  Particularly  a very good combination with capex. So we are very pleased with these executions in terms of development of the other platform and with synergies with that. So 2022,  will be around 5%. We expect to grow more in that current number. I think that is an inch for 2023.
Fernando Olvera: Great. Thank you so much. You are welcome Daniel.
Daniel Salazar: Thank you, Fernando.
Operator: Our next question comes from Emiliano Hernández from GBM.
Emiliano Hernández: Hi, Rodolfo and Daniel. Thanks for the space for questions. I have two, if I may. The first one is related to chicken prices in Mexico. Obviously, the comparison base next year is going to be very tough. You mentioned a good start of the year. Do you think with your pricing power ability, you will be able to maintain or even be above such levels? And then just a quick one, could you give us more color on the 29% increase in SG&A? What are the main pressures you're seeing there? And should we continue to see them in the coming quarters? Thank you.
Rodolfo Ramos: Thank you. Do you want to 
Daniel Salazar: Well, talking about the chicken base in Mexico, as you mentioned, we actually started in a very good shape in the first quarter, even that we haven't attained a vertical level of price, these are very tough for incoming months due to the rally that we have seen in the commodity prices for the raw material. It's very significant challenge for the months to come. It's difficult to predict that we will maintain our performance. But as far as we can say, we have maintained a very of good balance between supply and demand. So at this moment, we feel very comfortable in what we are doing into the company.  At least the first quarter will be probably above our expectations, but the second quarter, given that -- we have a high season ability for the second quarter. There are some challenges in the raw materials arena. In terms of our SG&A, 1/2 of the increase in the fourth quarter that we see is the recognition of the profit -- the PTU that is the profit that we share with our employees according to the new rules of the Mexican law and half of the increase is coming from the increasing sales that we have in the fourth quarter. In terms of   all point in maintenance for our distribution network. In order to manage the increasing volume. Basically down the tool -- the more significant items in SG&A increased.
Emiliano Hernández: Okay. Very clear, Daniel. Thank you very much. Have a good day.
Daniel Salazar: Thank you, Emiliano.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Fante, from Bradesco.
Juan Fante: All are all for Daniel. Thank you for taking my question. My question's on how you guys are seeing the first few weeks of 2022 in terms of supply chain issues. Do you see any moderation on the labor shortages, now that Omicron is somewhat winding down, particularly in the U.S. but also in Mexico? If you can talk a little bit about that, that'll be great. Thank you so much.
Rodolfo Ramos:  Here in Mexico, our  is under control and we have no problems of shortages of labor here in Mexico. The problem has been in the space. And right now, we're in a very good position. We increased our wages. We are very competitive in the marketplace, and we have been able to staff our lines. I think right now, we're almost 90% and we are -- everyday, we are reducing that gap. So I feel comfortable with the level of a -- levels that we have right now and that allow us to run our philosophies at full capacity at this moment.
Juan Fante: Okay. Thank you very much.
Rodolfo Ramos: Thank you, Fante.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ulises Argote from JPMorgan.
Ulises Argote:  final things for the space for questions, I had a couple, maybe more on the on the M&A angle, the first one related there to RYC Alimentos, can you give us any sense of what margins look like for this business and maybe if you have some changes to your long-term margin outlook, the  that you've always talked about? Does this shift in any way with the  business falling here? And then the second one maybe more on the potential of further M&A, but obviously you've heard that the JV there on SASA and now the acquisition of  over the last couple of years. So should we expect anything more in the M&A front in the short-term or are you focusing more on integrating and extracting the synergies from these two projects first and then moving to maybe other M&A or what's more or less the mindset that ever runs? Thank you.
Rodolfo Ramos: In terms of RYC Alimentos, we see a lot of synergies. Once the synergies are in place, we're going to have the same margins or better margins, but we need to capture those synergies. And I think we're going to have those synergies in place in the next quarter. The second quarter, we're going to capitalize those synergies. And for the next question, I will now ask Daniel to help me with that.
Daniel Salazar: Sure. Well, adding to the first question is  Call of margin of recall Alimentos East around or have been Iran 5% to 6%. And with all the seniors, roller per customer have mentioned, we expect at least to increase one or 2% points in long term. Right now, this industry not only rig, the industry has facing a very tough situation due to the prices of the midst. But anyway, we are very comfortable in that we can succeed in all the synergies that role cup mentioned and now talking about the other M&A opportunities, we are all -- besides the integration of RYC Alimentos, we are also looking for other opportunities outside Mexico, and I would say that the integration of RYC Alimentos will be probably -- will take less time than expected because we realized, I would say, a very good and talented management into the company. So this will allow us to complete the integration sooner than later in order to be more focused and try to complete additional M&A opportunities in the short-term.
Ulises Argote: Okay. That is very clear. Thank you so much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Fernando Mark (ph) Compass Group.
Fernando Mark: Thank you for taking my question. Just to talk a little bit about these price increases. Do you have any plans on hedging for 2022 and what are these plans, or do you have a specific plan to neutralize these price increases in raw materials? Thank you.
Rodolfo Ramos: The Intensive pricing hedge. We have gone through some of our customers for a long period time. Maybe with some of them holding you, totals get half a year results. When we do that, enrollment in , corn, soybean  and foreign exchange. So it's a client of cost plus agreement just  of them. All the way, we just have a very strict policy and we don't have more than two or three months of our consignments for the raw material in stock.  Except for some areas where we have domestic costs like in Norway and in the central and north east of the country and those areas we can buy more than two or three months. And sometimes, if the prices -- if the price allow us to buy the whole stock we just go to 12 months in advance, but it's no more than 20% of our requirements. But in terms of the risk, I can say that we have a hedge of maybe 15% of our requirements for those customers and the risk is we have no more than two or three months on the inventory. What we have seen in the past.  Take maybe to use in six months, transfer the cost increase to the price of the finished goods. So we cannot stick, we date through, hop on more than that time and now we're at inventory. And thus though we're all BC than we had been handled all the time, and we are very strict and we could stick with that time."
