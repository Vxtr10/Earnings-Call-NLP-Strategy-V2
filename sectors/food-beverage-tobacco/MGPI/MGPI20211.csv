"Operator: Good day and welcome to the MGP Ingredients First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Houston. Please go ahead.
Mike Houston: Thank you. I'm Mike Houston with Lambert &amp; Company, MGP's Investor Relations firm, and joining me today are members of their management team including Dave Colo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brandon Gall, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin the call with management's prepared remarks and then open the call up to questions. However, before we begin today's call, it is my responsibility to inform you that this call may involve certain forward-looking statement, such as projections of sales, operating income, gross margin and effective tax rate, as well as statements on the plans and objectives of the Company's business. The Company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today due to a number of factors, including the risk factors described in the Company's most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Dave Colo: Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining us. On this call, we will provide an overview of our results for the quarter, updates on key financial performance metrics and a discussion of progress against our strategy. Then we will take your questions. We are very pleased with our continued momentum this quarter which has again yielded record consolidated results. Sales of premium beverage alcohol increased 31.1% primarily due to higher aged whiskey and new distillate sales. As expected during the quarter, we experienced temporary softness in our Ingredient Solutions segment primarily due to a natural gas curtailment that impacted approximately 2 weeks of production in February. However, we anticipate improved results in the second quarter as we have cycled past the weather related events in the first quarter. Consolidated sales for the quarter increased 9.3%, while gross profit increased 39.2% to a record $32.3 million, representing 29.8% of consolidated sales. Reported operating income increased 49.6%, while adjusted operating income increased 56.7%.Looking at each segment individually. In our Distillery Products segment, sales increased 11.5%, primarily driven by sales and brown goods, which increased 49.3% from the prior year period. Strong aged whiskey and new distillate sales led to these results. Aged whiskey sales also served as the primary driver to the increase in gross margins for the period. Our objective to optimize brown goods profit, by increasing volume share at market based pricing continue to benefit both the segment and consolidated results for the quarter. The macro consumer trend supporting the ongoing growth of the American whiskey category remains solid, which is confirmed by the demand we're experiencing from new and existing brown goods customers. We also experienced strong aged whiskey demand from craft distillers, as a percent of our overall aged sales mix during the quarter, which was more comparable to pre-COVID levels, in relation to our national and multinational customers. While our consumer demand for American whiskey remains robust and our diverse customer mix has positioned us well, we anticipate our growth rates will begin to normalize and come more in line with overall category growth. Continuing on to other areas of the segment, sales of premium beverage white goods declined 0.3% for the quarter, while sales of industrial alcohol decreased 19.8% with improved pricing and margins. As mentioned in our last call, the decline in industrial alcohol sales was primarily attributed to reduce third-party sales of industrial alcohol produced by ICP, our former joint venture partner.
Brandon Gall: Thanks, Dave. For the quarter, consolidated sales increased 9.3% to $108.3 million, as a result of double-digit growth in premium beverage alcohol within the Distillery Products segment. Gross profit increased 39.2% to $32.3 million due to improved gross profits in the Distillery Products segment. Gross margin increased by 640 basis points to 29.8%. As noted in our last earnings call, we experienced a fire at the Atchison facility during the fourth quarter which damaged feed drying equipment and caused a temporary loss of production time. During the first quarter, we recorded a $3.6 million partial settlement from our insurance carrier. We are working to construct a replacement drying system that is anticipated to be operational in the fourth quarter of this year. Until the replacement system is operational, however, we anticipate this will continue to effect gross profit results. However, we expect a portion, if not all of these losses will be offset by our business interruption insurance coverage, similar to the past 2 quarters. Please note, however, the timing of any insurance recovery despite best efforts is outside of our control and may not occur in the same period as the recognized loss. Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $2.3 million to $11.8 million as compared to the first quarter 2020, primarily due to business acquisition costs related to the Luxco transaction. We will incur additional transaction related costs, the majority of which will occur in the second quarter of 2021. We anticipate fully transitioning our legacy MGP brands into the Luxco sales and marketing organization during the second quarter, which will be reflected in our quarterly results and reported under the newly established branded Spirits segment going forward. Operating income for the first quarter increased 49.6% to $20.5 million primarily due to strong brown goods sales within the Distillery Products segment. Non-GAAP operating income increased 56.7% to $22.4 million exclusive of business acquisition costs related to the Luxco transaction. Our corporate effective tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared with 24.7% a year ago, primarily due to additional tax credits recognized as a result of the new drying system investment. Net income for the first quarter increased 56.7% to $15.4 million and earnings per share increased to $0.90 from $0.57 per share, primarily due to higher operating income. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter increased to $1.01 per share from $0.61 per share exclusive of business acquisition costs related to the Luxco transaction. Cash flow from operations was $17 million in the first quarter, which was up from approximately $500,000 in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting the strong cash generating capability of our business. In addition to improved operating results, our operating cash flows were also driven by the combination of record aged sales and reduced put away for aging whiskey inventory. MGP's balance sheet and access to capital remain strong, allowing us to continue to invest to grow and drive long-term shareholder value.
Dave Colo: Thanks, Brandon. We remain committed to the execution of our long-term growth strategy, further building on the momentum from last year. We recently achieved a significant milestone in our strategic plan with the completion of the Luxco acquisition in April and have begun the integration and synergy work streams necessary to optimize our combined business while setting ourselves on a path for anticipated future growth. The newly combined company will greatly expand our portfolio of higher value added branded spirits from coast-to-coast. We now have 3 business segments that are uniquely aligned with strong consumer trends, which we believe will create long-term and sustainable shareholder value.
Operator:  Our first question today will come from Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum.
Alex Fuhrman: Wanted to ask about the implications of the Luxco acquisition to the numbers. I know it's tough from where you're sitting right now to really give a firm projection for 2021 including Luxco, but can you kind of help us out, just given that it's going to have a really significant impact on the numbers. What would it have added in the last 3 quarters of 2020? Just any sort of kind of base case or historical framing of what Luxco has done in terms of top-line and EBITDA contribution, would be really helpful as we think about our model.
Brandon Gall: Yes, Alex, this is Brandon. First of all, thanks for the question and happy to provide some clarity where I can. So thing I point back toward is the investor presentation we released in January, when we announced the Luxco transaction. Yes, there were some of the financials shared at the time on a adjusted unaudited basis for 2019, but also on an LTM basis as of October 2020, that should be pretty directionally, I think for what you're trying to accomplish. I will share also that as we're now more than a month into integration of Luxco, we are still -- we're in the traps on the numbers as we mentioned already, but revenue surprises and things are coming -- progressing along very nicely on that front.
Alex Fuhrman: Great, that's really helpful. And then just as we think about the sales of aged whiskey and this is really now 3 quarters in a row that you've had good success in selling the aged whiskey, and you mentioned that it's hard to really forecast what that demand is going to look like in the future. I mean, is there a sense that, given that the demand is strong right now that we can continue to see strong sales a bit this year as long as the demand is there? Just anything you can kind of tell us about your current -- I know there's not so much visibility in a multi-year, but at least looking at over the next couple of months, is that kind of what you've been seeing, any direction there would be helpful.
Dave Colo: Alex, this is Dave. Yes, we have experienced really strong demand for our aged whiskey as we mentioned in the last 3 to 4 quarters, Q1 as well, obviously a very strong quarter. We -- the best indication that we have, that we keep trying to guide to is the fact that we think over time, our growth rate should be pretty much in line with the overall American whiskey category growth rates. We recognize that quarter-to-quarter, our growth could be above or below that as evidenced by what we've seen here in Q1. But as we look forward, that's kind of the guide post we reference is overall we think that is -- as the American whiskey category grows, that's where we would expect our growth rates to be in line with. Also if you look at our inventory position and we spoke to this in the prepared remarks, we feel like we've -- we pulled down our inventory levels of our aged put-away the last year. We feel the level that we're at now is a pretty good level, and I would say it's kind of at level of equilibrium, meaning on a go-forward basis, we would look to put-away the amount of whiskey based on what we think our forecasted demand is going to be within that given year. So we feel good about that. We think our inventory positions are much more balanced today than they were a year ago and we'll continue to put away whiskey again based on what we think our projected demand going forward will be.
Alex Fuhrman: And then my last question, the Ingredient Solution side of the business, I mean that's been a really top performing segment for a while now, and it sounds like from your prepared remarks that the demand from your customers for your offerings remain very strong, and there were some reasons why we didn't see that in the numbers this quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about that and when we should start to see reported results, start the math what you're seeing in terms of customer demand?
Dave Colo: Yes, I think in Q1 we kind of gave a forecast of this in our Q4 call. We had the -- in the month of February, we lost about 2 weeks of production in our Ingredients business due to the cold weather that came through the Midwest, our natural gas supply was curtailed which resulted in us needing to shut down operations through that period. As we restarted operations and got into March, we had a very strong March, both from a top-line and a gross margin performance more in line with what historically we've printed on that business last year. And as we go into Q2 and the balance of the year, we still are having very strong demand and we would expect the business to have similar gross margins to what we've been reporting in the prior year. So we're still very confident in that business. We have cycle past the weather related events in Q1 and feel like we're back on track for the balance of the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.
Bill Chappell: Just I guess first question on the guidance and especially on the distillery business and you're commentary of it growing in line with the category. I guess 1, can you quantify how much the -- and you might have already done this, the white goods issue, I mean the switchover, how much that impacted on this year? And then 2, I'm just trying to more importantly couple the statements because you would think if you're selling aged inventory on a regular basis, which has a significantly higher price point and transaction value then new distillate, that you should -- your sale should grow faster than the category until you're out of our product or cycle through that. So help me understand why you would only grow in line with that if you're still selling aged for the foreseeable future?
Brandon Gall: Yes Bill, this is Brandon. First of all on the switchover, the total sales through ICP which is third-party contractors, that we've set partnership with last year was around $24 million in total and that hits our industrial alcohol product line. This year, we expect to be finish selling by the second quarter of this year and we expect the total to be somewhere around $4 million in total sales for 2021. As it relates to your brown question, which is a really good one. There -- as Dave mentioned, there is variability within brown even within the mix, there is pricing as you correctly pointed out for aged is much greater than new distillate. And then as we sell 1, 2, 3 and 4 year old, there's different pricing for each of those as well. So as we cycle over quarters, we may sell a lot of aged 1 quarter that even more than we did the prior comparative quarter, but if it's a different vintage, if it were signed more 1 year old versus 4 year old, it may not have what you think would be the desired result, from selling that much more volume. So it's not that straightforward. What we do know is that, we've seen 4 or 5 straight quarters now of extreme demand for our brown goods specifically for aged and there are underlying trends that would indicate that that can continue. But as we know there could also be, as we've experienced some variability to that business is due to the customer buying patterns that we've discussed.
Bill Chappell: So just to follow that, so is your guidance for the remainder of the year, or just assuming there is no further aged sales and that would just be upside and that -- were that -- or are you thinking that the aged sales are front end loaded this year and you'll see a lesser amount as we move through the year?
Brandon Gall: Yeah, it's probably more of the latter, Bill. So, our -- as we put together the guidance at this early on in the year, especially if we're coming off strong quarter and a strong few quarters for aged, if you -- actually if we go back and look at the last 3 quarters, it is a little bit more front loaded, but for the full year, we do have our total brown sales growing closer in line with the category.
Bill Chappell: And then second question, can you give us any update on at least top-line trends for Luxco for the first quarter? I mean, have they continue to grow, has there been any issues, anything we should be thinking about?
Brandon Gall: Yes, can't share a lot on the first quarter at this point, and believe me Bill, it's not because I don't want to, we've been working on this for a long time, we're really excited about the deal, we can't wait to share more with you in Q2. What I will share is what I already mentioned a little bit to Alex, is that we have not seen any surprises since January, and that would make us feel differently about the numbers we shared at that point in time, which again are still -- should be still on our website and available. But we do have to finish running the traps and put together the required accounting that's necessary to really provide more informed guidance. We hate to -- won't get a little bit ahead of ourselves now, only to have to slow you or revise that at all a quarter now. We're just going to be prudent in our approach, and I will be as clear as possible with you and with the investors when the time is right.
Bill Chappell: And then last 2 questions. Sorry, 1, going back to brown spirits, I mean, it seems that the conversion over the past year of how you're viewing the aged has been from creating an asset that you can sell for top dollar to creating a library for your customers to shop whenever they want. And I didn't know if that's having a negative impact on new distillate because now your customers can see like, look we can buy on consignment and just buy it in 3, 4 years, we don't need to buy it upfront, that's having an adverse effect near term or expected to on your new distillate business?
Dave Colo: Yes, I think our -- we still sell a lot of new distillates and a lot of those customers are on a contract basis. I think through the last I'd say 3 to 4 quarters in -- as a result of COVID, I think what we've seen is, on brown goods, in particular on aged in the last 2 to 3 quarters, we've seen the craft distillers kind of come back into the aged market in a pretty significant way and now they're back in line with kind of their historical buying patterns, if you will, Bill. So I think long-term we still view the balance between aged and new distillate to be in line with what we've seen over the last 3 to 4 years. That's something that we evaluate literally quarter-to-quarter and obviously, it also influences how much MGP owned inventory we put away. But at this point, we still sell a lot of new distillate, we expect that to continue and we also expect to see some pretty good growth patterns in the aged side of the business as well.
Bill Chappell: Last question from me. Just the insurance settlement in the quarter, didn't know whether that -- I think that's included in the numbers and in your full year guidance. I could be wrong and just didn't know where that's all in gross margin or that's all in SG&A, just any clarity there would be helpful.
Brandon Gall: Yes, so we did recognize a partial insurance settlement of around $3.5 million, $3.7 million in the quarter that is treated as a reduction to cost of goods sold, so it will hit the gross margin. The actual receipt was closer to $8.5 million. The difference we have on our balance sheet until we can -- because a portion of that going to go towards different areas, whether it's more business interruption or whether it's the sort of driver placing itself. So until we get more clarity and get closer to the -- and if not or even complete the replacement drive system, we are going to keep that on our balance sheet just to be conservative and then recognize it when we have more visibility and clarity.
Bill Chappell: But the $3.7 is in the non-GAAP EPS for the quarter and then in your full year guidance to $2 to $2.15 for the year, is that correct?
Brandon Gall: It's actually, yes, it's in the GAAP reported for the quarter because we were -- we did receive and recover it in the quarter. And yes, we are factoring that for the year. We are going to offset the majority if not all of our business interruption impacts with insurance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Dave Colo for any closing remarks.
Dave Colo: Thank you for your interest in our company and for joining us today for our first quarter call. We look forward to talking with you again after the second quarter. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
