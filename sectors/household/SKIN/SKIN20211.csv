Last week, we successfully closed our business combination and became The Beauty Health Company. This was not only an important corporate milestone for the company, but also a significant event in beauty health, which is a category we have pioneered. The capital and strategic resources from this transaction position as well to expand our footprint globally and deliver sustainable growth. In addition, beauty health is the ideal platform towards achieving our goal of building an enduring and premier company in the beauty health category. I would like to extend my congratulations and appreciation to the team that made this combination and our success possible. Between our management and Board of Directors with a diverse range of expertise, we are confident that we have assembled an accomplished team with significant experience to appropriately fuel and guide the growth of beauty health. Turning now to the business. As you will hear later from Clint and Liyuan, this is a very resilient business, as evidenced by the financial performance in the first quarter. And we believe we have plenty of growth opportunities ahead as we begin to emerge from the global pandemic. My objective is to ensure that this new public company has the appropriate resources and team to deploy the right strategies in order to unleash growth. Over the minimum long-term, I believe this is the ideal platform to create an enduring growth company in the category of beauty health. I'm excited about our next chapter’s beauty health and the significant growth opportunity we have ahead.
Clint Carnell: Thank you, Brent, and hello, everyone. It is great to be speaking with you today on our first earnings call as a public company. I will begin by discussing an overview of who we are at beauty health and why we are uniquely positioned for sustainable long-term growth. After which I will touch on some highlights from our first quarter and share our outlook and growth strategies. I'll then turn the call to Liyuan to discuss our first quarter financial performance in detail. Over the past few months, we have shared with you our vision of creating a powerful consumer brand and platform business that redefined the emerging category, we created beauty health. With delivery systems of over 17,000 and millions of consumers treated worldwide today, we are the clear leaders in the category.

Liyuan Woo: Thank you, Clint and hello everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication throughout this unprecedented period. The hard work and commitment of our people drove our impressive growth this quarter in a still challenging environment, demonstrating the unique flexibility of our team and our business model. We did see outsized performance in this quarter, despite the continued select global market closures related to COVID-19 government mandate restrictions. With that in mind, I will make select comparisons to our first quarter of 2019 in my prepared remarks, as it removes anomaly created by the COVID-19 related market closures, which also impacted 2020. We believe this comparison will provide you with a more comprehensive understanding of our growth profile. Starting with our first quarter results net sales of 47.5 million, increased 46% from 2020 and 37% from 2019, our increase in revenue was primarily driven by significant expansion in our delivery systems with over 16,000 globally and strength in our predictable recurring consumable revenue streams. For the first quarter, delivery systems revenue increased 82% and 51% and consumables were up 19% and 23% from the same period in 2020 and 2019 respectively. Net sales in the Americas region increased 31% to 31.3 million compared to a 23.9 million in the prior year or increased 18% compared to 26.5 million in 2019. The strength was driven by continued traction in the U.S. as well as accelerating consumer demand. It's important to note that with the second wave of COVID-19, we had significant location closures in the first half of Q1 2021. Although the market did reopened once vaccines were available, we still had our non-medical channels in select States, such as retail partners, gyms, hotels, casinos and spa with many closed locations.
Clint Carnell: Thank you, Liyuan. Our team's performance in the first quarter shows excellent execution. We continue to deliver on the guidance we provided in November during a highly uncertain environment. We remained focused on creating exceptional customer experiences and are seeing strong results from our investments in growth and innovation. As our markets reopen, we are encouraged by the demand for our services as consumer interest in health and wellness continues to accelerate. Looking ahead, we are focused on building our strong community, executing our growth strategy and creating long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your time and for joining today's call. And we look forward to continuing to update you on our future progress. Operator?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.
