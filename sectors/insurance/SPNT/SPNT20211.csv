"Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the SiriusPoint Limited First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Kerrigan, Head of Investor Relations for SiriusPoint. Please go ahead.
Clare Kerrigan: Thank you, operator. Welcome to the SiriusPoint Limited earnings call for the first quarter of 2021. Last night, we issued our first quarter Form 10-Q, an earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available on our website, www.sirius.pt.com.  With me here today are Sid Sankaran, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Junius, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that many of the remarks today will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the earnings press release and the company's other public filings, including the most recent Form 10-Q where you will find risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Sid Sankaran: Thank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to be here today to officially introduce SiriusPoint following the completion of Third Point Re's merger with Sirius Group in February. Our combined company has the capital, platform, capabilities, culture and expertise to take advantage of changing market conditions and compete in a differentiated and effective fashion in the global insurance and reinsurance marketplaces. I'm extremely pleased that by the closing of our transaction, we've added world-class talent to our team, strengthened the quality of our balance sheet and refocused our underwriting strategy, allowing us to benefit from strong market conditions. We are creating an entrepreneurial and innovative company that is just at the beginning of its transformation. Today, SiriusPoint is a meaningful player in the insurance and reinsurance markets, comprising a global platform that serves clients and brokers in almost 150 countries. And it has an outstanding team of experienced leaders and underwriters, many of them long-tenured with us, and a robust balance sheet, comprising more than $3 billion of capital. We still view ourselves as a start-up company, where we see the insurance industry is ripe for change. SiriusPoint is going to be at the forefront of that change. COVID-19 has dramatically changed the world's perception of risk. Over the past few years, the spectrum of realistic disaster scenarios has become more apparent. And the insurance industry response to that requires product innovation, better risk management and capital. With the start-ups mentality, and a responsive team of experienced underwriters, we can quickly develop solutions to help our clients manage this new risk environment. Our vision is to grow our business, create value and positively impact the change in world by being the most adaptive and responsive reinsurer in the market. We are aiming to enhance our existing relationships and improve the economics of our key lines of business, while looking at ways that we can grow intelligently and leverage technology to improve how we underwrite and manage risk, use data and develop new strategic opportunities. As a new company with an entrepreneurial approach and abundant energy to embrace and drive industry disruption and positive change, we are very much a start-up insurer, but a company with the 75-year history in relationships that we view -- and we are part of the class of 2020. We feel we have a head start over the other new entrants in the market as we have existing sticky relationships and business, a broad product offering, existing infrastructure and global reach. We also have a solid foundation, with a strong balance sheet, as can be seen in our A minus ratings, which were confirmed by A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch during the first quarter 2021. As a result, we're big enough to matter while having the ability to remain nimble, responsive and collaborative. This approach is at the heart of our entrepreneurial culture and is what drives our team.
David Junius: Thanks, Sid. Since the formal merger on February 26, SiriusPoint has had a strong start to 2021. Importantly, we have had good feedback from rating agencies, investors, employees, clients and prospective partners. While much was accomplished in these initial weeks, much work remains to be done to re-underwrite our portfolio, establish a good operating rhythm for the combined company, assess and address talent gaps and overall, our IT infrastructure. We are excited with our plan and the opportunity that we see ahead. Turning to our first quarter results. We reported net income of $131 million, which includes $9 million of bargain purchase gain or $1.05 per diluted share. Our annualized return on average equity was 26.4% and ending shareholders' equity was $2.6 billion. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with tangible diluted book value per share of $13.97, a decrease of 16% from year-end due to share issuances related to our acquisition of Sirius Group. Our results were driven by our strong investment returns, highlighted by the TP enhanced funds return of 14.6% in the first quarter, and a $35 million increase in the valuation of our investment in Pie. These results were above our investment return expectations, and we do not expect them to be recurring. To Sid's point on investment derisking TP enhanced funds plus other invested assets were 1/4 of total invested assets at March 31, down from more than 1/3 at year-end for TPRE stand-alone. Turning to underwriting. Our primary focus for the year is to deliver an underwriting profit, and the first quarter was a good first step in fulfilling this goal. Gross premiums written, as reported, were $367 million, reflecting only 1 month of Sirius Group contribution. Including a full 3 months of Sirius Group, GPW was $949 million in the quarter. Overall, we are seeing market conditions stabilize around the world driven by underwriting discipline and positive rate improvement. That said, the rate story continues to differ by product, with heavily impacted lines such as aviation, seeing strong rate increases, while less differentiated lines such as workers' comp, that have seen strong rate adequacy in the past few years, starting to soften. These rate trends continued in the first quarter and for April 1 renewals, where some lines showed double-digit rate improvements. Property cat reinsurance also continues to see risk-adjusted rate increases in most global markets but at a declining pace. However, the market has not yet fully digested the impact of the high levels of cats in the first quarter. While property cat is a core part of the portfolio, we are focused on growth in the noncat lines to continue to improve our balance as well as carefully evaluating the allocation and utilization of our cat PML to improve portfolio return. Underwriting income in the first quarter was $9 million, generating a combined ratio of 96.6%. Our reported results include only 1 month of results for Sirius Group and Sirius Group's Texas Storm Uri losses fell into the premerger stub period. Total catastrophe losses that include a full 3 months of Sirius Group were $40 million and the associated accident year combined ratio on that basis was 99.8. Breaking out underwriting further, I'd like to discuss our 4 segments: A&H, Specialty, Property and Runoff. A&H was 37% of GPW in the quarter and almost wholly reflects the results of the legacy Sirius Group as legacy TPRE business in this segment was limited. A&H produced an underwriting profit of $5.3 million and a combined ratio of 84.9, which reflects strong results in the primary reinsurance and ArmadaCare segments, while IMG, which is travel focused, continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we are encouraged by the pace of vaccinations, particularly in the U.S. and expect a pick up in travel in the second half of 2021. Specialty represented 46% of GPW in the quarter. Underwriting income was largely breakeven with a 100.2 combined ratio and reflects prudent loss fix in the growing Arcadian, Pie and environmental books to account for the greenness of this business despite our overall confidence in these platforms to generate underwriting income in the long term. Property was 17% of GPW in the quarter, producing an underwriting profit of $5.4 million and a combined ratio of 93.3. While this quarter's reported results clearly benefited from Sirius' Uri losses falling into the premerger period, the pro forma accident year combined ratio for this segment was 99.4 on higher cat losses. We have an attractive, globally diversified cat portfolio, where we will also take advantage of the highest risk-adjusted returns when allocating our peak zone cat PML, a process we anticipate continuing through January 1 of next year. Runoff had minimal production in the quarter as new blocks available in the market did not meet our pricing hurdles. The underwriting loss of $1.7 million reflects runoff of legacy portfolios, in line with expectations, and segment results do not benefit from an allocation of investment income. Turning to expenses. Total corporate and other expenses were $68 million in the first quarter, largely driven by $40 million of transaction-related expenses and severance as well as $17 million to reestablish the Sirius Group provision for expected credit losses, which was taken down in purchase accounting. Underwriting expenses were slightly lower than expectations. On the balance sheet, in addition to the disclosures on the impact of the acquisition in our 10-Q, I also call your attention to the December 31, 2020, pro forma balance sheet filed in our 8-Ka last Friday. The opening balance sheet is on a strong footing, and I'd like to call out a few of the most significant items. First, transaction-related intangibles were established with a valuation of $174 million and largely reflect distribution and managing general underwriter relationships and the value of our insurance licenses. Second, the casualty reserves of Sirius Group were aligned on the same basis that we took when we strengthened TPRE reserves in the fourth quarter of 2020. This adjustment resulted in a $70 million increase in the opening balance sheet casualty reserves for the legacy Sirius book. This places us higher in the range of actuarial best estimates. Third, our COVID ultimate loss picks in the quarter were unchanged to $364 million, with IBNR representing approximately 60% of outstanding COVID reserves. We continue to monitor COVID developments closely, but believe we are adequately reserved, absent a significant shift in the regulatory environment or coverage interpretations. Fourth, we've established a fair market liability of $135 million for the contingent consideration capital instruments issued in the acquisition of Sirius Group, including the Series A performance shares, warrants, contingent value rights and upside rights. These values may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on the SiriusPoint stock price and other factors. Our shareholders' equity as of March 31 was $2.6 billion and includes $200 million of newly issued Series B preference shares. We issued 58 million common shares in the acquisition to bring our total shares outstanding to 162 million. Outstanding debt at the quarter end was $829 million, which is comprised of the previously issued TPRE senior debt and the assumed Sirius Group senior debt and sub debt. No new debt was issued in the transaction. The resultant debt-to-capital ratio is 24% at March 31. The overall capital levels remain strong, with regulatory capital well above compliance requirements and above rating agency expectations. SiriusPoint also maintains a high level of liquidity, with $2.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. We also established a $300 million revolver as an additional source of liquidity, if needed, which remains undrawn. Now let me turn the call back to Sid for concluding remarks.
Sid Sankaran: Thanks, David. I'm truly proud to be leading Sirius' plan. We've built a truly exciting new company with a differentiated culture and approach, and we're set up to challenge the status quo to create new ways of conducting business. We remain committed to establishing a more balanced and diversified business through a prudent mix of underwriting and investment risk. As we execute and deliver more consistent results over time, we expect to build sustained long-term value for our shareholders. I believe that we have a bright future ahead of us build with enormous potential. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn the call back over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.
