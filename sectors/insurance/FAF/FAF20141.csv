"Jeremy E. Campbell: Hey, good morning. All right, so we have First American Financial and CFO, Mark Seaton has the honor to be at the Mariano Rivera to the Global Financial Service Conference here and close it out. He’s has been the CFOs now with the Company for quite a while and with that we also have Craig Barberio up here from Investor Relations. With that, we’ll just turn it over to Mark.
Mark E. Seaton: Thank you, Jeremy. Yes, I want to thank Jeremy for inviting us to the conference here. This is I don’t how many years it’s really been here, but we've had a long history with Barclays and so we’re happy to be here again this year. Again, we have the distinction of being the last company to present in the last day here. So thank for taking the interest in First American. Before I started, I want to alert you to our Safe Harbor Statements as well as our statement around the use of non-GAAP financial measures. First American, we’ve got a history of growth. We’ve really started the Company back in 1889 in Orange County and for many decades we grew the Company, in 1982 we completely build out our footprint in the U.S. and that’s the year that we reached all 50 states. In the mid-80s we began expanding our products outside of Taiwan in escrow to other complementary businesses and in 2010 we spun-off a lot of those businesses into a separate public company. And our Company as we know it has been in its current legal structure since June of 2010. We are an industry leader, we’ve got the second most market share in the U.S. of 27%, we’re the largest provider of title plan information in the U.S., we’re number one internationally and we’re also the second largest home warranty company behind the company called American Home Shield. We’ve got a very strong financial position $5 billion of revenue about $300 million free cash flow last year and we’ve got relatively low debt at a 15% debt-to-capital ratio. Our total shareholder returns since the spin-off has been favorable, you can see on the bottom line there. Our stock has been up on average 19% annualized since the spin-off and that’s up versus 17% for the S&P and 16% for Russell 2000. Year-to-date the returns haven’t been as good relative to the benchmark, but certainly when you look at the one-year and the three-year we’ve outperformed the benchmarks fairly significantly. In terms of investment consideration, we’re a pure play in the title and mortgage markets. We have – all of our eggs are in the title and the settlement services basket. We’re not diversified in the sense that we don’t own manufacturing businesses and other types of business, but we are diversified within title and mortgage. We've got a very strong commercial business, strong refi, strong purchase, strong default. So we are diversified within the tile and the mortgage markets, but we’re a pure play. We’ve got a very strong competitive position and we are pursuing growth opportunities both domestically and internationally. We have made a lot of changes to our cost structures over the last five-year, six-years. That really has enhanced our long-term’s earnings power. Today our title company is running at roughly a 10% pretax margin and historically that has been the peak margins for First American. Back when we were in a $3 trillion mortgage market First American used to hit 10% margins. Now we’re in $1 trillion mortgage market and we are hitting 10% margin. So we are hitting as high of margins we've ever hit in the past, despite the fact of the market as low as it’s ever been in the past. And we’ve taken out a lot of structural costs which I’ll get into a little bit later in the presentation. And we also have a meaningful opportunity to return capital to shareholders. We doubled our dividend earlier this year; we’re paying $0.96 per year which is about 3.4% yield. Historically First American has paid about 20% of our earnings in dividends and now we’re paying roughly 40% of our earnings in dividends. So that’s a strategic move that we've made that says that we want to return significant amount of our capital back to our shareholders and we are going to continue to do that over time. And then we also repurchase shares opportunistically, last year we purchased 3 million shares at an average price of $21.90 and that’s been a good investment for us. So we are very opportunistic and we buyback our stock when we feel like it’s undervalued. This slides shows our strategy, our vision is to the premier title insurance and settlement services company. We are not saying we want to be number one in every market, we want to be the best, we want to have the best returns to our shareholders, we want to have the best service to our customers and we want to be the best place to work for our employees and we’re tracking metrics along all three of those mentions. In terms of where we are going to compete, those are the three pillars you can see here on the left, we want to gain profitable market share in our core title and closing business. So we are always going to compete in title insurance, it’s our core business, its what we do, its what we've done since 1899 and that’s always going to be a key part of our strategy. The middle pillar is something that we’re going to talk a lot more about today and in the future, but we have a [burgeoning] (ph) data in mortgage solutions business, we’re providing solutions to lenders to help them either mitigate risk or increase share or improve their margins. And so we’ll talk more about that later in the presentation. And then the third pillar is really our complementary businesses. We have businesses in First American that aren’t our core title insurance business, but it’s providing other software and services to our customers that make a lot of sense for them to be underneath the First American umbrella. So those are the three areas that we’re going to compete in, we’re not going to get outside of this; we've got a very focused strategy. And on the bottom pertains to capital management, we’re going to focus M&A on enhancing the core and we want to optimize our capital management strategy as well. And so we’ll talk more about that in a few minutes. This slide shows the mortgage origination trends, on the upper left is the residential mortgage originations for the MBA and the bad news on this slide as you can see the residential originations have really been decline since 2006. This slide we show since 2012. And 2014 originations are expected to hit trough of about a $1 trillion most of that coming from purchase about 40% of it or so coming from refinance. The good news here is that we feel like 2014 will be a trough in terms of the market. We feel like there is going to be growth in 2015 and beyond. And the other good news on this slide is we get paid twice as much for purchase transactions than we do for refinance transaction. And so the purchase market is going to be growing next year and beyond and that’s really our core business. We have 800 offices in the direct channel and most of those are there to service the purchase market. On the commercial revenue on the bottom left, there is not as great projections for the commercial market, but we show our commercial revenue here since 2009 and its been growing at 31% a year for the last four-years to five-years really since 2009. So last year we did $546 million of commercial, we’ve got 45 national commercial offices scattered throughout the major capital market centers in the U.S. especially here in New York. And we do very well in commercial, we've got very good people, we've got a very good system, very good platform, we've got good financial strength, good balance sheet and we play very well in commercial and has relatively higher margins than the rest of our operations. We’re also seeing a lot of broad-based strength in commercial in terms of the types of assets that we’re seeing, its coming from multifamily, its coming from industrial, it’s coming from office. So we’re seeing a broad-based strength and we think that the strength in the commercial market will continue for the next couple of years and that plays very well for us. In terms of market share, we basically have two channels that we sell our products. So our direct channel where we have a direct relationship with the customer, whether it’s the lender or mortgage broker or real estate agent and we do the search and the examination, we issue the policy and we pay the claims and we keep 100% of premium. That’s the direct channel. The agency channel is where we have agents that are completely unaffiliated with First American and they have the relationship with the customer and they do the search and the exam, but they are not underwriter so they issue our policy and for that we typically on average get about 20% of the premium some state its higher, some state its lower but on average its about 20%. We’ve got 800 offices across the U.S. and we've got 7,650 agents that we support in our agency channel. You can on the direct graph that our market share in direct has really been up since the spin-off, its up to 1.3% and most of those gains have come really in the last two years, we've been very focused on gaining profitable share in our direct business and its starting to pay dividends and we are very focused on the top four states: California, Florida, Texas and New York. This is really where we’re emphasizing a lot of our time and efforts and gaining shares in those four states in a very profitable way. And we gain share in a variety of different ways, but a couple of them is one is customer-facing technology. First American has always been very strong in back office technology and we've invested a lot of capital in customer-facing technologies with platforms such as myFirstAm and AgentNet and we’re starting to see those [businesses] (ph) payoff. And we are also geographic – we've transitioned from a geographic centric structure to a customer centric structure. So the old First American was really organized around geographies and today it’s really around the customers, we've got a commercial channel and agency channel, a direct channel, a homebuilders channel and servicer channel. And this just allows us to respond to needs of our customers a lot more efficiently and effectively. On the agency channel, on the bottom you can see we've gained share, we've gained about 50 basis points a share since 2000, but the number of agents that we have has declined 6%. So we’re getting more business from fewer agents, so the quality of the book is better and the average premium that we get per agent is higher than it has been historically. This slide shows that we have improved market share, in fact in those top four states. So the yellow bubbles represent the top four states, so we’re really focused on California, Texas, Florida and New York. Anything to the left of center were underrepresented in terms of our overall market share. So we have 27% market share, anything to the left side of that graph were less than 27%, anything to right were higher. And then this is market share change since the spin-off in 2000. So anything above zero, we've gained share since 2000, anything below we've lost share since 2000. So the good news here is that again the key four states all of those four states were underrepresented, we've gained anywhere from 200 basis points to 400 basis points a share over the last 3.5 years. We have lost share in a couple of states, you can see Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Arizona the states ranked six through 10 and every state has a different story. Some of those have been intentional market share losses, some of them haven’t, but overall here we’re very pleased with the share gains that we’re getting and particularly where they are coming from. This slide shows our controllable expense over time since 2007, as well as our margins. You can see the red line is our Title Insurance segment pretax margins since 2007, and generally speaking the line is on an upward trend. And today we’re running roughly about a 10% margin. Now our margins have been increasing since 2007 despite the fact that the mortgage origination markets has been declining dramatically during this exactly – exacting time period. And one of the questions that we always get is how can you improve margins despite the fact the markets declining? Well one of the big thing is we've been able to control our costs; we've taken of lot of structural costs out of the business during this time. The blue line represents what we call our controllable expenses. These are personal costs and are other operating expenses like real estate and production cost as a percentage of our revenue and you can see that has been declining. We've used to have 30 accounting center, now we have two accounting centers. We used to have 30 data centers; we've got two data centers. We've centralized and standardized and simplified a lot of our processes and have a very significant offshore platform and those are the things that had allowed us to really improve our cost structure. The thing that gets us excited is that as the market continues to improve and we get to a normalized mortgage market we’re going to have a record margins and record earnings and now just the question is when does that normalizes market happen? But we feel like we’re much more efficient and than we've ever been in the history of our business. This slide shows our open to loss ratio by policy year, it speaks to our claims experience; the blue bars represent the loss ratio by policy year. So for example, in 2007 of the premiums that we wrote in 2007 ultimately we expect to payout 12.8% of those claims – of that premium in claims. Historically the loss rates in title insurance have hovered covered somewhere between 5% and 6%. In the credit crisis years 2005 to 2008, a lot of those properties that are going to foreclosure, First American get the claims when there is foreclosures and so the loss rates were really higher that we've seen in the modern era. The good news here is between 2009 and 2014, we feel like the business that we've been running has been very good from a loss rate perspective and those policy years are really going to help us for years to come. So the underwriting for the last few years has been very, very good as our own underwriting standards have tightened and the underwriting standard of banks have tightened and we feel like that will definitely continue for the next several years. The red line represents our paid claims, our cash paid claims by calendar year. So you can see that we've been really paying about $300 million a year in title claims for the last five-years and just the way the actuarial triangle of work, our paid claims are going to fall over the next few years. And we think our normalized paid claim level is somewhere around $225 million and so really we’re going to have $75 million pick up in cash flow just because our paid claims are going to fall, because of the old legacy policy years become seasoned and that’s going to help us in terms of our cash flow going forward. This slide, Slide 13 speaks to our incurred claims, we get question about you know what kind of claims do you get and why they are title claims? There is always going to be title claims and this has our claim cause here in this pie chart. So 28% of our claims come from missed liens and we could miss a lien our home equity loan for a whole variety of reasons. It might not be in the public records, the lender might not have recorded the lien properly and there are always reasons why we can miss liens. That’s where most of our claims come from, 13% come from encumbrance issues, basic risks is 29% that’s like fraud and forgery, about 10% of our claims come from fraud and forgery, could be because of zoning related issues and then escrow and closing represents 3% of our claims. We could maybe miss calculate the pro rata taxes on a transaction for example. So on the right you can see that 56% of our claims come from our direct operations and 44% from our agency operations, two-thirds are from lender policies, one-third owners policies and then one thing we've done is, we look at where the claims come in terms of our process. And roughly half of the claims that we get, there is no apparent processing error. In other words, if we had to underwrite it all over again there is really nothing we would have done differently. Again, maybe the public records are just wrong, if the public records are wrong there is nothing that we can really do internally. The other 50% of the claims come from our own processing errors, whether it’s our search or examination or maybe an escrow detail. So we really have a tight interlinking between claims and underwriting to make sure that we continually learn and get feedbacks, so we can improve our claims experience going forward. I’ll talk a little bit about our emerging data strategy, we’re really combining data analytics and services to do three things, help our clients lower risk, help them create efficiencies and help them realize share gains. And that’s what we’re really focused on and we’re not just doing this for our external lender customers, but we’re also doing this internally. Our own company First American Title is the biggest use of our own – of our data. And so you can see on the top here, the markets that we are serving are Title Insurance, First American being the biggest company, but we also sell data to all the other major title underwriters and a lot of the agencies that are out there and we also sell into the real estate and mortgage finance channel, primarily through lenders and those are the key markets. And we sell our data and information from acquisition, underwriting, close, capital markets all the way through that lender value chain. And at the bottom you can see the three areas in our business that we’re really selling those products through; one is database solutions, which is really our title plans information as well as our property characteristic information. The second is Interthinx which is an acquisition that we did back in March, we bought that company for a $155 million and the integration is going extremely well, better than our expectations, we’ve merged the sales forces, we’re going in and selling our suite of solutions together and it’s been a very smooth transition. But basically what Interthinx does is they help lenders get closer and closer to the holy [grail] (ph) providing a defect free mortgage. Lenders, if they are going to sell a loan in the secondary market, they want to make sure that the income is validated, the collateral is validated, the title policies in place. They need to check all the boxes before they sell the loan to the secondary market and Interthinx helps them get comfort around those processes. And then finally First American mortgage solutions is really our centralized business where we sell to lenders, it’s primarily refinance focused, but its title, escrow and valuation services that we sell directly to lenders and again most of that’s on the refinance side. In terms of our complementary businesses, we listed few of them here we've got a strong international presence. International is about 12% of our revenue and most of our international businesses in the UK we've got a very strong presence in the UK, we really started the title insurance business in Canada about 15-years ago and we've got very good relationships with the five major banks in Canada that do the mortgage lending. We are also have a business in the UK and Australia, so we’re really in the British Commonwealth countries that have good mortgage systems and good legal systems and our international division we feel is a good growth opportunity for us. We are in home warranty, we’re the second largest home warranty company, we've got very consistent attractive ROEs. ROEs are very attractive and there is not volatile. The very seasonal business, home warranty does not do well in the summer time when there is a lot of air conditioners that go out, but in the winter time when there is less air conditioner that go out, we do well. So its sort of counter seasonal to our title business, but a very good company and we’re growing at mid-to-high single-digits today. We've got a P&C company, we do primarily homeowner insurance in the South Western U.S., we've got an 85% renewal rate and very attractive combined ratios in our P&C business. First American professional real estate services, it’s really a collection of businesses that really provide products and services and software to agents and other customers and its very complementary to what we do on the title insurance side. And then finally, we have bank, its called First American Trust that we push certain of our deposits to, we've have got $2 billion of demand deposit in the bank and again its good returns on capital with very low risk that we have take on the bank. We don’t write loans, we don’t write mortgages, it’s really a captive bank and we end up buying mortgages on the asset side. So our capital management strategy, this slide is very consistent, we really haven’t changed it over the last several years, because it really hasn’t changed. Our objective is to create long-term shareholder value. That’s the objective. Our objective isn’t to maximize our growth rate, its not to maximize EPS, it’s to create long-term shareholder value so that’s what we are focused on. And how do we do that? Well the first priority that we have is, we want to make value creating investments in our core business. We spend about $80 million a year in capital expenditures and that’s about as much as we can spend responsibly; and so that’s going to be the first priority, is growing and investing in our core business to the extent that the investments make sense from a financial perspective. The second priority that we have is to acquire businesses that enhance our core and strengthen our competitive position. Historically First American has really grown through acquisitions. About five-years ago we really turned off the acquisitions ticket, because we wanted to improve our structure and our operating processes and now we feel like we have a very efficient structure and we want to flow more orders through our pipes. And so I think we’ll do more acquisitions over the next five-years than we've done over the last five-years, but it has to have a very strong strategic intent and we have-to-have a good return on capital and then if those two conditions exist we’ll take a look at it. The two areas that I think are more likely than that are; one is title agencies in the top four states that we’re focused on, California, Texas, New York, Florida and the second area is products that we can sell to our key customers including our lenders that we don’t currently have in our portfolio, appraisal is one of those. Our third priority is to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We've talked about the dividend earlier in the presentations, but we’re paying roughly 40% of our earnings in dividends and we’re going to continue to payout a substantial portion of our earnings in dividends and it will be very opportunistic with respect to share repurchases, but we’re very committed to returning capital to shareholders over time. We want to maintain A minus financial strength ratings, its important for our commercial business, its important for our international business, its important for the cost of capital as the holding company to maintain strong ratings. Especially in this market where our clients especially our commercial clients are more focused on counter-party credit risk than they have been historically. We want to manage our capital structure prudently and we always want to make sure we have ample flexibility at the holding company which we currently have today. So that’s really our strategy in a nutshell. On Page 20 – sorry Page 17, we can see that we've really used our cash flow to grow the business and to return capital to shareholders. On the left side is our dividend, our dividends per share since 2010. Now our dividend per share have grown at a 52% annual rate, and that’s not sustainable, in 2010 we really set the dividend at a fairly low rate, simply because there were a lot of risks in the market, in 2010 we were sort of a new public company. Our margins weren’t really where we needed them to be, but now the market is better, our margins are much better and we’ve really increased the dividend significantly, we doubled it in 2012 and we double it again in 2014. So we don’t have a goal of raising the dividend every single year regardless of marketing conditions. That’s not the goal, but we do want to payout a substantial portion of our earnings in dividends. We’re currently trading at about a 3.4% dividend yield, which is as high as its been in the recent times. The middle chart there shows our free cash flow and our free cash flows improved tremendously since 2010 and 2011 when it about $67 million, $68 million, now we’re running roughly $300 million of free cash flow. And cash flow of course is lumpy, but this is one of the things that we've looked at when we set the dividend, because we’re generating a lot more cash flow now than we have in the past. And as I mentioned before, on the claim slide is we feel confident that earnings are going to rise over time and the cash flow is going to rise faster than earnings, simply because our paid claims are going to start to fall down. So we would expect a higher trajectory in terms of free cash flow over the next three-years to five-years. Our balance sheet is very healthy, it’s very clean on the asset side, we’re very liquid, we've got $1 billion of cash. Not all of that is free cash, in fact very little of it is free cash. We have a bank that has liquidity requirements and therefore a lot of that cash [strengthen] (ph) our bank, a lot of that cash is used for capital for our insurance subsidiaries both domestically and internationally, but today we've got about $130 million of I would call it free cash at the holding company and the rest is really regulated subs. And we have a $3.5 billion investment portfolio, so its very liquid side of the balance sheet. On the liabilities we've got demand deposits of $2 billion which is in our bank, we've got reserves of about a $1 billion, our debt to capital ratio is 15% and we’ve got roughly $1 billion of statutory surplus in our primary underwriting. Our investment portfolio you can see here, it’s very safe, clean and investment portfolio, we have – 49% of our assets are in government agency MBS. Our banks since we don’t write loans and we don’t write mortgages, our bank have to have at least 65% of their assets in mortgages and so that’s why we are [overweigh] (ph) government MBS. And in terms of the fixed income rating, you could see 65% of our assets are AAA, 15% AA, 9% A. Recently we’ve taken more risk in the investment portfolio, we've started to buy bank loans, we started to go into emerging market debt, but at the end of day we’re still very clean, very safe, very liquid investment portfolio. So our considerations here just to summarize, we’re a pure play, we've got a very good competitive position, we’re gaining market share, we’ve made structural cost reductions that are really going to help our earnings growth and trajectory going forward, get a very strong financial position, very healthy balance sheet and we've got a meaningful opportunity to return capital to shareholders and we've proven that that’s a priority for us. So with that being said, I thank you for your time and would be happy to entertain any question that anybody has.
Jeremy E. Campbell: Yes, I’ll kick it off with that. Mark you mentioned you guys run into about 10% pretax title margin, especially if you’re adjusting for the reserve build in 2Q, can you just comment at all about what 3Q margins could look like and then maybe what margins may look like in a more normalized type of origination environment.
Mark E. Seaton: Well, typically the second quarter and the third quarter margins are very similar, just because it is your seasonally strong quarter. Fourth quarter its typically less in the summer, because you are not getting that the spring summer selling season, but in the fourth quarter you have got a very strong commercial quarter. So I would – you know we don’t give quarterly guidance, but I think generally speaking if you look over history Q2 and Q3 have been somewhere in the range of each other and I don’t think there is any reason to believe that wouldn’t be the case this year. In terms of normalized margins, its difficult to say, because in order to come up with the normalized margin you have to come up with the normalized market and that’s kind of the tough thing, but the only thing I would say is that we’re running at a 10% margin right now and we’re still on a very depressed market, I mean the purchase originations which is our core business are very depressed levels and its going to take years of double-digit growth to get back to a normalized market. And we feel like it’s not a matter of if we have record margins and I'm talking you know low-teens even mid-teens. It’s just a matter of when. And so we are not operating just kind of sitting on our hand waiting for the market to get better, I mean we are constantly thinking strategically and cutting cost where we can and figuring out to grow where we can, but the fact of the matter is when we do hit a more normalized market we’re going to see margins that we haven’t seen before in the history of the company.
Jeremy E. Campbell: And then you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but you know clearly the commercial market showed significant strength over the past few years and it looks like when we look ahead we have kind of a wall of CMBS maturities. Do you expect continued strength to kind of persist for the next few years and maybe just some comments around that?
Mark E. Seaton: Yes, we think that the commercial market is definitely on a stronger side right now, its stronger than the normalized commercial market, but that being said we feel like we've got at least another two-years, three-years of stronger than normal market based on the CMBS maturities. And just based on the fact that you know when we talk to our customers there is a lot of capital in the side lines, people are looking for yield and real estate is a very attractive investment opportunity. So we have good reason to believe that the next couple of years are going to be – continue to be strong in commercial. We don’t expect 30% growth rate like we've had before, but if we get mid-single digit growth rate that would be very good for us, because we have very good earnings on the commercial side and again we've got very good people on a good platform and a very good comparative position. So it’s very difficult to break into on the commercial market and we haven’t seen a new national commercial player in many years. So we’re very well very positioned strategically there.
Jeremy E. Campbell: And then you also touched on use of capital and potential pursuing acquisitions other products that you don’t currently operate now like appraisal. What are some examples of some other type of products that you may be looking to extend into?
Mark E. Seaton: Well, the appraisal product is one, its high on our list and when I say that we've been really talking about that for at least a year now, we still haven’t purchased anything, because we don’t need it. I mean if we never bought an appraisal business we would be just fine strategically, but the fact is that a lot of lenders they like to buy title and appraisal together. Now a lot of our lenders – customers are asking us to provide them a valuation solution. So when I mentioned appraisal, it’s not just traditional appraisal where you send the appraiser out the house and like an appraisal management company type business, its everything from that to automotive appraisals, to broker priced opinion, its valuation through the whole spectrum and so I think that whether its appraisal or BPO or AVM that’s a solution that we need to strengthen over time. Outside of that there is not a whole lot of product that we look at and say that we really need this to strengthen our position. We like where we sit in that right now.
Jeremy E. Campbell: And what does the market look like to appraisal or BPO type companies?
Mark E. Seaton: Fairly fragmented, there is no real public companies out there that do that but there is a host of private companies that do BPOs, they do traditional appraisal and I would say its more fragmented than a lot of the other markets that are out there. So again, we’re going to be very disciplined about it and we will only do it if it make sense and the right fit and we can get it for the right price.
Jeremy E. Campbell: And then just finally here, certainly you guys have used book value as a bit of buyback threshold. I know you have big authorization and you are going to be having all this extra capital come through your free cash flow, but is there an appetite to buyback shares above book value going forward?
Mark E. Seaton: Well what we look at for buybacks is we don’t really – we look at DCF in terms of like what prices we’re going to buy it back, so the first thing we look at is discount cash flows. The second thing we look at is sort of a normalized earnings approach evaluation and those are the two methods primarily the DCF that we really use to evaluate whether or not we should be buying back our stock. Now we also look at book value and we look at PE, and we look at tangible book value as sort of check, but we don’t have a formula that says as soon as stock gets under book value we will buy it back. There might be times when the stock is above book value that we would buy it back. There might be times when it’s below book value that we wouldn’t buy it back. And it also depends on other investment opportunities that we have and the returns of those investment opportunities. So I wish it was as simple to say if its 0.99 we buy it back it just – it’s not the case. Now last year we bought $65 million of stock and it just happen to be slightly below book, but it was a more of a coincidence than anything else, but again we like buybacks and we've done over the past, we have capacity to do that both financially and with our buyback authorization, but we really look at kind of the DCF approach more than anything else.
Jeremy E. Campbell: Well with that I would just like everybody to join me in thanking First American for coming out.
Mark E. Seaton: Thanks for having us."
