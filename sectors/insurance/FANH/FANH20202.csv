The number of performing sales agents grew 7.2% quarter-to-quarter to 35,000. We are also glad to see positive growth in per agent FYP among performing agents, per policy premiums and active ratio among new recruits. In the second quarter of 2020, Fanhua has maintained excellent business quality with 13 months persistency ratio reaching 92% and 25 months renewal rate exceeding 87%. In the second quarter of 2020, our whole life insurance business continued its growth momentum in the last quarter becoming a new growth point for the company. Our whole life insurance business increased 669.1% year-on-year, taking up 19.4% of our life insurance business in terms of APE in the second quarter of 2020 compared to only 2.1% in the same period of 2019. On the other hand, the proportion of our critical illness insurance business decreased slightly to 68.8% from 73.7% in the second quarter of 2019 and our annuity insurance business decreased from 20.9% to 9.1% as the percentage of our total life insurance business. In the second quarter of 2020, we have continued close cooperation with our product suppliers and devoted ourselves to providing customers with the most competitive and diversified products. Compared to the same period last year, we have added five new suppliers for long-term insurance products. Currently, Fanhua has established headquarter to headquarter partnerships with 35 insurance companies for the distribution of long-term insurance products. In the second quarter of 2020, our top five life insurance partners were Sinatay Life Insurance, Huaxia Life Insurance, Evergrande Life Insurance, Aeon Life Insurance and Tian'an Life Insurance, which accounted for 30.8%, 16.7%, 16.6%, 40.3% and 6.7%, respectively, as our life insurance segment in terms of APE. Up to now, the contract terms in our cooperation with these major product suppliers has remained stable. Breakthrough growth in claim adjusting business since Fanhua began to tap into the medical insurance related claim adjusting business in its plan adjusting segment in 2019, we have achieved breakthrough growth which contributed to the rapid increase of our claim adjusting revenue.

Meanwhile, based on the big data analysis, Fanhua is also working on data mining and stratification to help our agents to further cultivate our customer resources and improve their productivity. Business guidelines [ph]. Despite the headwind from COVID-19 on China’s macro economy and the insurance markets, Fanhua still delivered solid results that beat our prior estimate in the second quarter of 2020, fully demonstrating the sustainability and resilience of our business model. As the pandemic gets further contained in China, we have full confidence in achieving year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter positive growth in GWP, total net revenue, APE and non-GAAP operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses in the third quarter of 2020. We firmly believe that after coming out from the COVID-19, supported with upgraded strategy and empowered by our digital capability and elite sales force, Fanhua will be able to increase for a higher quality and rapid development. Dividend for the second quarter of 2020 is $0.25 per ADS payable around September 8, 2020 to shareholders of record on September 22, 2020. Fanhua remains committed to returning cash in terms of quarterly dividends to shareholders. This concludes my presentation. Now the floor will open for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We have our first questions from the line of Xue, Yuan of CICC. Please go ahead.
Yuan Xue: This is Xue, Yuan from CICC and he has two questions and the first one regarding to the breakdown of our newer business as a percentage of our total gross profit? And the second question, how did our business look like in July and August? What’s the growth?
Chunlin Wang: So basically, the contribution from new business and renewal business to our gross profit is about 50-50. And to be specific, the gross profit derived from new business accounts for about 49.7% of our total gross profit, while that from renewal business has taken up about 50.3%. And up to now, our APE in July and August, those recorded positive growth and we believe that we will deliver a positive quarter.
Yuan Xue: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for the questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Chu of Franklin Templeton. Please go ahead.
Michael Chu: Two questions from Michael. The first one is why our renewal premiums dropped sequentially? And the second question is with regard to the strong sales of our whole life insurance business in the second quarter for Fanhua. Is there any particular reason for that? And as far as he sees, it seems that the whole life insurance product didn’t sell very well in the second quarter in the whole insurance industry. So is that because our product suppliers have provided very good products in terms of design in the second quarter?
Chunlin Wang: So our renewal premiums grew by about 36.7% in the second quarter this year. And the reason for the sequential decline was because usually our life insurance business was the highest in the first quarter due to seasonality. So that may result in the sequential decline. Why? Because the base in the second quarter last year was different compared with the first quarter last year. You may know that there has been some restrictions on the designs of the product – for annuity products since last year. And right now we’re actually seeing very good window of opportunities for us to develop whole life insurance products. Our insurance company partners also see this good opportunities. Therefore, we have been set up cooperation in this regard expanding sales, expanding our efforts to innovate products for whole life insurance products. So that’s one of the major reasons that drive the strong sales of whole life in the second quarter. In terms of the ticket size, the per policy premiums for whole life and annuity are more or less similar. And in the second quarter, the whole life – the per policy premium is slightly higher than annuity. Thank you.
Michael Chu: How does Fanhua’s whole life insurance product differentiate against our competitors? And who is the major supplier for our whole life insurance products? And then secondly, in light of the kind of restriction by the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government on Chinese ADR companies, how company is going to do about that and has the U.S. regulators provided any kind of guidelines to Fanhua?
Chunlin Wang: In terms – our major products suppliers for whole life insurance products are Sinatay and Aeon Life Insurance. For – product wise, there may not be a huge difference compared to most of the popular whole life products in the market, but I think one of the major difference is that our product suppliers offer more aggressive sales incentives in the second quarter to boost the sales. Since our IPO in 2007, Fanhua has been preparing and comparing our financial statements in accordance with the U.S. GAAP and we have strictly followed the rules and regulations by the SEC and the stock exchanges to conduct information disclosure in a transparent, open and complete manner. We will try all means to keep compliance with all the rules and regulations that’s helpful to increase the transparency and helpful for protecting the investors’ interest. As for the ad and the proposal by the working [ph] group, I think the implementation still – there is still some kind of uncertainty, but we’ll certainly keep close watch on that. As for whether or not Fanhua will consider relisting in Hong Kong or in Mainland China, I think if there is good opportunity, we will not rule out that possibility. However, I don’t think we will spend a lot of energies on that. We still believe that a company, a good quality company, especially one with sustainable dividend policies will be applauded or will be appreciated by investors wherever it is listed. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Mr. Chu, any follow-up questions?
Oasis Qiu: Thank you. If you have any further follow-up questions – sorry, is there any?
Michael Chu: No. Thanks very much.
Oasis Qiu: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for the questions. We have no more questions from the line. I’d like to hand the call back to management for closing.
Oasis Qiu: Please feel free to come through to Investor Relations if any of you have any follow-up questions. Thank you for participating in today’s conference call. Have a nice day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."
