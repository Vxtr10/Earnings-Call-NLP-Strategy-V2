I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today's conference, Ms. Oasis Qiu, Fanhua's Investor Relations Manager. Please go ahead.
Oasis Qiu: Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The earnings results were released earlier today and are available on our IR website as well as on Newswire.
Chunlin Wang: Thank you for joining us on today's conference call. Here with me, we have our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Peng Ge. We will begin today's call with an overview of our third quarter 2020 financial and operational results and share with you an update on our recent strategic initiatives. Mr. Ge and I will take your questions after the report. Part 1, financial results in the third quarter of 2020. I would like to start with a brief review of our third quarter financial results. In the third quarter of 2020, Fanhua's life insurance business grew 15.5% year-on-year in gross written premiums to CNY 2.4 billion, outpacing the industry growth rate. Renewal premiums exceeded CNY 1.8 billion, while first year premiums reached CNY 582.7 million. And annualized premiums equivalent reached CNY 333.5 million. New business growth was below our previous expectation, mainly due to the following factors. One, there has been an adverse impact of the pandemic on customers' purchasing power and consumption sentiment. Second, our agency expansion plan was put on hold due to the pandemic, and as a result, cannot bring incremental growth as previously expected. Third, in recent years, insurance agents' average income has dropped below socio average level in China, and the gap is still widening, thus, posing considerable difficulties on agent recruitment and resulting in low agent retention rate across the industry. Fourth, as 2020 is the last year of the 3-year financial rectification initiative in China, small- and medium-sized insurance companies lacked incentives on product innovation. In contrast, major insurance companies have taken more aggressive product strategies, overshadowing the competitiveness of the products offered by small- and medium-sized insurance companies.
Operator: . The first question we have is from the line of Yuan Xue from CICC.
Yuan Xue: There are two questions from Xue Yuan. The first question is regarding the opening years -- the year-opening sales strategy for Fanhua. How are we prepared for that year opening sales? And the second question is actually regarding a common issue that's faced by the overall industry. It seems that protection-oriented products have encountered huge difficulties in sales. When do you expect the recovery will happened?
Chunlin Wang: For the year opening sales in 2021, it's actually the first time that we attached a special attention to year opening sales in the past decade. So we want to make sure that we are fully prepared for this, and we have also a little bit high expectation for the year opening results. So we set up a special team, a special task force in charge of the year opening sales preparation. We believe that the opening sales will produce very good results in 2021, and we'll also -- some good starting point for our work in 2021. We believe that year opening sales will help stabilize the team better and help enhance their confidence as well as to further enhance our leading position in the industry. The good results from year opening sales were also from a good foundation for our execution of the new strategies in 2021.
Operator: . The next question we have is from the line of Auyeung Frank from Morgan Stanley.
Frank Auyeung: There are two questions from Auyeung. The first question is regarding to the revenue model with regard to our cloud service plan, things we're going to establish more closer cooperation with some third parties under this cloud service plan. And the second question is regarding to our dividend guidance for 2021.
Chunlin Wang: I would like to answer the first question regarding to cloud service plan. We have attached great importance to this plan actually. In the past two years, we have made a lot of preparation; and actually, we have done some trial -- some pilot project this year, which produced 20 million APE as a result. So we expect to further expand this plan to wider market players this year -- next year. Currently, our new business gross margin is about 25%. So on top of this maintaining this gross margin, we're going to execute on our cloud service plan. Recently, a senior manager who used to be in charge of the intermediary insurance business in Taikang Life joined Fanhua, who will be in charge of our cloud service operations. He has huge experience, extensive experience in insurance intermediary sector and have a good understanding of the products and services in the insurance intermediary sectors as well. And he has also -- have former experience in signing contracts with at least 400 to 500 small- and medium-sized insurance intermediaries and technology platforms as well as key opinion leaders.
Operator: We don't have any further question at this time. . And we don't have any further questions at this time. I'll now pass the conference back to Ms. Oasis Qiu for closing remarks.
Oasis Qiu: Thank you, Rishi. Thank you for joining today's conference call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us. Thank you.
