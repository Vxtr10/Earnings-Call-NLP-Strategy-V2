Chunlin Wang: Thank you for joining us on today's conference call. Here with me, we have our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Peng Ge, and our Board Secretary, Lily Lee. On today's call, I will share with you our new strategy initiatives and some key progress, followed by our financial forecast for 2021. Mr. Ge and I will take your questions after the report. Part one, in 2021 while the China's life insurance industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, Fanhua will still protect and maintain healthy development. In 2020, despite the continued challenges from COVID-19, Fanhua accomplished another major milestone with our gross written premiums on regular life insurance business exceeding RMB10 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 16.3% and our operating profit reaching RMB300 million. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the gross written premiums of our regular life insurance business increased 21% year-over-year to RMB2.9 billion, operating profit reached RMB71.9 million, exceeding our previous expectations. Now to our strategy assessment. First, although the growth of China's life insurance market slowed down in '20 due to the impact from COVID-19 pandemic, we still believe that China's life insurance industry will maintain a long-term rapid growth trends unchanged. And that the development of insurance intermediaries will be faster than that of the insurance industry as a whole.
Operator:  Our first question comes from the line of Chi Chung  from CICC. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Two questions from Chi Chung, CICC. The first question is with regard our guidance on the GWP of our regular life insurance business in the first quarter, which sounds quite strong growth. She's wondering whether this strong performance is due to the transition of the critical illness definition framework. And then after the new critical illness framework transition in February the 1st, how is the sales of the new critical illness products so far?
Chunlin Wang: Firstly, in the first quarter, after the new critical illness Fanhua take effects, the jumpstart sales compounds in the first quarter. And the industry has actually been performing pretty well. Largely thanks to the transition of the critical illness Fanhua transition. And for us, for Fanhua, we believe that we have been outperforming the industry. It has been an industrial norm that each time after a major regulation or a policy issue, which resulted a change to insurance products. It will have of cause a huge impact on the industry. We do expect that after the transition of the critical illness framework, it will probably take the industry some time to fully recover. We've been proceeding with the transition of the products schedule, and we've been making preparations for our next marketing campaigns, which is in April and June and May. For the next marketing campaign, our major products will focus on annuity and whole life products, while we will also make efforts to educate our customers on the new critical illness products. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator:  There's no more question at this time. Our speakers you may continue.
