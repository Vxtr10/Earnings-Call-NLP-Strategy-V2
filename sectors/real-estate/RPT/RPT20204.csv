Brian Harper: Good morning, and thank you for joining our Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. I hope you and your families are all well. 2020 will be a year not soon forgotten. The health and economic impacts from COVID-19 have been unprecedented. Add to this, the social and political unrest our country has experienced in 2020, will no doubt go down as one of the most historic and difficult years in our lifetime. While the issues facing an open air shopping center REIT are small in comparison to 2020’s broader challenges, I am proud of RPT’s response and execution this past year. From our tenant assistance program and charitable donations, to our property level safety and curbside pickup initiatives, RPT demonstrated its commitment to our purpose of turning commercial ground into common ground. We also took swift and decisive actions to shore up our liquidity and preserve our access to capital with our first-time investment grade credit rating from Fitch. In addition, I was very pleased with the team's tireless effort in pursuit of rent collections, which improved to 91% in the fourth quarter. Following the payoff of our remaining $100 million balance on our revolver, we have over $100 million of cash, and a fully undrawn $350 million revolver, and are now positioned to take full advantage of our unique and valuable partnership with GIC, and opportunistically execute on our external growth plans. We continue to track a healthy pipeline of acquisitions, and have started to see some improvement in activity in recent weeks.  Let me just reemphasize that the underlying real estate is the primary driver of our acquisition strategy. What we then look for is growth. That could come in a variety of ways, from undermarket rents and mismanaged assets, to redevelopment opportunities. It could also come in a variety of different retail formats, from grocery-anchored lifestyle centers, power centers, to community centers. As previously reported, we had five deals in our GIC venture either signed or in negotiations in February of 2020. Once the pandemic hit, we and our partners made the decision to get out of all of them. We are now fortunate to have the liquidity and the deep pipeline within our core markets, and believe the widening value gap between property types, tenant categories, and markets, is creating differentiated opportunities that we hope to take advantage of in 2021. 
Mike Fitzmaurice: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter results, our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, and end with commentary to help everyone understand our expectations on how our business will trend in 2021. Fourth quarter operating FFO per share of $0.18, was consistent last quarter, and again, largely driven by rent not probable of collection that I will refer to as bad debt throughout my prepared remarks for simplicity. For the fourth quarter, our bad debt and abatements were $4.4 million, about the same as the third quarter. We reserved about 89% of our uncollected fourth quarter recurring billings, leaving limited downside from these categories relative to our fourth quarter run rates. As of year-end, $18.1 million of recurring billings for the period of April through December 2020, remain outstanding, of which $11.9 million had been reserved. We expect most of the unreserved amount of $6.2 million to be paid back over the course of 2021 and 2022. We continue to be quite pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and our limited bankruptcy exposure, as our at lease rate of 92.8% held up well in the quarter, down just 50 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by the recapture of our two Stein Mart leases that I noted last quarter. Blended rent spreads for the quarter remained positive at 3.4%, impacted by a few flat strategic renewals. Also, it's important to note that the releasing spread is just one factor in the organic growth profile.  The other factor that we heavily weigh in lease negotiations, are the annual contractual rent increases. The leases that we signed during the quarter, annual contractual rent increases, were about 150 basis points, which is a key contributor to creating a long-term sustainable NOI growth profile. As we have noted consistently, we expect some volatility in our quarterly statistics, given the size of our portfolio, but see a continued mark-to-market opportunity as we cycle legacy leases over the next few years. And as Brian noted in his remarks regarding dividend policy, we have placed a premium on free cash flow, allowing us to utilize our cheapest form of capital to take advantage of these opportunities, as we re-stabilize our portfolio to pre-COVID lease rate levels of nearly 95%. 
Operator:  Our first question is coming from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Derek Johnston: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Can we get a deeper update on external growth? Specifically, what are you seeing in private market pricing, also strip investor appetite? And then secondly, we’re in a new year here. Where are you hoping to add property profile wise or market wise? And then, what's the mix between on-balance sheet versus additions to the GIC JV, and any reason you guys didn't give acquisition guidance, since it's such a big part of the story?
Brian Harper: Yes. Hi, Derek. Let me hit the first update. What we're seeing from acquisitions, obviously a lot of deals did not trade in 2020. Certainly a lot of deals north of $50 million in the retail ecosystem didn't trade. We have seen a lot of loosening up from that perspective, and that's from private individuals. That’s from larger private companies, and that's from institutions. I’ll say, largely, we're not much of a mark-on-marketed deal buyer. We liked the true off-market. We have been sourcing the deals for over this past year. And really, as I said in my prepared remark, had a huge pipeline pre-pandemic of $700 million, with five deals under contract in February that we bowed out. I think the important thing that I want to put framework around is, we're a bottom up IRR company, and we're here to drive value and achieve the highest risk adjusted returns. I do want to emphasize, and this goes into our not providing guidance. We will continue to be disciplined and patient. There’s obviously a lot of uncertainty, and we are extremely disciplined on our underwriting, and don't want to do this quarter-to-quarter guidance of acquisitions, as opposed to providing a full year guidance. I think the mix of balance sheet versus GIC will be mixed. There's a lot of arbitrage to be had, and a lot of property types that might be maybe too frothy, and some might have opportunities to have that value added risk adjusted return. So we see that as a blend, a really good blend of both balance sheet and GIC. And I can't emphasize just the partnership with GIC. They've been nothing but terrific. We're talking all the time, and they're bringing us opportunities, as obviously we're bringing them opportunities.
Derek Johnston: Okay. No, thank you, Brian. Very insightful. Can we talk a bit about tenant demand? How do you feel about current leasing activity, and where is your pipeline now versus pre-COVID? I know you shared in the open remarks where it was versus last quarter, but how about versus pre-COVID? And then secondly, how could you describe your portfolio-wide mark-to-market opportunity, given the leasing demand you see today?
Brian Harper: Yes, thanks. Statistically, I would say we're not quite back to 100% of the inquiries and tours that we were seeing pre-pandemic. Some companies are not flying yet, both from the retailers, but it's improved dramatically over the last two quarters. We feel qualitatively, the activity we're seeing feels more transactional, with more genuine interest and a higher conversion rate with the tenants we are in dialogue now with, as opposed to even last quarter or the quarter before. I do think our suburban portfolio with grocers and high volume off price tenants, mixed with the good geography, demos, et cetera, is driving demand. And there's always going to be a flight to quality. And as you've heard from me even pre-COVID, there was a flight from malls, and that's something we continue to see a lot more of. And as we've been strict with not just filling up space, is curating to the right merchandising mix, and really staying true to service in essential businesses, what that mall interest is, it's creating friction in the market, and that helps drive spreads. That helps drive competing tenants to higher rents. So, I've been very, very pleased with the results from leasing. I mean, it's a very healthy backlog of SNL of 3.2 million today, with 1.8 million in lease negotiations, with a lot behind that, and call it LOIs or proposals or advanced negotiations. So I mean, from coming out of a pandemic and really looking at our 2019 levels of SNL that led to a sector-leading 4.1% NOI growth, I'm feeling extremely pleased. 
Mike Fitzmaurice: And Derek, from a mark-to-market perspective and the rest of our portfolio, we've only about - cycled through about 30% of the portfolio since we've been here since mid-2018. We still do see a significant opportunity there over the last 12 months or so. Our new lease and spreads have about 20 - been above 20% on a blended basis. And we do see that number continuing over time as we continue to cycle through the remaining part of the portfolio. And just from a leasing volume perspective as well, to answer your question straight on, we do expect from a deal comp perspective, for new leases to be up about 50% relative to ’19 - or I'm sorry, relative to ‘20, which is on par with what we did in 2019. 
Brian Harper: And Derek, one more thing just to bring into the weeds, which I like to do is, just to give you some more context of some legacy leases. We have a huge push on these grocer initiatives, and what we're now seeing too from home improvement and wholesale clubs, really to bring that essential mix into the cash flows. We have two legacy leases that were expiring in two years. We were proactive with them. We are finalizing a lease that is out for signature today with a first-to-market major grocer. That grocer deal over the prior legacy leases, was a 66% spread. Like that is the opportunity within this portfolio. And I could say that's a power center. So that's a huge value creation, not only from isolating the deal by itself, but the cap rate compression and the overall deal valuation. So we're seeing that across the board. 
Derek Johnston: Thank you, Brian and Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Todd Thomas: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to circle back first to the acquisitions, and I guess the GIC venture specifically. Can you just remind us how investments were to be split between RPT and the venture, and have the parameters changed at all for the venture, the scope of what the joint venture is willing to buy relative to RPT?
Brian Harper: Yes. I mean, I think first and foremost, it's a partnership and we're talking more now than we ever have and even prior to COVID, we were talking a lot. And again, it's an unbelievable partnership where I couldn't be happier. Really the venture was set up to really focus on grocery centers. They have a ROFO for any grocery center over $25 million in the top 75 MSAs. With that said, would they look at other asset types within the retail world? Yes. And I'm not saying that's something we wouldn't do, but something that we're being very mindful of is obviously the balance sheet, growing that as well as our relationship with GIC.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And going forward, do you anticipate - will the venture primarily be structured the same as it was when it was initially formed with your share being 51.5%, or is that expected to potentially change for future investments here?
Brian Harper: We’re looking at a lot of options. I mean, I think the thing that we love with them is, there's just great flexibility. So it's - listen, obviously there's - you look at it from a lens of single assets or a small portfolio to large portfolios, which would maybe be a less of an ownership interest. So it’s just - love about them is their global reach, their strategic minds, but also their flexibility towards the partnership.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And Mike, I think you said the guidance does not include acquisitions, but there's an expectation that the $100 million of cash on the balance sheet will be deployed during the year. Is that right? And then, are there any asset sales being contemplated? Are you looking to monetize any properties in 2021, potentially some parcels or individual assets?
Mike Fitzmaurice: No, good question, Todd. And no, there's no transactions embedded into our guidance range on the disposition front, nor the acquisition front. So if we were to go out, which is our intention to redeploy the $100 million in two acquisitions, that's going to be upside to our range of $0.77 to $0.87.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And you do expect to deploy $100 million during ’21? Is that correct?
Mike Fitzmaurice: Yes. I think at this point, timing is the biggest variant, right? So that's why we’re a bit hesitant on putting it within the guidance range, just given the pandemic that we're still currently experiencing. But if I had to guess, I would say that the $100 million would be redeployed in the second half of this year.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And are there any asset sales being contemplated at all? 
Mike Fitzmaurice: No. 
Todd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. 
Craig Schmidt: Great. Thank you. Regarding the new groceries that you're looking at, are they looking at picking new space by converting parking lots, or are they replacing existing space?
Brian Harper: Hey, Craig, these would be all taking existing space. We don't have any grocers doing ground up in the parking lot. So what I love about this is just huge value creation. And I would say the majority of these grocers would be taking space within power centers. They want simply the best-in-class grocers, which you can count on one hand. They want the best real estate, and they don't mind if it's replacing a former grocer, to a power center, to potentially a freestanding location.
Craig Schmidt: And are you able to raise rent in the examples you're working on?
Brian Harper: Yes. So the example I gave you where we have a deal out for signature in one of our core markets, these were legacy leases of two tenants. We're combining those two spaces for this first-to-market major grocer. That spread, Craig, is 66%.
Craig Schmidt: And how - and I guess you did two strategic deals in the fourth quarter, which kind of lowered the leasing spreads. Do you think at the end of the year, you'll be closer to your high single digit, low digit, low double digit rate? 
Brian Harper: Yes, I would think that. I mean, it's - I think this is - it’s always tough to track spreads quarter-to-quarter. We had obviously monster spreads last quarter, and these spreads were moderate, and really were dragged down just by a couple of strategic deals that we did on a portfolio with a tenant where we just thought it was best to renew short-term flat as to take the vacancy. So yes, that would be my guess right now of that, those high single level digits.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks guys. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about - Brian, you're always talking about IRR-driven. What are the spreads investing opportunities you have in your portfolio, and how much potential ground rents could you - do you have in the portfolio that you could harvest and redeploy into either redevelopment or new acquisitions?
Brian Harper: Thanks, Floris. So, we did update our remerchandising opportunities in the SOP. That list is long, and there's a deeper list behind that. Where I like this is, we were, we were averaging, call it mid double digit yields, when we inherited 20 boxes when we first came over to the company. We see that same opportunity with these identified cases that we listed in the SOP. Those range from infill Miami real estate opportunities, where maybe it's a wholesale or a home improvement add-on, which will obviously have huge cap rate compression, but also allow a lot of tailwind leasing to occur, to the asset that I was just referring to in one of our core markets, the grocery deal of putting that into a power center, replacing two tenants, and that's a 66% lease spread, to even the Town & Country Center In St. Louis, Whole Foods, Target, HomeGoods, where we have four active LOIs going with best-in-class retailers where there is massive demand.  So we've been sharpshooting, and we've been working on this for a while. We've been proactive with the Stein Mart boxes. For example, one's already in lease. The other one in St. Louis will probably be in lease soon as we come to conclusions on those LOIs. So we're seeing just great demand and great - especially from the junior boxes. And Mike, do you want to touch upon the ground leases? 
Mike Fitzmaurice: Yes. So the ground lease NOI we have in the portfolio today, Floris, is about $10 million or so. You ascribe a cap rate in the mid-single digits, you have $200 million of value. So reinvesting that - in these releasing opportunities that Brian just touched on, could be very, very accretive for the company. And then in addition to that, if we want to redeploy that acquisitions, there's a nice spread there as well. It's a good optionality.
Floris van Dijkum: Yes. That's - so it was around $10 million. So that's meaningful for a company your size. Maybe, could you also comment on the leasing costs that you had this past quarter? Obviously, they were - there are probably some one-offs in here, but the $75 million - sort of 75 per square foot TIs was about 50% higher than what you've averaged for the year. How was that going to trend going forward?
Brian Harper: It was high. It was heightened on one deal. Like it hit - it was a five below deal where we had a little bit of extra landlord work combining two spaces. You take that deal off and it was 44 bucks a square foot. So we see that as more of a moderate range of Tis going forward.
Floris van Dijkum: Great. Thanks. That's it for me, guys. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. 
Mike Mueller: Yes. Hi. I guess looking at the $0.075 dividend for the first quarter, was that set by the board by looking at taxable net for the first quarter, or is that based more on a full year view where you're expecting that dividend to be kind of constant throughout the year and then grow in the future years?
Brian Harper: I mean, it’s based on full year. But I can say, we set it really with obviously improved visibility and confidence in the cash flows, where we really weren’t primarily focused on retaining our cheapest form of capital, especially in light of all of that huge upside with the remerchandising opportunities that I've been talking about throughout this call, and upside in our small shop occupancy. I think balance that with the approach with setting a competitive dividend, it allows us to grow it comfortably, and even in a no growth environment. And we really set it to a level where we're retaining as much cash as we can for accretive leasing and remerchandising opportunities, and to get those double digit returns. So it will grow commensurate with earnings, and it really boils down to earnings growth and acquisitions.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. And Mike, you talked about the variability of where you could end up in the 2021 range based on theaters paying or not paying. How much of the $4.4 million reserves is tied to theaters, just ballpark?
Mike Fitzmaurice: Yes. I would say two thirds of it, Mike. I think the best way to think about it is, the clean number for the fourth quarter, ex any prior period adjustments for bad debt and abasements was about $3.7 million. If there is no change in that number throughout 2021, that would bring you to the low end of the guide for $0.77 to $0.87. If there is improvement, which is our expectation in the theater business, especially given the visibility we have and the conversations we have, especially with Regal that they will reopen in the spring, we'll begin to get back to the days of contract rent, that those collections will improve over time, thereby reducing our bad debt expectations.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. 
Linda Tsai: Hi. In terms of acquisitions, to the extent you're targeting high growth, high return markets, you noted Miami, Charlotte, Richmond, Phoenix, Orlando. How has pricing changed since pre-COVID, and are you seeing more assets come to market?
Brian Harper: We have seen much more come to market, Linda. And a lot of that is talking with, like I said, whether it's private buyers or institutions directly. I think pricing hasn't - from a cap rate, hasn't changed much. NOI has in some of these centers, not all. But we really - are really focused on assets with the undermarket rent, assets that maybe have been mismanaged, assets where we could have a redevelopment, assets potentially where we might have a grocer or a home improvement or a wholesale club in our back pocket, and could go buy a power center with doing that deal in due diligence, right?  So we're very tenant-focused, demand-focused, IRR-focused, and really focused in on those types of markets, which you saw. I could tell you, we spend a ton of time in Austin, and Lake Hills has been a home run acquisition for the company. We love Miami. We love Orlando. We love Tampa. We are seeing some tremendous opportunities, and I've spent some time in Boston and love what's going on there with especially life science. And we see that as a macro trend that will just greatly - will never leave and just will be just a great investment opportunity in that city.
Linda Tsai: Thank you. That's it for me.
Operator: Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Harper for closing comments.
Brian Harper: Thank you, everybody, and I really appreciate all the questions. The pandemic has accelerated many trends in retail that were already underway. As an owner of retail real estate, it is imperative for us to adapt quickly to the rapidly evolving environment. I do believe our focus on strategically thinking about where the future of retail is heading, and our private equity-like value creation mindset, will set RPT apart from a crowded shopping center universe, and put us at the forefront of the retail evolution. Thank you all for joining this call, and we look forward to speaking with many of you on the virtual conference circuit in the next few weeks. Have a wonderful day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Once again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time."
