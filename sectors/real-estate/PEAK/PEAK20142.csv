"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 HCP Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amanda, and I'll be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference call, John Lu, Senior Vice President. You may go ahead sir.
John Lu: Thank you, Amanda. Today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements, including those about our guidance and the financial position and operations of our tenants. These statements are made as of today's date and reflect the company's good faith beliefs and best judgment based on current information. These statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are described in our press releases and SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2013. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. Future events could render the forward-looking statements untrue, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update earlier statements as a result of new information. Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. We have provided reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures in our supplemental information package and earnings release, both of which have been furnished to the SEC today and are available on our website at www.hcpi.com. Also during the call, we will discuss certain operating metrics, including occupancy, cash flow coverage and same property performance. These metrics and other related terms are defined in our supplemental information package. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Lauralee Martin.
Lauralee E. Martin: Thank you, John, and welcome to HCP's 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Paul Gallagher, Chief Investment Officer; Tim Schoen, Chief Financial Officer; and John Lu, Investor Relations. The continued solid performance in our core portfolio, which Tim and Paul will take you through in a minute, is the result of our strong asset management capabilities and long-term investment disciplines that focus on immediate earnings accretion and continuing future growth. We at HCP congratulate Andy Smith and the Brookdale and Emeritus teams for closing their transformational merger last Thursday. With the closing of the merger, we anticipate that HCP's transaction will close on August 29. This transaction will bring improved lease coverage, a stronger [ph] credit operator and the elimination of purchase options in a competitive reinvestment marketplace, particularly for private pay senior housing assets. In addition, we are well positioned to benefit from the future growth of our CCRC and RIDEA joint ventures and we remain a strategic capital source to Brookdale by partnering with them, recognizing their desire to participate in the benefits of real estate ownership they helped create as a premier operating company. Our increased investment activities this quarter demonstrate we are making solid progress on the expansion of our deal sourcing capabilities. We continue to pursue opportunistic return investments, while also delivering midsized transactions with attractive economics. Year-to-date, we have closed investments totaling $507 million, and have an additional $600 million committed and in the closing process. These investments are across our diversified segments and include $892 million in Senior Living, $115 million in medical office buildings and $100 million in life science. Tim and Paul will be covering these transaction details shortly. These investments demonstrate we have maintained our investment discipline, which sometimes is difficult to do in today's interest rate environment. As part of our risk reward discussion, we believe quality and our strategic real estate deliver stronger returns through different economic cycles. On the international front, we first entered the U.K. health care real estate market in mid-2012 as the lead investor in the junior debt for Terra Firma's acquisition of Four Seasons Health Care. Last year, we made another debt investment in Barchester, which generated significant profit for us. We have now successfully added our first equity investment in a triple net lease with Maria Mallaband, a top 10 for-profit operator of care homes in the U.K. at an attractive 7.6% lease yield. Maria Mallaband is also an experienced developer, and we look forward to growing our relationship through future acquisitions and development opportunities. Similar to our early debt investments, this transaction has attracted market attention resulting in an active pipeline of investment opportunities in Europe. In summary, we are on track to deliver quality accretive investment growth this year despite the currently competitively priced marketplace. Let me now turn the call over to Tim to cover our financial results.
Timothy M. Schoen: Thank you, Lauralee. There are 4 topics I will cover today: results for the second quarter; investment transactions and balance sheet; Brookdale transaction update; and finally, our increased full year 2014 earnings guidance. Let me start with our second quarter results. For the quarter, we reported FFO of $0.73 per share, which included transaction costs of $0.02 per share related to our Brookdale transaction and portfolio acquisition in the U.K. Excluding these costs, FFOs adjusted for the quarter was $0.75 per share and FAD was $0.63 per share. Cash NOI from our same property portfolio increased 2.4% year-over-year. The growth was driven by contractual rent increases, offset in part by the timing of tenant hospital add [ph] rents recognized earlier in Q1 this year and lower performance from our Sunrise portfolio. Year-to-date through June, our same property portfolio generated a 3.3% cash NOI growth rate compared to the first half of 2013. Paul will discuss our results by segment in a few minutes. Turning to our investment transactions and balance sheet. We were active across our property segments during the quarter, completing total investments of $360 million, led by $304 million of acquisitions and development where we achieved a blended initial cash yield of 7%. Our second quarter investment transactions consisted of first, a GBP 76 million or $127 million acquisition of a 20 property care home portfolio in a sale-leaseback transaction with Maria Mallaband. The going-in cash lease yield during the initial year is 7.6%, and we have fixed the exchange rate by hedging 75% of contractual rents through December 2015. Second, acquisitions of 5 assets representing $158 million to expand our senior housing, life science and medical office portfolios at a blended year 1 cap rate of 6.3%, plus we committed to a $19 million new development of an on-campus MOB at a projected return on cost of 8.7%. Third, $56 million of investments in development in other capital improvements. Our credit profile and strong balance sheet continue to improve as demonstrated by several key credit metrics at the end of the second quarter. 38.9% financial leverage remained below our long-term target of 40%, with 96% financed on a fixed rate basis; 6% secured debt ratio, down from 6.8% at year end 2013; 4.8x net debt to EBITDA; and $1.7 billion of immediate liquidity from our revolver and cash balances. We have no scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of 2014. Looking ahead into 2015, debt maturities total $720 million at a blended interest rate of 6.3%, representing attractive refinancing opportunities given the current interest rate environment. Next, an update on our pending Brookdale transaction. The completion of Brookdale's merger with Emeritus last week represents a significant milestone with respect to our pending transaction with Brookdale. We now anticipate our transaction will close by the end of this month, which, as a reminder, is comprised of the creation of a sector leading $1.2 billion entrance fee CCRC joint venture and the lease amendments related to the legacy 202 Emeritus communities that reflect lower future rents from Brookdale valued at $207 million. In exchange, Brookdale canceled 49 existing purchase options worth $153 million and will make cash payments to HCP totaling $54 million for a total amount equal to $207 million. Because the transaction contained multiple moving pieces, we have provided additional disclosure on Page 32 in our supplemental package this quarter. We hope it will be a useful reference to help you update your financial models. Now let me take a minute to walk you through the details on a few significant items impacting our 2014 forecast that result from the 49-property portfolio being converted to a RIDEA structure. The imputed value of $129 million in favor of HCP to terminate the above market leases less the $23 million cost to cancel 19 purchase options will be recorded as $106 million of income to HCP upon closing. The benefit of $106 million is partially offset by a noncash charge of $70 million relating to the existing straight-line rent and other intangible assets. Accordingly, this transaction results in a onetime net gain of $36 million or $0.08 per share anticipated in the third quarter. This favorable item will be reflected as part of our GAAP net income and NAREIT FFO, but excluded from our FFOs adjusted and FAD metrics to provide a comparable run rate. Finally, our increased 2014 earnings guidance. Our current year -- our current full year guidance now assumes that the Brookdale transaction closing at the end of August and does not include the impact of any future acquisitions. Our existing portfolio continues to perform in line with forecasts with projected full year cash same property performance growth unchanged at 3% to 4%. We are increasing our 2014 NAREIT FFO forecast by $0.05 per share to range between $3.01 and $3.07 per share. The increase is driven by a $0.01 accretive benefit from acquisitions closed during Q2, plus the $0.04 net benefit from transaction-related items that consist of the $0.08 net gain anticipated in Q3 from the closing of Brookdale's transaction described earlier partially offset by $0.04 of transaction costs in connection with the Brookdale and U.K. portfolio transactions. Excluding the net positive $0.04 per share impact from transaction-related items, we are raising our 2014 FFOs adjusted guidance $0.01 per share to a range of $2.97 and $3.03 per share, driven by the accretive acquisitions in Q2 mentioned earlier. We are raising our 2014 FAD guidance by $0.03 per share to range between $2.50 and $2.56 per share, driven by $0.01 per share recurring benefit from our second quarter investment activities mentioned in FFO, plus $0.02 per share from the pending transaction with Brookdale, including the new entrance fee CCRC joint venture platform, which, as a reminder, is expected to generate 8% projected cash yield during the first year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul?
Paul F. Gallagher: Thank you, Tim. Now let me review the portfolio's second quarter performance. Senior housing. Occupancy for our senior housing platform was 86.8%, unchanged from the prior quarter and 50 basis points higher than the prior year, driven by our RIDEA portfolio where occupancy has increased 120 basis points, and year-to-date, same property growth is 4.2%. Same property cash flow coverage for the portfolio was 1.10x, a decline of 1-basis-point from the prior quarter. Same property performance increased 2.8%, driven by contractual rent steps, partially offset by a decline in the performance of our Sunrise portfolio and timing of certain prior year expenses in the RIDEA portfolio. Same property growth is expected to ramp back up to 4% levels in the second half of the year. On June 6, 2014, we acquired 20 care home facilities from Maria Mallaband for GBP 75.8 million or $127 million at an attractive lease yield of 7.6%. The majority private pay facilities are located throughout the United Kingdom and represent our first direct equity investment in the U.K. The leases will have an initial term of 15 years and provide for initial annual rent of GBP 5.8 million or $9.7 million. The contractual rents will increase annually by the retail price index subject to a floor of 2% and a cap of 4.5%. The facilities are leased to Maria Mallaband Care Group, a premier provider with operations across the U.K., Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands. In June 2014, we expanded our relationship with Oakmont Senior Living by acquiring 2 assisted living and memory care facilities in California in a sale-leaseback transaction for $88 million, providing a first year lease yield of 6%. The facilities are triple-net leased for 15 years and are cross-defaulted with an existing master lease. Post-acute/skilled nursing. HCR's normalized fixed charge coverage for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2014, is 1.12x, down 2 basis points from March 31, 2014's coverage of 1.14x discussed on the last call. Normalized coverages exclude the impact of $24 million in insurance reserves accrued in June, and $6 million recorded last December related to prior period liability claims. Including these reserves, the as-reported June 30, 2014, coverage is 1.06x. HCR increased total census across all business lines in the second quarter relative to prior year levels and management continued to exhibit strong controls of operating expenses. Additionally, their hospice and home care businesses continued to deliver double-digit year-over-year growth, driven by significant census gains. However, the positive impact of these achievements was offset by industry-wide challenges including fewer hospital admissions, shorter average patient length of stay and the increasing preference for Medicare Advantage plans. We expect HCR's coverage to improve in the latter half of 2014 due to the disposition of 2 underperforming properties in the West Virginia market, the continued focus on cost savings opportunities and the confirmed 2% increase in Medicare reimbursement rates that takes effect October 1, and represents the second consecutive rate increase not offset by sequestration or other therapy provider cuts. HCR continues to invest approximately $100 million per year to maintain, upgrade and expand the facilities in HCP's portfolio, and ended the quarter with $151 million of cash on hand, up from $142 million at year end. Same property performance for our post-acute/skilled nursing portfolio was 3.4% for the quarter, driven by contractual rent steps on the HCR portfolio. Hospitals. Same property performance decreased 5.3% due to the modification and extension of our 3 acute care hospital leases with Tenet Healthcare that, as Tim mentioned, changed the timing of rent recognition over the first half of the year. However, it will have no impact on the full year same property performance, which is expected to grow by 2.5% over 2013. Cash flow coverage declined 1-basis-point from the prior quarter to 5.43x. Medical Office Buildings. Same property performance increased 2.2%, driven by rent steps. Occupancy for our total medical office portfolio declined 30 basis points from the prior quarter to 90.7% and includes 2 properties acquired in May that are 82% occupied. During the quarter, tenants representing 580,000 square feet took occupancy. The average term for new and renewal leases was 52 months and retention rate of 76%. We have 1.1 million square feet of scheduled expirations for the balance of 2014, excluding 532,000 square feet of month-to-month leases. We have executed a total of 500,000 square feet of leases that have yet to commence and have an active leasing pipeline of 1.2 million square feet. In May 2014, we acquired 2 Medical Office Buildings totaling 148,000 square feet for $26 million, yielding 7.7%. The properties are located in the historic Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami on the campus of HCA's Mercy Hospital. During the quarter, we commenced work on capital improvements in excess of $2 million designed to improve occupancy, which is currently at 82%. In June, we executed development agreements and commenced construction on a $19 million Medical Office Building with a projected return on cost of 8.7%. The MOB will be on the campus of a new hospital being developed by Memorial Hermann, the premier hospital operator in the Houston area and will complement an existing MOB on the same campus, which is 100% occupied. We have pre-leased 36% of the 98,000 square-foot building with strong interest in the remaining square footage. Life science. Same property performance grew 2.5% in the quarter, driven by rent steps. Occupancy for our life science portfolio increased 60 basis points from the prior quarter to 92.3%, driven by new leases in the Bay Area. For the quarter, tenants representing 111,000 square feet took occupancy with an average lease terms of 50 months. Leasing remains strong. During the quarter, we executed 3 leases for a total of 129,000 square feet in our Redwood City life science campus. The leases include 2 5-year leases for a total of 49,000 square feet and an 80,000 square-foot 10-year expansion, an extension of an existing life science tenant. This quarter's leasing, combined with leases signed in the first quarter, addresses 93% of the 160,000 square-foot exploration mentioned on our last call and results in a 70% increase in rents by converting office space to lab space. In April 2014, we executed a 26,000 square-foot 7-year lease for a total of 85,000 square feet when combined with leases executed in March, which fully leases our 915,000 square-foot South San Francisco Oyster Point life science campus. Scheduled expirations for the balance of 2014 are 196,000 square feet, of which 30% has already been leased to new tenants. Additionally, we've executed 300,000 square feet of new leases expected to commence within the next 8 months, which should bring our occupants -- our year-end occupancy to over 94%, representing the highest occupancy since we acquired the portfolio in 2007. During the quarter, we acquired a 92,000 square-foot life science building for $44 million with a going-in yield of 6.3%. The building is 90% leased and represents an expansion of our existing Torrey Pines Science Park campus and is adjacent to 500,000 square feet of HCP life science buildings. Life science development pipeline consists of 2 projects totaling 230,000 square feet that are 100% pre-leased and one 78,000 square foot project that is 63% leased. Sustainability. In June, we received the second highest ranking in the U.S. real estate industry for environmental performance by the 2014 Newsweek Green Rankings. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Lauralee.
Lauralee E. Martin: Thank you, Paul. Just a few brief comments on HCR ManorCare before I open the call for questions. We were disappointed that industry-wide litigation in skilled care continues to impact professional liability reserves of even the best operators like HCR. We remain confident in HCR's management team and continue to believe that the majority of market headwinds are behind them. They continue to take market share as a result of their quality health care outcomes. They are achieving double-digit growth in hospice and home health. Although this ancillary business income principally emanates from their facility operations, the income is reported at the corporate level, not at the facility level. Our master lease is supported by HCR's corporate guarantee, and as such, we report both corporate fixed charge coverage and facility lease coverage. HCR also continues to maintain a strong liquidity position, ending the quarter with $151 million of cash and $95 million available under its bank lines. With the 2% Medicare reimbursement rate increase confirmed by CMS last week and the full benefit from the cost reductions coming in the second half, we expect improving financial performance. I'm pleased to welcome Jim Hoffmann to our Board of Directors. Jim is a former partner and Senior Vice President of Wellington Management Company, where he served as the firm's Senior Global REIT Analyst and Portfolio Manager. I am looking forward to Jim's advice and counsel on our board, given his 30-plus years in real estate investment, both domestic and international. In conclusion, we had a solid second quarter, and I thank the HCP professionals for their contributions to our success. Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.
Nicholas Yulico: Several questions. First, on the U.K, can you talk a little bit about how you sourced that investment, whether it was -- actually a broker was used or you just used your relationships? And then also, it looks like there might be about 40 properties or so left with the operator and whether or not the operator owns that real estate or who owns that real estate?
Paul F. Gallagher: Yes, as Lauralee mentioned, we've been in the U.K. market since July of 2012 and on 2 fairly high-profile transactions and we've created kind of a good reputation over there. We've talked to a lot of folks. We've got a very strong pipeline out there. We sourced that deal just by being over in the marketplace. There was representation on the other side. So the other assets that they own are not typically care homes. They've got more specialized uses at this point in time and a lot of those are leased already.
Nicholas Yulico: And what's the coverage on that portfolio?
Paul F. Gallagher: It's about a 1.5x coverage.
Nicholas Yulico: That's an EBITDAR coverage?
Paul F. Gallagher: That's an EBITDARM coverage. 1.6x EBITDARM coverage.
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And then just going back to ManorCare. In the trailing 12 months EBITDAR that was reported in the supplemental this quarter went down from the one that was in the last supplemental by about $11 million. Could you explain what was going on there? And then also just I want to be clear about -- I think you mentioned something about insurance reserves in June and whether or not that would be in the facility EBITDAR going forward or only in the fixed charge coverage metrics?
Paul F. Gallagher: The GL/PL charge is at the facility level. Just to give you a little color on HCR. As I mentioned and as Lauralee mentioned, they've experienced some very strong reimbursement headwinds and sequestration. In October this year, they will benefit from the first time 2 years of year-over-year rate increases. Additionally, in October this year, they'll have the full benefit of the cost reductions that they implemented in the fourth quarter last year. And in April 2015, the impact of sequestration will be eliminated. We expect to see coverages improve fourth quarter 2014 results, and further improvement in the second and third quarters of 2015.
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And then sorry, what was the reason for the drop in the EBITDAR this quarter versus last quarter, the annualized level?
Lauralee E. Martin: We continue to have a shift into the managed Medicare which is impacting some of the cost features, reimbursement features. But offsetting that, they continue to take market share. But at the moment, that's a bigger impact.
Paul F. Gallagher: And that's been an ongoing theme for quite a few quarters.
Nicholas Yulico: Okay, got it. And then just lastly, Lauralee, how are you viewing the investment market today? I mean, if you look, you did several of U.S. deals at a 6.63%, I think you said was the blended cap rate in the U.S. and we've now seen some big portfolios, like Griffin today and ATT [ph] trade at cap rates that were somewhere in the 6% to 6.5% range. Do you think that people have gotten more aggressive on pricing of individual assets? Or is it just that there's some value being ascribed to bigger portfolios today?
Lauralee E. Martin: I think we've seen a dynamic that the bigger portfolios get aggressively bid mainly because someone else has done the aggregation work and there is a real hunger for yield in assets. So there's no question that sellers are seeing a good market to sell and are taking advantage of that. I guess comment to make on ours, we've seen our pipelines increase with the $1.1 billion that we either have closed or closing. We're converting that nicely. We expect to do that throughout the balance of the year. I think some of the characteristics of the medium-sized transactions that you've seen us do have some value-add characteristics to them, such as what we're doing with MOBs or the life science, also where they're strategic to other assets that we have or are very important to operator relationships, particularly to hospitals. And that allows us to be able to negotiate something that is good for both parties and therefore, we've been able to still achieve nice spreads on assets.
Paul F. Gallagher: Yes, I would add that while we have done a couple of transactions in that low-6% range, one was with an existing relationship. But we've also done transactions that have yielded higher returns. We've got a 7.7% cap rate on our MOB asset that we purchased. We've got a 7.6% cap rate on our U.K. portfolio, and we have an 8% cap rate on our CCRC joint venture that we've done with Brookdale. So we've been able to kind of take advantage of some of the relationships we have in the marketplace.
Nicholas Yulico: Just one last question over in the U.K. HC-One has been in the press the last several months as being up for sale and at one point, you guys were mentioning as being possibly involved, I think, on the debt side. Is there any update you can give there as to whether that could still be a possible debt investment?
Lauralee E. Martin: We don't comment on market rumors.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin: Wanted to follow-up on the ManorCare question. Just specifically around their SNF census, and I'm just curious if they're starting to show any growth there. I guess we're looking at bed count down 4% and the occupancy was down 150 basis points. So I'm just curious what's going on with their SNF census specifically?
Paul F. Gallagher: We're starting to see just a little bit of growth on just the pure SNF side.
Timothy M. Schoen: Second quarter '14 exceeded prior year. I mean, obviously, Josh, I know you follow the hospitals well. There's been lower admissions and that's really affected the ManorCare [ph] given the fact that 90% of their admissions come through the hospital. So they have -- in the second half of last year and the early part of this year, had that effect in the first half. But as you've seen recently, the admissions have been up in the hospital, so HCR should benefit that -- benefit from that in the second half of this year.
Joshua R. Raskin: And you think there might just be a timing lag between seeing a little bit better admission trends and then maybe discharges come a little bit after that, is that sort of the idea?
Timothy M. Schoen: Yes, it typically lags and then obviously with the final CMS ruling that came out, as Lauralee mentioned in her comments, that came out on Friday, that's created some -- the first sort of tailwinds in quite some time for that business.
Joshua R. Raskin: Got you. I think, Jack has got a quick follow-up, too.
Jack Meehan: Just maybe back to Paul on the cost savings initiatives that each [indiscernible] is putting into effect. So if adjust out the $24 million you talked about in June and just using some of the data from the Q, I was a little surprised that it looked like the operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased year-over-year, so I was just wondering are those initiatives done or are they showing up somewhere else?
Paul F. Gallagher: No, they still have 2 more quarters to have that kind of flow through so that you kind of get a true run rate on those.
Jack Meehan: Got it. Were they all completed in the fourth quarter though just because the first half over first half?
Paul F. Gallagher: They were initiated in the first quarter, and it took them a couple of quarters to implement them completely.
Timothy M. Schoen: And the reason for the initiation, Josh, is obviously the lower hospital volume. So Paul and his team were adjusting to the reduced admissions, so that was -- happened in the latter half of 2013, beginning of 2014.
Operator: Our next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: It sounds like competition in the U.K. is ramping up and it sounds like that sort of the topic of choice this quarter. Can you talk about competition there and sort of what sets you aside or what made you maybe win the deal that we just spoke about versus others?
Lauralee E. Martin: First of all, we've not had a dedicated team very focused on that. That came out of really our track record with our debt. So they come with a lot of credibility and very deep relationships there. So working that is the way that you stay ahead of it. I think, again, the marketplace understands that we're a viable source. We've proven it, understand their business and we think that there's opportunities. I wouldn't say that the U.K. is any more competitive than any other market.
Emmanuel Korchman: Are you surprised to see sort of the large caps all speaking about it at once, or you think that just happens to sound that way at the moment?
Lauralee E. Martin: No, I would expect that all transactions we all get to see. And as a result, we talk about them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Paul, I think you gave an EBITDARM coverage for the U.K. portfolio. Is that forward or is that a trailing number?
Paul F. Gallagher: That's a forward number.
Todd Stender: Do you have an EBITDAR coverage on a trailing basis?
Paul F. Gallagher: Yes, 1.3x.
Todd Stender: Okay. And is that under -- is that U.K. portfolio held under one master lease?
Paul F. Gallagher: It's a series of master lease all crossed up.
Todd Stender: Okay. And we've heard in the past, Tim, I know you've given some color on HCR ManorCare's CapEx dollars that they've put into the portfolio. Do you have any updated numbers for this year and maybe what their obligation is just as a reminder?
Timothy M. Schoen: They continue to invest between $100 million and $110 million in that portfolio, call it 60% to 65% of it is maintenance CapEx and about 1/3 is growth CapEx, Todd. So -- and in terms of your coverage on the Maria Mallaband portfolio, I had given you actually the EBITDAR coverage rate, which is 1.3x, not a trailing EBITDARM, so just we're clear.
Todd Stender: Okay. And then just lastly, just looking at the Medical Office Building portfolio, looks like rents renewed just shy of 4% lower. Can you break that out just to really show what the on-campus space release versus off-campus just seeing if that tells us anything?
Timothy M. Schoen: Yes, most of our portfolio, 93% of our portfolio is on-campus or affiliated, so that's not a useful break down. I think the way to think about that is those are legacy leases that are rolling off the height of the market. I think you should think about our MOB portfolio over the long run to be at market or between 1% to 2% positive mark-to-market over time. So I think it's just a timing issue, Todd.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.
Michael Knott: Lauralee, just curious if you would expand a little bit more about your appetite for additional international expansion. I think you mentioned you don't have a team on the ground over there. Just curious, I think, about next steps or what sort of the follow-on might be.
Lauralee E. Martin: Well, it's a market that we're very close to. Yes, you're correct. That's not on the ground, but it's a dedicated team here that makes a lot of trips and keeps the relationships very open. So as we have a platform, it justifies thinking about costs to actually put them on the ground. And before that, we were debt. So it didn't make sense. Now that we're in an ownership position and expanding our activity, we'll be evaluating that.
Michael Knott: Is the U.K. the only place on the other side of the Atlantic that you're looking or is it a broader scope than that?
Lauralee E. Martin: We've looked across Europe, particularly in the developed markets. They all have somewhat similar dynamics in terms of their health care reimbursement dynamics and a growing interest in the private pay dynamics. So yes, we're looking at those.
Michael Knott: And then I know you've talked about wanting to expand your operator relationships to drive external growth and obviously there's the Brookdale transaction you can point to. Is there anything that we could expect with ManorCare in terms of any opportunities there to deploy capital?
Lauralee E. Martin: We have previously stated and I would keep the same remarks that we're supportive of ManorCare and if growth assists them to be more financially successful, we are a strong backer of them to do that. But we need to find opportunities that make sense for both of us economically for that to happen.
Michael Knott: Okay. And then last one for me. I know you're all very mindful of CapEx, particularly in senior housing as it relates to triple-net versus RIDEA. Just curious of your view of sort of the CapEx adjusted same-store NOI growth between those 2 segments, how that's shaping up, either this year so far or maybe even looking forward, the next year or 2?
Timothy M. Schoen: Well, I think, listen, we've -- I'll take our RIDEA portfolio as an example, Michael. We've grown about 7.5% last year, and we're forecasted to grow by 5% in that portfolio. On that CapEx adjusted basis, that will most probably grow between 4% and 5%. Now keep in mind, those were non-stabilized portfolios, so those are the reasons -- that's the reason they're in a RIDEA portfolio. But it's above average growth for our portfolio as compared to the 3% to 3.5% we get in our triple-net leases.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.
Juan C. Sanabria: Just hoping you could speak a little bit more about potentially helping ManorCare grow if it improves their business. What kind of opportunities would that be? Would it be redeveloping existing properties or helping them finance acquisitions of new assets?
Paul F. Gallagher: I think when we look across ManorCare, we kind of look at all the various different options, whether that would be financing new developments or new acquisitions, whether it would be providing expansion of existing facilities on available land, addition by subtraction like they did selling 2 particular assets. So I think we're kind of open to all avenues to help them grow.
Juan C. Sanabria: And is there, from a portfolio perspective, a max that you'd feel kind of comfortable getting to in terms of total exposure to ManorCare that where you can grow from here? How do you -- if you could just help us think about that.
Paul F. Gallagher: We're going to look at it on a risk-adjusted basis and see what it does to the health of the company, and to the extent it solves a long-term problem, I think that we would be willing to take our exposure up.
Juan C. Sanabria: Okay. And you've made earlier comments at the beginning of the call about an additional $600 million of committed capital for deals, I guess, in the second half. Hoping you could speak a little bit about pricing expectations there sort of ballpark cap rates and geographic location and just the asset type that, that $600 million encompasses.
Timothy M. Schoen: Yes, that $600 million, Juan, represents the previously announced Brookdale CCRC joint venture, where we own 49% of the $1.2 billion portfolio. So -- and that's -- and pricing expectations, as I've mentioned in my script, is an 8% cap rate. So -- and then just so you know, just so we're clear, there's no other acquisitions in our guidance. But that $600 million is the Brookdale CCRC joint venture.
Juan C. Sanabria: Okay, great. And wondering if you could comment at all on your views on changes potentially in the observation days in hospitals sort of regulations and audits there that may or may not help the SNFs over time and kind of what your guys are thinking and potential impacts for coverage levels, et cetera.
Paul F. Gallagher: I think that remains to be seen.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Carroll: Can you guys give us a little bit more color about the U.K. portfolio? I know in the press release it indicated that the assets are throughout the U.K. Is there any concentration? How old are the assets? And are these mostly private pay?
Paul F. Gallagher: Mostly private pay, a little over 60% private pay, which is something that we like. They are located middle part of the country, some around London and I believe we have one in Ireland. These are typically newer facilities, purpose-built and very nice and attractive assets.
Timothy M. Schoen: About 60% is residential, about 40% is nursing care.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then did MMCG -- did they build most of these assets? I mean, how big of a development platform do they have and do you expect that, that could be a, I guess, meaningful investment opportunity for you?
Paul F. Gallagher: They've build 4 of these, but they have a pretty active pipeline where they've got several facilities right now that they're either developing or have identified land to be able to develop.
Michael Carroll: Okay. And then what other opportunities do you see in the U.K.? Do you expect that you'll focus on the care homes? Or is there other property types that interest you in that market?
Paul F. Gallagher: We've look primarily in the hospital and the care home sector. And because of what's happening with the banking system over there and lack of liquidity, a lot of these operators are in need of capital. So they're -- we see a lot of opportunity. There's going to be the potential for some consolidation down the road and development of new product.
Michael Carroll: Do you think most of your, I guess, investments in care homes, will they be acquisitions or would they be more developments?
Timothy M. Schoen: I don't know. All done on a risk-adjusted basis.
Michael Carroll: Do you see more opportunities in any, I guess, segment or is it just you're still looking at everything?
Paul F. Gallagher: I think there's a good opportunity to acquire and consolidate amongst various different operators. It's actually much more fragmented than in the United States.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.
Richard C. Anderson: So when I think about the U.K., it's suddenly everybody's topic du jour. I'm just curious what has happened there to suddenly have all of you, in the last couple of years, become very interested in that area? And what do you think the next market is out there after the U.K. that kind of pencils out pretty well at this point?
Paul F. Gallagher: Well, I think in the U.K., you saw a dynamic in the early 2000s where a lot of portfolios were debt-financed at very high levels and you saw property prices get reset. And a lot of that debt is either coming due or has come due and the operators have had a lack of liquidity because the banks have not been available to provide capital, and it's created an opportunity. And we look at markets where this dislocation and to the extent you have other markets that have similar type dynamics, we take a look at that as well.
Richard C. Anderson: And is that Germany next or France or where is that next market do you think? Where do you think you can be a leader?
Paul F. Gallagher: We're looking across the landscape.
Richard C. Anderson: Okay. Question on HCR bigger picture. One of the beautiful things about the Brookdale-Emeritus deal for you guys is we're not talking about Emeritus' coverage anymore. So I'm curious if you've given any thought to applying some of the logic that you applied to the Emeritus, now Brookdale, transaction in kind of addressing low -- thin coverages and applying that here at HCR ManorCare so that we don't spend so much time talking about coverage in future conference calls.
Lauralee E. Martin: I think the Brookdale transaction really was a tremendous opportunity for us to be part of the Brookdale-Emeritus merger and really do 2 things, which we accomplished. It was to address what you pointed out, but also to have a growth platform going forward. HCR has not indicated any issues with our rent. We've stayed supportive of them. And as we've mentioned several times, they've had a lot of headwinds, but it seems like maybe they are slowing down and with a little bit of tailwinds with now a better reimbursement market, they can improve their financial performance.
Richard C. Anderson: Okay. And then last question -- and I think it has to be said, Jay Flaherty, part of a much bigger audience -- organization now with the news today. I'm curious is this management team at HCP kind of in place or what is the risk that he could start hiring people away? What would you say the commitment is to the people at HCP so that the team stays intact if there are some outside forces when that becomes available to happen?
Lauralee E. Martin: Well, all employees are employees of will (sic) [at-will], but HCP is a tremendous place to work coming into it. The pride of the people in that business and the portfolio is extraordinary. Their ability to enhance their careers and continue the success of the past is nothing but up. And we take our market risk with people as everybody else does, but we think we're in a good spot.
Paul F. Gallagher: We have a core management team below the CEO that has been together for a very long time. We have good, well-executing P&L leaders that know their business extremely well. We can source deals, we can asset manage deals and we have delivered consistent results over the years despite the fact that we have a transition in CEO.
Richard C. Anderson: Well, you chiming in helps that a lot. I appreciate that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: HCR ManorCare, again, I know we've talked about this a lot. Again, this idea of coverage improving going forward, I feel we've been talking about it for several quarters now. And then 2Q, you have the annualized rent bump that I believe happened in April. Just curious, again, even after the rent bump, you still feel confident that coverages will improve over the next 2 to 3 quarters.
Paul F. Gallagher: Yes.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: What did coverage look like in 2Q itself after the rent bump versus the 1Q numbers you reported in the supplemental?
Timothy M. Schoen: Well, that was a normalized 1.12x number that Paul gave.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Normalized -- Okay, 12 months. Okay, Okay. That's helpful.
Lauralee E. Martin: The rent bump's about 1-basis-point a quarter, so if that helps.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: The rent bump is about 1-basis-point a quarter, okay. And then for the SNF portfolio, the coverage declined from 1.7x to 1.61x. Again, is that primarily on ManorCare or was that something across all your SNF operators that kind of drove that down?
Paul F. Gallagher: No, there was some add [ph] rents with respect to some expansions in our covenant care portfolio that had some impact in the rest of the portfolio. It was nothing major.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: So it's still predominantly all ManorCare that kind of caused that pull down in 2Q?
Paul F. Gallagher: No, it was not ManorCare.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: So if it was not ManorCare, so it was many of your other [ph] operators?
Paul F. Gallagher: Yes.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. And then last one, Lauralee, I mean the addition of Jim Hoffmann, I'm glad you acknowledged that on the call. Again, when you just take a look at Jim's background and kind of what you're trying to achieve going forward, where exactly do you expect him to contribute most towards the company as he kind of gets up to speed as a board member at HCP?
Lauralee E. Martin: He has a tremendous reputation and background in investments. We take an awful lot of our board -- a lot of deals to our board because of their size. And to have someone interpret those investments with more of a REIT-look potentially than just a general real estate investment approach just brings us more balance and more robustness. So we just think it's a good stimulus as we get into the dialogue of keeping investment disciplines and where that greatest investment return opportunities are.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Mains with Stifel.
Robert M. Mains: Just got a couple of odds and ends. Tim, the $36 million gain that you described on the Brookdale conversion, will that be hanging out next quarter in other income?
Timothy M. Schoen: That will actually end up in the -- it will be in revenues, actually. It's a termination of a lease.
Robert M. Mains: Okay. And then what kind of run rate should we expect for straight-line rents on the other side of that?
Timothy M. Schoen: The other side of that for the second half of this year, it's about $8 million a quarter.
Robert M. Mains: Okay. The transaction costs in this quarter, they're hanging out in G&A?
Timothy M. Schoen: Yes.
Robert M. Mains: Okay. And did I hear it correctly, the coverage numbers that you gave, the consolidated HCR ManorCare coverages, those do not include prior period reserve adjustments?
Timothy M. Schoen: That's right.
Robert M. Mains: Okay. I think that's a good move to have those out. And then my final question. Tim, did I hear you say that the care home's 60%, residential, 40%, nursing?
Timothy M. Schoen: Yes.
Robert M. Mains: And the nursing is NHS?
Paul F. Gallagher: All local. A small piece NHS, a lot of that is local authority. But Remember, Robert, 62% is private pay.
Operator: We have a follow-up from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: Yes, just on ManorCare, what is the lease bump next year? Is it 3.5% or is that down to 3%? I can't remember whether we're off the high...
Paul F. Gallagher: I believe it's the last year of 3.5%.
Emmanuel Korchman: So you still have another sizable bump.
Paul F. Gallagher: This should be, I think, the last 3.5% bump we have.
Emmanuel Korchman: In '15, will be the last 3.5%.
Paul F. Gallagher: I'm sorry. We have 2 more 3.5% bumps.
Emmanuel Korchman: Right. And I guess, if you think about that sort of above average bump for the next 2 years and you think about the Emeritus Brookdale, that wasn't something that got all negotiated when the deal got announced you'd been working with Emeritus for a long period of time -- even prior to the Brookdale merger to try to come to some restructuring of the leases. I guess why shouldn't we think that the same...
Paul F. Gallagher: We were not in any type of restructuring discussions with Emeritus prior to that merger. No, that was not the case.
Emmanuel Korchman: So you had never any conversations whatsoever about potentially...
Paul F. Gallagher: No, we had not discussed any type of restructuring with Emeritus.
Timothy M. Schoen: No, remember those are triple-net leases with a corporate guarantee, so there was no restructuring discussions.
Emmanuel Korchman: I guess you said that -- you're saying that HCR ManorCare has no issues with the current or the forecasted bumps in their lease at all?
Paul F. Gallagher: They have made no indication about their inability to pay rent.
Timothy M. Schoen: Listen. I think Lauralee said it. They've had a very difficult operating environment the last 2 years. Coming out in April this year in 2014 is the first year that they're out from underneath sequestration. They've got 2% reimbursement increases that are now announced in October. And if you look at the underlying fundamentals of that business, obviously Medicare Advantage has been difficult for them, but hospital census has been down. So we've recently seen some hospital census come up. And we've also, if you deconstruct that portfolio, 75% of it is post-acute, about 10% of that is assisted living, both of those are going to grow at 3% to 5%. And then you look at their home health care and hospice business, which is growing double digits, which is about 15% of that business. So there is, for the first time, in quite some time they've got some tailwinds.
Paul F. Gallagher: And remember, trailing 12 months reporting here so all this is kind of old news. You won't see the full year benefit of that sequestration going way until April 2015. So it's going to take some time in order for that to roll through on a complete trailing 12-month basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller: Tim, I was just wondering the $32 million lease termination fee tied to the Brookdale transactions, how and when does that start hitting the income statement?
Timothy M. Schoen: That will hit in the third quarter. It's [indiscernible].
Michael W. Mueller: So that is the third -- the $36 million is...
Timothy M. Schoen: Yes, that will be at closing, Michael, we're anticipating that to be at the end of August and the $36 million will hit when we got perspective in the third quarter.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back to Lauralee Martin, President and CEO, for closing remarks.
Lauralee E. Martin: Thank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Again, just in conclusion, we had a very solid second quarter, and we're on track to deliver quality accretive investment growth this year. And we look forward to meeting with you on our next conference call. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."
