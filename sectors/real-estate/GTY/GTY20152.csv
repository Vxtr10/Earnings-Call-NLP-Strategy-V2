With that, let me turn the call over to David Driscoll, our Chief Executive Officer.
David Driscoll: Thank you, Josh, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our call for the second quarter of 2015. This was an extremely busy and productive quarter for Getty. And underlying it all was another quarter that showed consistent improvement in our operating results demonstrated by growth in FFO and AFFO per share. There were four big headlines this quarter. First, our previously announced $214 million acquisition of 77 convenience and gas stations leased to United Oil. Second, the refinance of our credit facility that was lengthened maturities and lock in attractive long-term interest rates. Third, collection of an additional approximately $7 million, which works up to $0.22 per share from a liquidating GPMI estate and our announcement this afternoon, that our board approved 9% increase in our annual dividend rate to $0.96 per share. Let me touch on a few highlights from our quarter, which represented another period of strong growth marked by stable operating results. Our portfolio of 875 properties along with improved cost controls resulted in another quarter of strong AFFO at $0.33 per share, which represented year-over-year growth of 10%. Importantly, we exclude the one-time benefits of the $0.22 per share we received from the liquidating trust, and I spoke about earlier, when we talk about recurring AFFO and growth from last year's quarter. Even more exciting is the fact that we achieved these results having received only a partial contribution from our acquisition of the 77 properties in the United portfolio that closed in May. To that point, we are well positioned to continue producing improvement in our cash flow and earnings as we move ahead in the third quarter and beyond. Turning to expenses, rental property expenses were consistent with the prior quarter. While G&A [ph] increased by approximately $1 million in the quarter. Substantially, all this increase was related to acquisition cost and other one-time costs pending from our systems upgrades. Our environment expense of $1.8 million was also inline with our prior quarter, but I want to be clear that this expense does not reflect our actual spend, which was a different amount this quarter. Turning to our most recent acquisition the 77 store United acquisition accomplished a number of things for us including expanding our geographic reach into the fastest growing regions of the country. Adding an additional institutional quality major tenant, while generating significant accretion on a per share basis. That said, the market for convenience and gas stations is not divorced [ph] from global capital markets, which are being impacted by increased rate expectations, increased volatility illustrated by the Greek and Chinese and commodity markets meltdowns and what appears to be an abundance capital chasing acquisitions and yield. We believe, this demand is distorting prices by holding cap rates below reasonable levels. As a result, while we continue to review opportunities and remain highly diligent and even more disciplined with respect to opportunities that we're willing to pursue. Beyond external growth, we continue to have very attractive opportunities for growth from our own portfolio, that can be achieved through additional repositioning, redeveloping, repurposing and otherwise optimizing the yield on that existing portfolio. We are definitely focused on unlocking, the embedded growth from these opportunities and expect them to generate a steady tailwind of growth, as we begin to execute on our plans and bring them online in the future. At this point, our leverage levels are inline our peers. We had no ongoing principal repayment obligations and our nearest maturities is five years away. Furthermore, approximately 50% of our borrowings are fixed rate, as we're not subject to risk from increases in short-term rates. In summary, we remain energised by both the organic and growth opportunities, we continue to pursue. We are well capitalized and have flexibility on a great management team and will continue to work to enhance value for our shareholders in 2015 and beyond. That concludes my prepared remarks, so let me ask the operator to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] we'll take a question from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan
Anthony Paolone: Thanks. Good afternoon
David Driscoll: Hello.
Anthony Paolone: Dave, can you talk about just exactly where returns are on the product that you're seeing as you articulated the desire to be disciplined, but you did get a big transaction done. And so just maybe bucket kind of returns, cap rates to economics on what you're working at are?
David Driscoll: It's a pretty wide spread Tony, ranging from single unit properties that take good pictures and have perceived credit with long-term leases behind them. You can see those trading at sub 5 cap rates, mostly in a 1031 market, but certainly sub 5. There is, I think significantly more demand starts to come in at the 6.5 plus or minus range. We're perceiving that more from private entities, but again what they're looking for is longer term lease terms and perceived credit quality. You can get into the mid 7s or certainly low 7s, if you're willing to deal with something that's only 4 years to 5 years left on a lease term and maybe a lesser known credit quality. But still, all of those numbers are pretty aggressive for what we think, those things should trade at a normalized capital markets kind of place.
Anthony Paolone: Where would you guys like to play in that spectrum, like would you want to take leasing risk or credit or where do you think your sweet spot is in terms of where you'd like to be?
David Driscoll: We're prepared to take short-term tenant or short-term lease risk because we think we can understand the operating parameters at the unit level. So where we see opportunity for those kinds of properties that's a place, we would be intrigued to go in. I think, the other thing is certainly with respect to credit, since we're primarily driven on a unit level operating or unit level underwriting basis. We also can step away, we don't need a Circle K or 7-11 credit. We're happy to find those, but frankly you're finding people who are paying up for, what are not institutional quality credits and that's one of my caution flags, that I think you hear me throwing into the wind here about where we see this market today.
Anthony Paolone: And in some of your assets, where you have your number of assets with one tenant or distributors exposure, do you have the ability to sell those one-off like you mentioned CapEx and some of the longer duration stuff being in the 5's. Like can you, can you [indiscernible]?
David Driscoll: Virtually, all of our leases permitted they're visible, if you will by property. So they permit us to sell individual units out of them.
Anthony Paolone: Okay, great. Thank you.
David Driscoll: You're welcome.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Driscoll for any additional or closing remarks.
David Driscoll: I don't have a lot of additional remarks. Other than to wish everyone, the best for the rest of the summer and we look forward to talking to you again in November with our next quarterly call. Thank you.
Operator: That will conclude today's conference. Thank you all once again for your participation."
