"Operator: Good morning. My name is Christian, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PotlatchDeltic Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. .  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Richards, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for opening remarks. Sir, you may proceed.
Jerald Richards : Thank you, Christian. Good morning, and welcome to PotlatchDeltic's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. While he's a familiar face to you, this is Eric Cremers first earnings call as President and Chief Executive Officer.
Eric Cremers : Thank you, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, this is my first earnings call as the company's Chief Executive Officer. I want to start by thanking Mike Covey, who retired after being our CEO for 14 years and is now continuing with the company as our Executive Chairperson. PotlatchDeltic is a very different company today due to his leadership. Over that time, we converted to a REIT. We spun off our pulp and paper assets. We improved the performance of our core businesses, and we completed a very successful merger with Deltic Timber.  Today, we have high-quality assets, a winning strategy that is well aligned with industry fundamentals, an investment-grade balance sheet and a strong commitment to increasing shareholder value over the long-term through disciplined and opportunistic capital allocation decisions. I worked very closely with Mike in the 14 years that I have been with the company. He was an excellent mentor and our philosophies are well aligned. I do not anticipate any significant changes to our strategy going forward. Now turning to our 2020 results. 2020 was a phenomenal year by virtually every measure. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $382 million in 2020, which is a record since we elected REIT status in 2006. Furthermore, all 3 of our business units posted record profitability in 2020. I want to thank our employees for their performance, flexibility, creativity and continued focus through the COVID pandemic. Our outstanding 2020 results are a tribute to a Group committed to operating at the highest level. Our Wood Products segment generated $176 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020, our employees' strong resolve and focus on operating safely allowed us to take advantage of robust demand and historic lumber prices. In fact, both our Bemidji, Minnesota and our Waldo, Arkansas sawmills had stellar safety performance going incident-free in 2020. On the operational front, we shipped just under 1.1 billion board feet of lumber and completed virtually all of our capital projects on time and under budget despite the challenges presented by the COVID pandemic.
Jerald Richards : Thank you, Eric. Starting with Page 4 of the slides, adjusted EBITDA increased from $135 million in the third quarter to $164 million in the fourth quarter, beating the company record that was just set last quarter. Higher indexed Idaho log prices and a bulk land sale in Minnesota more than offset seasonally lower harvest and lumber shipment volumes. I will now review each of our operating segments and provide more color on the fourth quarter results. Information for our Timberlands segment is displayed on slides 5 through 7. The segment's adjusted EBITDA was $62.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $59.7 million in the third quarter. We harvested 378,000 tons of sawlogs in the North in the fourth quarter. This is down seasonally from the 555,000 tons that we harvested in the third quarter.
Operator:  Your first question is from Ketan Mamtora from BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora : Congrats on a strong quarter. First question, maybe I want to start off with capital allocation priorities. Balance sheet is in a very good shape. Your net leverage is down to 1.3 times. Q1 is looking very strong. Can you talk about sort of what are your priorities? You touched upon M&A little bit. But just sort of discuss between sort of share repurchases and M&A, how you think about it?
Eric Cremers : Good morning, Ketan. Well, returning cash to shareholders in the form of a sustainable dividend, quite frankly, it's our top priority, and we analyze and review capital allocation options regularly. And what I would suggest to you is that our options, generally from most likely to least likely are as follows. So regarding a dividend, we just increased a 2.5% in December. And as you know, the Board typically does an in-depth review of our dividend in December of each year. So we just hike it. So we feel good about where the dividend is. The next capital allocation item that we give consideration to is Wood Products’ CapEx. As Jerry mentioned in his opening remarks, we're going to spend just under $30 million on discretionary mill projects in 2021. The average return that we expect to get for those projects is 32%. So we're constantly looking for projects to invest in our mills because they typically have very high returns. So that's the second highest priority for our capital allocation. I would say third is M&A. We're interested in acquiring timberland, mills or a combination of the two, generally in or near our current operating areas. The one caveat is that we're only going to pursue M&A if it creates shareholder value, quite frankly, like the Deltic merger did. So M&A is generally third on the list.  Fourth might be debt repayment. It's hard to get too excited about paying debt down today, given where we're at with historically low interest rates. And frankly, we've got an under leveraged balance sheet as we sit here today.  And then the last item in terms of list of priorities is share repurchases. Share repurchases are opportunistic. We want to buy low when we do repurchase shares, and it seems most of the market gets that wrong. But we have to reserve cash on the balance sheet and be very opportunistic when we see a dislocation in our share price. And right now, we're not buying back shares because we think our stock is approaching NAV. So does that answer your question?
Ketan Mamtora : It does. Just a couple of follow-ups on that. Within the discretionary CapEx you have in Wood Products, can you touch upon maybe a couple of key projects that you all are doing?
Eric Cremers : Yes. Sure. So for 2021, we've got really 7 key discretionary projects that we're pursuing, again, costing about $30 million. We're putting in a new stacker at our Ola sawmill down in Arkansas to improve production volumes, roughly 10 million feet. We've got a new auto grader going into our Bemidji mill, that's going to improve grade yield and lower costs. We've got a new optimized log in feed system going into our St. Maries mill, which is going to improve recovery. And we've got a new plywood scarf line going in out at our St. Maries plywood mill that's going to improve product mix and lower costs. So all of these projects collectively have got that 32% return on average, but they run from anywhere from, I think, 14% on the low end, all the way up to 41% on the high end. Just a great set of projects that we're really excited about.
Ketan Mamtora : Got it. That's helpful. And then I was a little surprised looking at your FY '21 lumber shipment volumes, 1.1 billion which is essentially kind of flat with what you had in 2020. Given what we are seeing with housing, is there a bit of conservatism in these numbers? Or maybe to talk about it differently, how much headroom do you have from a capacity standpoint to increase your production?
Eric Cremers : Well, we're going to -- we anticipate increasing shipments roughly 15 million to 20 million feet, 2021 versus 2020. We've got a little bit of conservatism built into our numbers, simply because COVID is still with us. And COVID is costing us anywhere from 5 million to 10 million feet a quarter. But I think one of the things you have to recall is that in Q4 of 2019, we did not ship well. We finished 2019 with relatively high inventories, and a lot of that inventory got shipped in Q1 of 2020. So bottom line is 2020 was relatively inflated because we shipped a lot in Q1 that was produced in the prior year. I think there's a little bit of conservatism built into our numbers. I think it's fair to say that whenever we've got margin, we're running our mills as hard as we can, running as many hours as we can. Certainly, that's the case today. But generally speaking, we've got an increase in shipments plan of 15 million to 20 million feet, and hopefully, we can beat that.
Ketan Mamtora : Got it. And just 1 last question before I turn it over. Coming back to dividend. You talked about you’ll increase at the end of December. Is there any sort of change in thought around kind of the approach to dividend, given how strong cash flows are looking on the lumber side of things? And I know you said, you don't want to push it too much given there's volatility in Wood Products’ EBITDA, but given how strong they are looking at right now, is there any change in approach in terms of whether there's some sort of a baseload to dividend? And then the remaining would be linked to EBITDA from lumber?
Jerald Richards : Yes. Appreciate the question, Ketan. And I would say there really has been no change in our philosophy around the dividend. As Eric mentioned, our focus is on growing it sustainably over the long-term, and we always pin that dividend to our more stable part of our cash flows. When you think about lumber price-driven and other volatile cash flows, that's what provides the discretionary capital that we can then go look for returns to drive shareholder value over the long-term. So again, dividend is based on stable cash flows, and there tends to be a bit of conservatism. I think, served us well through the -- early in 2020 when the COVID pandemic first hit, our dividend was not under pressure, a very comfortable level. And the flip side is we certainly have a fair bit of capital available to deploy. And as Eric mentioned, he kind of walked you through our priorities, and we couldn't be more excited about the opportunities to deploy that cash and put it to work to drive shareholder value for the long-term.
Operator: Your next question is from Paul Quinn from RBC Capital Markets.
Paul Quinn : Just maybe a couple of questions on your outlook. Just looking at the -- on the Timberlands side, just a flat pricing in the North. Why do we expect that to be flat?
Jerald Richards : Yes. The starting point for that flat pricing, Paul, is we had record sawlog prices in the fourth quarter. And then also the other element that plays into it is timing of price resets. And historically, it's been about a 6-week lag between a move in Western lumber prices and the move in our Idaho sawlog pricing. And certainly, you're going to see that timing effect play out in the first quarter as well. So when we're flat quarter-over-quarter at record prices, that's still really strong levels. The other thing I will take an opportunity to point out is, in the past, we've talked about having these indexed agreements on an evergreen basis for 3 years. At the end of the year, we actually negotiated with key customers and those are now 5-year arrangements. And so we've lengthened the time. And then number two, that 6-week lag that I just mentioned now is 4 weeks. So you're going to see more current, more kind of frequent update in the pricing that we realize. And the other key element that I should mention as well is our logs get seasonally denser in the first quarter to the tune of about 5%. So that's a little bit of a drag or a headwind on the quarter-over-quarter price realization comparison.
Paul Quinn : Okay. That's helpful there. And then maybe just on the Real Estate side, I see your guidance on sort of on the development side, 50 lots in Q1, 145 total. Just I would expect that lot -- that development lot pricing to be flat or increase over time, just seeing what we're seeing in the marketplace, but you're going from 95,000 in the first to 80,000 to 85,000. Is there a mix shift in those lots that do you expect to sell for the balance of the year?
Jerald Richards : You are correct, Paul. It is a mix shift. There's actually a wide range of price points that are reflected in our Chenal development. That range from lower end, kind of an entry-level portion of the project that sells at a much lower price point all the way up to premium golf course lots. So that's nothing more or less than just a shift in mix.
Paul Quinn : Okay. And then just overall, I mean, you had great results. Obviously, the market wasn't that impressed. Your shares came up 20% in last year, but they're down 5% this year. What do you guys have to do there to get your share price move into the right direction?
Eric Cremers : Well, Paul, all we can do is really focus our energy running around running the business as best as we possibly can. We think we've got a phenomenal track record. We've got a great record here of capital allocation -- smart capital allocation decisions. The stock market and stock price will take care of itself over time. So we're optimistic the market will recognize the value in the company over time.
Operator: Your next question is from John Babcock from Bank of America.
John Babcock : Starting out just on the lumber side, I was wondering if you might be able to provide your current and average realizations there?
Eric Cremers : Yes. So our current realization is about 40% higher than where we were in the fourth quarter on average, so plus 40%. And our quarter-to-date pricing is up about 33% compared to where we were in the fourth quarter.
John Babcock : Okay. So you are basically expecting some taper and that's how you get to the 20% to 25% guidance?
Eric Cremers : Yes. We expect a little bit of softness in March, very hard to predict. I mean we've got really strong order files pretty much out through the end of February, so we have really good insight on those prices. And it's hard to know, like Jerry mentioned, pricing volatility is unprecedented, but we're thinking markets could get a little soft in March.
John Babcock : And then next question is more with regards to the Timberlands side of things. Obviously, in the U.S. South prices have generally been, for sawlogs, pretty flat over time. And I was wondering if you're starting to see any signs of the markets firming there? And then also, if you can provide some sort of indicator, whether it's housing starts or any other indicator that might give us some indication of what it would take to get those markets to firm?
Jerald Richards : Yes. Unfortunately, John, we continue to see relatively flat sawlog prices in the U.S. South, and that continues to be our view going forward, at least for the foreseeable future, at least the next few years. We'll see movements from time to time as we saw in 2019 when wet weather constraints supply, and you'll see a little bit of a lift but it doesn't last. At times, when you see a new mill open up, you might see a little bit of a lift. But again, that really doesn't last at least in our wood baskets. And just the excess standing supply is so large that we think it will take a period of time for that situation to work itself out. And to give a couple of other pieces of information, and as a reminder, we're net short on sawlogs in the South. We actually consume more logs in our 3 Southern sawmills than we sell off our timberlands in the region. And the other data point is, recently, there was F2M put out a study that suggested that across the South broadly, not just in our wood baskets that there's enough fiber available to support another 50 to -- 40 to 50 sawmills above and beyond what's in place today. So just to give some anecdote that, again, we think it will take time.
John Babcock : Got you. And then just last question before I turn it over. I was just wondering, with lumber prices at historic levels right now, is this having any effect on your channel mix overall, also recognizing that the markets are incredibly tight right now and you're basically making shipments as you can and as the product actually is available?
Eric Cremers : No. I wouldn't -- I don't think it's impacting our channel mix at all. We've got a really good stable group of customers that have been with us for many, many years, and we continue to produce and sell to the same customer base. So I think the answer is no.
Operator: Your next question is from  from D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger : Just on the mill investment side. So you've outlined some high return opportunities, but I'd be interested to hear how you guys think about the potential for some larger greenfield type investments relative to acquisition opportunities. Obviously, there's still uncertainty related to COVID, but housing backdrop is very favorable as is the pricing environment yet. To-date, there haven't been a whole lot of new capacity announcements made. So just want to get your guys' thoughts around the risk associated with that and why it might not be higher on the priority list?
Eric Cremers : Yes. So we look at the economics of greenfield mill construction from time to time. And historically, spending our capital on discrete projects in our existing mills, it's either increase production, lower costs or improve grade yield, they tend to have much higher returns and are, therefore, more attractive investments. And on the current environment, it costs roughly $650 per 1,000 unit of capacity to build a new mill. It takes about 1.5 years to get it built. And then you've got operating challenges, getting the mill up and running. You've got staffing challenges. There's a very lengthy start-up curve. So I think it's fair to say our preference is simply to go the low risk, high-return route and make incremental improvements to the existing mills versus pursuing a greenfield mill expansion.
Kurt Yinger : Okay. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. All right. And then just lastly, could you just talk about how you're thinking about supply chain inventories right now? I know you talked about those being, I guess, historically low. But any more color there in terms of any abnormal seasonal buying patterns you're seeing or expecting? And maybe differences between some of those more R&R oriented home center customers versus the new residential side?
Eric Cremers : Yes. The only thing I would say is that customers are scrambling, trying to procure lumber. Inventories are at very, very low levels. Prices ran up, as you know, in the fourth quarter -- third quarter, fourth quarter of last year and now into the first quarter. And so nobody wants to buy lumber when it's $900 or $1,000 per 1,000, just they view it as too expensive and they think, oh, prices are going to come back down. Meanwhile, you've got unprecedented demand. I mean, look at where housing starts have played out over the past couple of months, look at how strong repair and remodel markets are Home Depot and Lowe's or the home centers are posting comps in the plus 20% to plus 30% kind of range, just really strong demand. So I think the entire supply chain has been caught off guard without enough inventory and now we're going into kind of the spring season where people need to start restocking, especially the treaters, and everybody has been behind on buying lumber because they think prices are going to come down. So our view is that inventories are very lean. And the reason we're seeing these prices because demand is insatiable.
Operator: Your next question is from Buck Horne from Raymond James.
Buck Horne : I kind of want to follow-on Kurt's question here, just ask a little bit about the sawmill capacity that's in your wood baskets, are you seeing any third party capital? Any other players that are taking the opportunity to get new greenfield sawmills underway in your particular wood basket? Are you seeing any signs of that starting to pop up?
Eric Cremers : Well, there have been a number of announcements here lately that are in or around our operating areas. Idaho Forest Group announced a new mill in Lumberton, Mississippi. It's probably too far away from our timberlands in Mississippi for us to supply them but they announced a new mill. Biewer Lumber announced a new mill in Winona, Mississippi. That one is, frankly, in our backyard. I'm sure we'll be supplying them with sawlogs as they get up and running. So there are a number of mills that are in and around our operating areas. But as Jerry mentioned, these mills when they start-up, the initial impact is maybe a little bump in sawlog prices, but then it quickly recedes. So that's kind of how it seems to play out, just excess amount of standing timber out there.
Buck Horne : And I guess transitioning maybe a little higher level, then I certainly want to agree with the housing outlook you guys laid out, and we certainly believe that the demand should remain pretty robust throughout 2021 for single-family new home sales. So I guess, part of the concern or the question is, I think there's a natural bias to be conservative that today's lumber prices, phased OSB prices are naturally going to taper off into year-end. But is there a scenario where I wouldn't say like 900 is the new normal, but is there a scenario that we're still just being too conservative with this expectation that prices are going to meaningfully drop by year-end?
Eric Cremers : Yes. I mean, that's really the $1 million question Buck, maybe even more than $1 million. But -- so we think what's happened in the marketplace is that housing starts have really surprised to the upside here. These latest numbers, 1.6 million, 1.7 million. Those are really strong numbers. If those housing starts numbers stay with us through the remainder of the year, our view is that lumber prices are going to stay elevated. If they come down to where people expect housing starts to come down to, say, around the 1.4 million, 1.5 million kind of range, you could see a little bit of a taper in lumber prices. Now that being said, we still think lumber prices are going to stay relatively high, especially given the COVID backdrop where it's costing us, in any given quarter, 5 million to 10 million feet of production. Take that 10 million feet across 4 quarters, that's 40 million feet out of 1 billion board feet that we produce, that's 4%. So if everybody across the industry is having to deal with COVID, and it's costing them 4% of capacity, well, that's just going to tighten industry conditions even more than it would be otherwise. So there is a scenario here where prices don't taper. And certainly, we're seeing that here in Q1.
Operator: And at this time, I'm showing there are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over back to Mr. Jerry Richards.
Jerald Richards : All right. Thank you, Christian, and thank you, everybody, for your interest in PotlatchDeltic, available the rest of the day to take your modeling questions, and hope everybody has a good day and stay safe.
Eric Cremers : Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."
