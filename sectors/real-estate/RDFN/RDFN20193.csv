"Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Redfin Corporation Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Elena Perron. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Elena Perron: Thank you, Brendon. Good afternoon, and welcome to Redfin's financial results conference call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019. Joining me on the call today are Glenn Kelman, our CEO; and Chris Nielsen, our CFO. You can find the press release on our website at investors.redfin.com.
Glenn Kelman: Thanks Elena and hi everyone. Redfin's third quarter revenues and net income were better than we projected in our last earnings call. Compared to the third quarter last year revenue was up 70% to $239 million and net income was up $3.3 million to $6.8 million. And our core business of brokering home sales through Redfin agents and through other firms' agents working as our partners, revenues increased 22%, compared to the same quarter last year. This was an acceleration from the second quarter's 17% year-over-year growth. The first quarter's 15% growth and the 13% growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our share gains also continued with 11 basis point gain from the third quarter of 2018. This is the same year-over-year gain we saw in the second quarter, and an improvement on the 10 point share gains we saw in each of the two quarters before that. RedfinNow are business of buying and selling homes on our own account, grew revenues from $11 million in the third quarter of 2018 to $80 million in the third quarter of 2019. Over that same time, our other businesses, primarily lending entitled services grew 92% an acceleration from the second quarter's 89% year-over-year growth and the first quarter's 59% year-over-year growth. Perhaps most important, third quarter gross margins improved year-over-year in all of our businesses. Year-over-year growth in the average monthly visitors to our website and mobile applications moderated from a rate of 27% in the second quarter to 22% in the third.
Chris Nielsen: Thanks Glen. We delivered another strong top line results quarter and improved gross margin in each in our reported segments. Third quarter revenue was $239 million, up 70% from a year ago. Real estate services revenue which includes our brokerage and partner businesses grew 22% year-over-year. Brokerage revenue or revenue from home sales closed by our own agents was up 23% on a 25% growth in brokerage transactions. Brokerage revenue per transaction was down 2% year-over-year, reflecting the continued mix shift towards our listing business and lower average home value as compared with the third quarter of 2018. Revenue from our partners was up 8% on a 5% increase in partner transactions. Revenue per partner transaction was up 3% year-over-year. The property segment, which consists of homes sold through our RedfinNow program, generated over $80 million in revenue, up from $11 million in the third quarter of 2018. In October 2019 we began to utilize our new $100 million asset backed credit facility, which we put in place last quarter. We continue to expect that overtime, the vast majority of capital to buy homes will come from lenders using the homes we buy as collateral. Our cash and cash equivalents including short and long-term government securities held for sale total over $309 million as of September 30, 2019. We are comfortable that this cash balance combined with our asset backed borrowing capacity will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our future growth for the foreseeable future. Our other segment, which includes mortgage title and other services, contributed revenue of $5 million a year-over-year increase of 92%. Total gross profit was $53.4 million, up 26% year-over-year. Real estate services gross margin was 35.1% up 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by 120 basis point decrease in personnel costs including stock-based compensation and transaction bonuses as a percentage of revenue. Properties gross margin was minus 0.9% up 180 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by a 140 basis point decrease in personnel costs including stock-based compensation and a 40 basis point decrease in listing expenses partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in the cost of properties, each as a percentage of revenue. Others segment had a gross margin of 0.9% and improvement of 1,500 basis points from a year ago as our mortgage and title businesses continue to scale. Total operating expenses increased 18% year-over-year and represented 19% of revenue down from 28% of revenue one year ago. Technology and development expenses increased 31% driven by an increase in personnel costs including stock-based compensation and higher occupancy and office expenses to support growth in our technology personnel. General and administrative expenses were 14% year-over-year, and marketing expenses increased just 2% as we did not run any offline advertising campaigns and saw slower growth in performance marketing channels during the quarter. Our net income including stock-based compensation and depreciation was $6.8 million, compared to a $3.5 million net income in the third quarter of 2018. Diluted earnings per share was $0.07 compared with $0.04 one year ago. Now turning to our financial expectations for the fourth quarter of 2019. Revenues expected to be between $211 million and $220 million representing year-over-year growth between 70% and 77%. We expect our property segment to account for $80 million to $85 million of that revenue. Net loss is expected to be between $12.8 million and $9.5 million, compared with the $12.2 million net loss in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our guidance includes approximately $7.6 million of stock-based compensation and $2.7 million of depreciation and amortization. It assumes among other things that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements are concluded that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. And with that we'll open up for your questions.
Operator: Thank you.  We'll take our first question from Tom White with DA Davidson. Please go ahead with your question, sir.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this actually focuses. Thanks for taking my question. So just in your mortgage business, is that one in four attach rate in the realm of what you're targeting long term? We're just trying to better understand unit economics and mortgage. So any color you can provide on say average loan amounts or gain on sale that you're targeting will be helpful. Thank you.
Chris Nielsen: We're not discussing gain on sale with investors at this point. 25% attach rate is an aggressive target in the near term. But I think we can do better than that in the long term. It depends on great sales execution, but also great pricing. And today we just have a significant cost advantage of our competitors which were partially able to pass on the customers. So I think the real upside on the mortgage business beyond the brokerage attach rate is just the fact that we have 36 million visitors on Redfin.com. Many of whom are not going to use an agent from Redfin because their uncle or their best friend is a real estate agent, but who would be completely open to a Redfin Mortgage. So that team is chomping at the bit to have us turn on the big spigot and promote Redfin Mortgage on our website. We still feel that the website is probably under monetized because the main monetization channel is just the brokerage. So as soon as we can scale to that demand, we will. Today that team is hiring hand over fist and we just want to protect the culture on the quality of service.
Operator: Thank you.  The next question will Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Jason Deleeuw: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just from a strategic and kind of how you're thinking about running a business. It seems like with the marketing spend as a percentage of revenue being less. Your better qualifying customers' performance standards for agents. It seems like there's an increased focus on managing the business for margin versus growth. Not that the growth is bad it's just that seems like you're more focused on the margin front. So is that the case? And just kind of give us your thoughts on that. And then also the agent productivity. There used to be 34 transactions a year. Looks like we're going to be around there again this year. What's kind of the target? Or what can we think about? Or just remind us the range that you have for agent productivity? Thank you.
Glenn Kelman: So I'll talk about margin versus growth. And then Chris, do you want to address agent productivity?
Chris Nielsen: Sure.
Glenn Kelman: I don't think we've shifted our tone on margins versus growth. We want both. We've always been clear, though, that we are in a mid-margin business that we have to be disciplined about our costs that we're going to run this business from the cash register whenever we can. There have been investments in new businesses that are somewhat capital intensive. But fundamentally, we want to make sure everyone knows that we know how to make money. So maybe the emphasis on profit was stronger in this call when we talked about RedfinNow. And I think that's because we realized that in the broader space, there are companies that have a higher risk tolerance that are more aggressive about growth in the properties business than we are. We know that everyone is going to want to evaluate an instant offer, but we think we have to be really picky about which houses we buy. So growth is the easy part in the properties business, because it's such a novel product, and because it's so easy to sell dollar bills for $0.95. So I think we just have to be really careful when we look at the properties business which is growing 600% year-over-year that we grow that business in a responsible way. So if you were looking for a shift in tone, it probably came there. But almost everything else is the way that we've always been. And even with RedfinNow, I feel like that's the way we've always been. But the market has just had a different view that other players in the space have been more growth oriented. So we wanted to be clear about where we stand.
Chris Nielsen: And then in terms of agent productivity, we are pleased we've continued to see agent productivity tick up in each of the quarters so far this year. That's what we expected as we increased the number of customers that each of our agents was meeting, really starting in the latter part of 2018. The biggest opportunity for that going forward is what Glenn mentioned on the call and that's just related to home buyer success rate, helping more customers get all the way through to a close transaction. We continue to meet a lot of customers are really interested in purchasing homes. And we do, again as Glenn mentioned have a variety of programs underway to help those customers get through to closings. And that's the biggest opportunity as it relates to improving agent productivity overtime.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question, sir.
Jason Helfstein: Thanks. Question, then the follow up on the profitability. Can you expand a bit more about the takeaways from Austin and Boston? Just having all those product offerings in one market. And then how you think about expanding that in terms of all of your markets overtime? And then just specifically, and then on profitability the business is showing better profitability, broadly, the guidance implies better margins in the fourth quarter. Can you comment next year, do you expect to be EBITDA breakeven for the year or better? Thanks.
Glenn Kelman: Hi, Jason, we're not commenting on next year. I want to emphasize that growth is accelerated and we've got more leverage. So hopefully we can have our cake and eat it too. The main engines for this growth have been in the core brokerage itself, but also in these ancillary businesses mortgage and title, make your questions about Austin and Boston relate to direct access to properties, direct offers, that is not going to affect our near-term profitability or even drive near-term growth. It is a long-term bet that we can change in a very fundamental way the real estate market. We believe there's a segment of customers who want full service and there's another segment of customers, who want to do it themselves. And we want to have the best product for each. And so that customer segment that wants to do it itself is the new segment and it's the one we really want to have a leadership role developing.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Jack Micenko with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead with your question.
Jack Micenko: Hi. Glenn, I think in the prepared comments, you talked about where you're active in RedfinNow, your market share increases have been greater. And so thinking through that it's been angel debate, whether this is driving sales, or seller leads or not. Do you think it's brand awareness that's driving that market share with RedfinNow in the market, or do you think you're starting to see real progress in terms of seller leads from being at that instant offer whether they take it or decide to listen for it anyway?
Glenn Kelman: I don't think it's general brand awareness that RedfinNow drives, it drives more seller inquiries. Now the controversy around that is when RedfinNow buys the house, it hires the Redfin brokerage to list it. So every RedfinNow home turns into a Redfin brokerage listing. So there's that direct contribution to listing share that it's incontrovertible. And there are some customers, who contact us about RedfinNow, who I don't think would have contacted us for the brokerage just because RedfinNow is a more differentiated product. So that's just incremental. Where I still think there's upside for Redfin and the other players in the property space is when someone evaluates an instant offer and says, it's actually too low. I'm going to go ahead and list my property. We've really tried to have an integrated sales experience we're right away the real estate agent says. Well, let me help you with that. And sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. We're working hard on that, and we've made good progress. But I still want more. So that's the area where I think we can have a more seamless sales experience and a better overall capture rate from the inquiries.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Ygal Arounian with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead with your question, sir.
Ygal Arounian: Hi, guys, thanks for the questions. So I want to ask on, what specifically drove the decrease in personnel costs, the contribution to the gross margin and real estate services? I know last quarter, you had talked about the increased costs in touring, and I know you're addressing some of that sounds like long-term as well. Did that help contribute to costs and this quarter? And then maybe talk a little bit about the reference direct expansion. I know you expanded into Texas and you're looking to expand it further over the course of the year. What are your expectations there at this point? And you're starting to close the question transactions there and how we think about how that contributes to growth and margins, at least through the end of this year and as much as you're willing to share about next year. Thanks.
Glenn Kelman: Sure, let me start with the question on real estate services, gross margin, those did primarily improve related to personnel expenses as a percentage of revenue. And not only did we get improvement in agent productivity, but support staff productivity in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to third quarter of 2018. Part of that, just as a reminder is that the real estate market try to slow down in the third quarter of 2018. And so that was a headwind on productivity over that period of time. But just generally, we were quite pleased with all the staff productivity. And on your question related to home touring expenses. That was a big headwind in the second quarter that was left in the third quarter. And so we're hopeful that some of the changes we've been making earlier in the funnel to help qualify customers contributed to that time will tell whether that's the entire driver or not.
Chris Nielsen: On Redfin Direct it is just a little baby Ygal. Mortgage was this way two years ago and people were wondering if it was going to have a significant financial contribution. And we counseled patients, in the same way we are counseling patients with Direct. We have been pleased that how easy it is to expand. There are some industry headwinds where we have to make sure that the local real estate commission really understands what we're doing, but it's totally aboveboard. And it's going to expand relatively quickly. I just think the challenge is going to be making sure that people can get through the process of preparing an offer without a real estate agent and really driving completion rate on that form and conversion rate for Redfin listings to turn into sales without an agent. So that'll take some time. But I think do you think the trend is only going in one direction. And it's important that you have a portfolio of businesses with different growth rates and maturities, because at one point, a year from now, two years from now, three years from now, we think this could be a significant driver of profits. It's a very high margin business segment.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from John Campbell with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question, sir.
John Campbell: Hey, guys, good afternoon and congrats on the continued success. But Glenn, I've got one more on direct offers. And don't worry, we're going to stay patient there. But you guys have rolled that out. And I guess a handful of markets now it's only on Redfin for sell properties. But I think recently, maybe a couple months ago, you guys started to solicit feedback around basically open that up outside of Redfin and come into the broader industry, but I'm curious about how that's gone so far. And what if any pushback you might have received?
Glenn Kelman: John not a sparrow falls without your noticing it. We try to be sneaky about that. Just because our diabolical plans haven't been announced to the world. So at some point, it makes sense for us to let other agents including the agents who have complained about Redfin Direct, put that button on their own listings because it's good for their clients, and it's actually good for their own business. I don't think we're quite ready to do it yet. But the results of the survey you asked about where we asked the agents, would you be willing to do this, work good. Plenty of agents would be interested in doing it.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Chen: Great, thanks. This is Mike Chen on for mark. On properties gross margin and nicely reached a record highs. So I was wondering if you could talk about some of the other future levers of expansion for this segment and when we could possibly think about positive margins. And also on RedfinNow. You've expanded to several new cities this quarter. Now you're up to 10. I was just wondering if you had any changed views on the buyer opportunity and how we should think about the pace of market expansion over the next several quarters.
Glenn Kelman: So the properties business is going to be part of Redfin for the foreseeable future. We think consumers are going to want to evaluate that option. I don't know that we're going to be very aggressive about expanding markets because it's so operationally intensive. So we are now branding our own vans and filling them up with vanity counters and sinks and all this other stuff to be able to fix up the houses that we buy and faster we get those vans rolling around the city, the less money we have to waste paying for the loan to get cut and the taxes and maintenance fees and the capital that we'd borrowed to buy the house. So I think our focus is going to be more on gaining share within the market than expanding to other markets, that will probably pick the balanced view of that but it will shade to our concentration. And then the levers on profit, are really the ones that we already discussed. Operational excellence and just grinding on margin, something that we really pride ourselves on because we’ve been in a cost sensitive business for so long. We’ve been the value leader for so long. We view the property’s business as a raise to the bottom. Nobody cares whether the check came from Redfin or somebody else, they care about the amount. And so, this is an economic war that we feel well equipped to fight. Having said that pricing is just so important, if you mis-price to house by 5,000 or 10,000 bucks no matter how many efficiency gains you get on knowing the loan for $55 instead of $60 a week. It’s just doesn’t matter. So, that is the software problem. It’s a software problem, we’ve been working on for a long time. The fact that our machine learning team just came up with another outstanding increase and accuracy for estimate, we feel good about it. We’ve also made some organizational changes so that we have more governance on who gets the price to home, how much financial expertise that person has, centralizing some of those decisions and managing by exception has really been beneficial to us, so I don’t want to make forward-looking statements about when RedfinNow is going to make money, but I will tell you that we’re just very tough on that business. Yeah, we fold our arms, Chris and I and say you think you’re going to make my, prove it to me. Because there’s so many ways you can baloney yourself on this one and the addressable market, the size of the market goes up and down depending on your willingness to take risk, and lose money.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Thomas Champion with Cowen. Please go ahead with your question, sir.
Thomas Champion: Hi, good afternoon. Given de minimis loss at RedfinNow, I'm just curious if it’s safe to assume that maybe you’re seeing some better profitability in early markets like England Empire and maybe San Diego. Just curious any comment on the profitability of now in any of your older markets. And then also noticed that in the brokerage business you launched in I think Savannah, maybe in Tennessee and Northern Kentucky, these struck me as generally smaller markets and I'm just curious if your thought on the size requirements in order to support services have changed at all, whether or not you can actually operate the core brokerage business in smaller places? Thank you.
Glenn Kelman: Let me start with the second question first, so related to real estate sort of the expansion, brokerage expansion, we have added a few markets recently. We will continue to do that, and mostly those are opportunistic around multiple distinct services that are combining or areas that are adjacent to places we’re already operating. So, you shouldn’t think about our stance with regard to going into many smaller markets is any different. We’ll do that opportunistically, but it’s not a core strategy for the company.
Chris Nielsen: And the question about vintages in RedfinNow are older markets running at higher margins. We’re trying not to segment this market by market because, it’s such a craft show quarter by quarter, market by market that we resolved so really going to vary wildly. I think the question we have is, we organize markets and the cohorts is whether we should do that by vantage, where profits just improve as we gain more market experience, or whether we should do that by home type so if you go to Denver, Dallas, probably Phoenix it’s ground zero for I buy. You have a commodity product, it’s at a reasonable price so you can drive significant volume and that let you train the algorithms better to, but it’s also just a competitive frenzy. And then you go to the coastal markets where you have to do more renovations, there's a lot of older properties. But if you fix them up, there's a big gain on sale. So those are almost two different businesses. And we have significant traffic in the coastal markets. A bigger brokerage footprint in the coastal markets, and some strong Home Services capabilities. Just generally we've invested in that area, both for RedfinNow but also this business we talked about in past calls concierge where we fixed up a customer's home and get more money for the customer. So I think that's the more interesting way to subdivide our profits. And we're still exploring which one of those cohorts is going to be most profitable. Obviously, the coastal cohort is higher risk. So even if you have alpha there, you also have plenty of beta.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys, this is Adam on for Heath. Thanks for taking the questions. On pricing, it looked like revenue per transaction was down on the brokerage side. Any update to the way you're thinking about the balance between the seller commission reductions and buyer rebates? Or is this more a function of top 10 markets coming down as a percent of total and that continued progress there? And then if you could just delineate if there's been any change to the level of demand you're seeing from the buyer and the seller side? Thanks a lot.
Glenn Kelman: Yeah. So revenue per transaction was down a bit third quarter versus third quarter last year. If you looked at that sequentially from the second quarter to third quarter, that's pretty typically what we see. So it's partially influenced by the types of homes in the market that tend to be in the third quarter. And then there is some pressure from what you mentioned in terms of the top 10 markets as a percentage of revenue headed down a bit over time. But fundamentally, we don't have a different view on what our pricing will look like. We think about it as a combined set of revenue between buyers and sellers.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Andrew Hargreaves with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question, sir.
Andrew Hargreaves: Thanks. Wondering if you could provide a little more detail on the performance standard changes you guys are making it one just the impetus and sort of key metrics you guys will be focusing on. And then how you're expecting that to impact hiring and volume?
Glenn Kelman: Sure. So the impetus behind these performance standards for real estate agents is just a broader shift that we discussed some in the last call toward a value driven sales force. In some ways, I've been the opponent of running a sales force here at Redfin, because the whole premise of the company is to be a customer advocate and not to turn the real estate consumer upside down and shake every penny out of her pocket. But we found that we were sometimes too passive when dealing with a customer. So the customer wasn't sure which neighborhood to be in which home to buy. And we would say, well, just let us know when you make up your mind because we don't want to pressure you into the wrong purchase, when really we needed to step forward and say, here are three neighborhoods that are up and coming here are five listings that I think would be a really good fit for your family. Let's work on this together. And so having a sales force that is more proactive, but still driven by the values of the company to be different than every other brokerage, and to take care of the customer and to tell that customer to walk away from the wrong deal is the balance we're trying to strike. It's a huge cultural shift. And I think it's absolutely crucial. Because, for the longest time, the engine of our growth has been our website and most employees at the company, real estate agents have not had a role in driving growth. They basically have been relegated to some kind of fulfillment role. And they want to be those partners. And so the performance standards are just about being very clear that if you meet a bunch of customers from our website, and none of them end up buying a home, maybe that was bad luck, but over time, they're voting with their feet. And where we become more skeptical is we used to survey customers based on whether they were happy with their agent. And that was the measure of an agent's performance. Except that all the people who ended up buying a home filled out the survey and all the people who didn't fill out the survey. And so I think we take a closed sale as the most sincere expression of confidence in the agents' service and telling the agents that if you're going to meet a bunch of customers who've been sourced from our website, you got to keep up your end of the bargain and really knock their socks off. So we look every month at a number of customers they met and how many of them ended up sticking with us and how many ended up successfully buying a home. And if people are way off the budget, we then say this is what's going to happen to you, you're going to go on a performance improvement plan, we're going to try to coach you to do better, but also ultimately, we have to ask you to leave. And so I think it'll improve the quality of our workforce and improve the quality of our service and doing everything through programs and more questions on web forms. And everything except a better agent we have only going to get us so far. Having a better workforce is going to do wonders for the business in my view.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question, sir.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking the question. This is Alex on for Brent. So the reacceleration of revenue growth you're seeing on the brokerage side, can you help us size how much of that you believe is macro improvements over last year versus fundamental share gains, and then understand you're not going to provide any color for next year but as we move forward and you comp a year of heavy marketing spend, should we expect some stabilization in brokerage revenue growth? Thanks.
Glenn Kelman: Oh, man tough question. Fortunately, we report on shared gains explicitly to try to address the tailwinds and headwinds of the housing market. And some of our revenue growth is driven by that tailwind we do have a soft comparison to the third quarter of last year, but market share growth is also up. We were doing 10 basis points to share growth couple quarters ago for two quarters straight and now we've elevated that to 11 basis points. So I do think there is durable brokerage share growth that is separate from a tailwind in the market. After next year, yes, we're going to be comparing ourselves to 2019 when we had elevated levels of marketing spend, but I think we're going to have better sales execution and higher close rates. So with strong traffic growth and awareness that pays dividends over multiple years I feel reasonably good about next year. I'm trying to say this in a sufficiently vague way that lawyers and Investor Relations folks want me to, but hot Dang it, I think we're going to do pretty well.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from…
Glenn Kelman: Can we legally comfort hot Dang?
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Naved Khan with SunTrust Robinson, Humphrey. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. This is Robert Taylor  on for Naved. What early positive or negative trends are from consumers using the direct access are you seeing and what are you learning about consumer behavior here. And is there any color you can provide on effort to improve conversion rates from tours? Thank you.
Glenn Kelman: The thing that struck me is that they're normal. I remember when we launched Redfin, 10, 15 years ago, the people who first tried our service, were some pretty odd ducks. You just had to be a little bit crazy to put your faith in Redfin when it was three or four of us in an apartment. And so I sort of expected that it would be oddballs all over again with Redfin Direct. I wanted to know the profile of the person buying that house, I thought maybe it would be a millennial who grew up buying her textbooks off Amazon.com, but too often boomers who say I bought five houses. I know how this works, saw the place on my own, and I know what I want to pay for it. So that's been reassuring to me. I don't know that we have such a  to cross demographically, because young and old folks have been using this product. I almost feel it more mechanically as I don't know how many screens there are, I forget, but there are a lot. And the drop from screen to screen to screen is something that a product manager and engineer just loves to geek out on where you work harder and harder to improve that and it's a very straightforward problem. So I'm sure that there are cultural issues will have to address but the most straightforward one is just to make the web form better.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Josh  with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, and good afternoon. This point most of my questions have been asked. So maybe I'll just double back on hires. Hoping you can walk us through your expectation for agent hires in 2020. Maybe how we should wait your comments about a better housing backdrop, and the potential for agent attrition in 2020. And also if you're focused on the top 10 markets, or more broadly based, that would be helpful. Thanks.
Chris Nielsen: Sure. So generally, in terms of hiring agents, we do that based on the demand we're seeing in those local markets. We've already put together projections for what we expect in all the places in which we operate, and we'll hire into that in the early part of the year. And then as we get into February and March will adjust hiring based on what we're actually seeing for those Final sets of hire. So you shouldn't expect that we approach hiring in any different way this next year than we did in the past several years. It's based on the demand that we see.
Glenn Kelman: I think we're getting better candidates for what it's worth. The brand awareness has helped the share gains have helped. The income difference really matters. Our agents earn a good living.
Operator: Thank you. The final question will come from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates.
Ryan McKeveny: Thank you so much. So one quick follow up on a couple of questions ago about the performance standards. I'm curious does that entail any change to the actual compensation structure with agents like the kind of split between salary and bonus? And then just a separate question, I'm curious - totally separate topic, but on the buyer side of things, with the markets with the open door relationship versus your own market, I'm just curious is there is there much of a difference in either the agent or the consumer experience? Anything regarding from just doing it in the partnership fashion versus doing it yourself threads and now. Any comments along those lines would be very helpful. Thank you.
Glenn Kelman: Sure. So we have not made major changes to the compensation plan, there is a new level called principal agent for some of our best performing agents. And that rewards not just productivity or customer success rate, but also customer loyalty. If you've been at Redfin for 5, 6, 8 years as an agent, you often can be off the website for six, nine months out of the year because so many customers are asking for you by name, their referrals, the repeat business and all the rest. So we want those agents to earn a premium because they're so profitable for us and recognizing them as principal agents is probably the harbinger of other changes where we continue to encourage our agents to use the website to build the book of business but then also invest in that book of business over time where the check it in on clients are sending holiday cards. Because obviously online loyalty programs can be effective but it makes a difference when your agent's in the neighborhood and stops by to say hi. As far as what we've learned from open door, it's just that they put together they offer faster. We're very careful about how much we're willing to pay and I'm sure open door is too. But that process for them is more efficient than it is for us. And I can only assume that it helps drive offer acceptance rate. So that has driven us to raise our game. Those guys have been doing instant offers for a long time. And they really put the instant - an instant offer.
