Spencer Rascoff: Thank you for joining the call today to discuss our third quarter 2016 financial results. Zillow Group delivered strong third-quarter results that exceeded our expectations, and that demonstrated progress in executing our strategic priorities. Total revenue for the quarter grew 35% year-over-year to a record of approximately $225 million and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. The increase in revenue was driven by strong contributions from each of our marketplaces, but primarily from the Premier Agent business, which grew revenue 33% year- over-year to more than $158 million, also ahead of our outlook. On the bottom line, GAAP net income was $6.8 million, or 3% of revenue, and third-quarter EBITDA was $59.5 million, or 26% of revenue. Our profitability this quarter was well ahead of our expectations and an exception to our typical cadence of steady year-over-year margin expansion. The outperformance in profitability was primarily driven by strong revenue results and operating expense savings, which Kathleen will discuss in a moment. As we entered the second half of 2016, we continued to gain momentum from the first two quarters. Total revenue growth has accelerated across our business throughout the year, and all our marketplaces are performing strongly. With just one quarter left in 2016, we are on track to deliver full-year revenue growth of better than 30% year-over-year. We are excited to finish 2016 strong, with a continued focus on our four strategic priorities, growing our audience size, growing our Premier Agent business, growing our emerging marketplaces, and attracting and retaining the best talent in the technology, media and real estate industries. We are making great progress against each of those strategic priorities. Our audience across all of Zillow Group’s mobile applications and websites continues to grow in an expanding category. Zillow Group’s market share remained substantial as our traffic lead persisted. According to comScore, all five of Zillow Group’s consumer brands combined represented nearly two thirds of the total online real estate category in September and nearly three quarters of the category on mobile only. Average monthly unique users for the quarter grew 16% year-over-year to more than 164 million, reaching a seasonal high point in July with nearly 170 million unique users. Traffic to the Zillow mobile apps and website hit a new record high, while traffic to the Trulia mobile apps and website grew steadily year-over-year and contributed meaningfully to Zillow Group’s overall audience leadership. We are able to achieve these impressive audience numbers by building great products that consumers love, and then effectively marketing our brands through earned and paid media. This growth is a testament to our product, engineering and marketing teams’ excellence. Turning to our Premier Agent marketplace, revenue grew 33% year-over-year. The nation’s best real estate agents – those who convert leads at high rates – are gaining transaction share in their respective markets as a result of advertising on Zillow Group’s platform. Our Premier Agent program provides our advertisers with a tremendous opportunity to grow their business in the form of high- quality leads connected with software. During the third quarter, we delivered 4.6 million leads to Premier Agent advertisers across our brands’ mobile apps and websites. This was an increase of nearly 40% year-over-year. As a reminder, the growth rate of leads is expected to normalize in 2017 when we begin comparisons to greater lead volume resulting from Trulia’s traffic improvement in early 2016. That said, we expect the growth rate in leads will continue to be greater than the growth rate of unique users in the near term. We recently announced the launch of exciting new features to our Premier Agent platform that will drive even more leads to our advertisers. In October, we launched our Seller Boost program, which is an ad product that connects Premier Agents with prospective home-sellers from Zillow and Trulia. Additionally, we launched the Premier Agent Direct program, which promotes our Premier Agent advertisers on Facebook. Buying ads on Facebook using Zillow Group’s precision targeting allows real estate agents, teams or brokerages to expand the audience to whom they advertise through our simple platform. Meanwhile, we continue to invest heavily in our Premier Agent app, adding important functionality for our advertisers with the goal of improving their lead conversion. Recent features include better lead routing and lead ingestion from other lead sources. The free Premier Agent app is rapidly becoming a full-featured business management platform which can handle all of an agent’s, team’s, or broker’s workflow. We have also started to roll out our self-serve account interface to Premier Agents nationally, with a goal of completing the rollout by the end of the year. After testing, and based on feedback and data from our advertisers, we now provide account management tools that enable our advertisers to independently control their budgets and impression buys. This flexibility and control strengthens our partnership with Premier Agents and facilitates their growth on our platform. This transition introduces some uncertainty in the near-term in regard to Premier Agent revenue, and we have incorporated sensitivity for this into our outlook for Q4. We recently modified and extended our Premier Agent program to accommodate brokers’ needs. The Premier Broker program allows brokers to purchase impressions and route leads to agents at their firms. We provide brokers with a tool to monitor performance of their agents through our Premier Agent app platform to ensure that leads are responded to within a reasonable timeframe. Including brokerages as Premier advertisers brings additional advertiser liquidity into our marketplace, provides consumers with better service, and improves our overall partnership with the brokerage community. Turning now to our third strategic priority -- growing our emerging marketplaces including rentals, mortgages and New York City. We’ve been very successful here, and each of these emerging marketplaces is growing even faster than our core Premier Agent business. These newer marketplaces together will bring in annual revenue this year that’s nearly three times larger than all of Zillow at our IPO five years ago. Our Mortgages marketplace once again performed very well in the third quarter. Revenue grew 57% year-over-year and we are on track to exceed $70 million for the full year. In the third quarter, we completely overhauled the lender directory and the Mortgages ratings and reviews platform. Enterprises and individual loan officers now have more flexibility in managing the presentation of their profiles with consumer feedback on our mobile apps and websites, which is a big win for consumers and our lender partners. Our Rentals marketplace once again experienced year-over-year revenue growth that exceeded 100% for the third quarter. According to comScore, the Zillow Group brands of Zillow, Trulia and Hotpads are now three of the top four brands in the rental category.2 In addition to Premier Agent Direct, we launched a similar partnership with Facebook for rentals, which enables our multi-family advertisers to buy Facebook ads through us using our precision targeting. Our New York City marketplace continues to grow rapidly across both of our New York brands -- StreetEasy and Naked Apartments. These platforms provide New York home shoppers and their real estate agents with accurate for-sale and for-rent listings from thousands of landlords and real estate brokerages throughout New York City. StreetEasy is testing a new lead product for open rentals, which are apartments marketed by multiple agents. Representing the first integration between the StreetEasy and Naked Apartments teams, this product brings new inventory to StreetEasy, creating a more comprehensive search experience of available New York apartments. It also helps agents connect with StreetEasy’s unparalleled audience of New York renters. Both brands continue to generate significant PR in New York City, with StreetEasy positioned as the media’s primary resource for New York real estate information. Our fourth strategic priority -- which is crucial to the success of everything we do here at Zillow Group – is attracting and retaining the best talent while maintaining our unique company culture focused on innovation. Our people and culture are key competitive advantages. We strongly believe that great people build great products, which in turn attract audience. We dedicate significant resources and focus at Zillow Group toward creating an environment in which our more than 2,600 employees can do their best work. I am thrilled to say that Zillow Group employees continue to positively rate their experience working here in our regular anonymous surveys. In addition, I’m proud to report that Trulia employee reviews on Glassdoor are now at their highest level since the merger with Zillow, highlighting a successful integration. This positive feedback supports our efforts in attracting the best talent to Zillow Group so we can continue innovating in the online real estate media space. I’d like to extend my sincere thanks to all of Zillow Group’s hard working employees for contributing to our ongoing success. Now, turning to our outlook for the year, we are raising our full-year 2016 revenue outlook range to $837 to $842 million and our EBITDA outlook range to $136 to $141 million, excluding the litigation settlement charge from last quarter. We are in growth mode and focused on our long-term strategy to drive audience and revenue growth along with steady margin expansion. Our long-term target of more than 40% EBITDA margin at scale remains intact. As we approach 2017, we remain focused on growing our audience across all Zillow Group brands and delivering more high-quality leads to advertisers. To do this, we are investing heavily in our products – tools like DotLoop and our Premier Agent app – to improve lead conversion and improve the efficiency of Premier Agents. As part of our disciplined approach to grow through investment, we will continue to deliver steady margin expansion over time. We will discuss our 2017 outlook further when we finalize our annual plan and report our full year 2016 results next year. Agents and homebuilders are spending nearly $11 billion annually on advertising3, and the portion of that dedicated to online and mobile advertising increases each year. In addition, our emerging marketplaces – Mortgages, Rentals and New York City – represent several billion more in online advertising spending that we’ve just begun to address. With that in mind, we are very excited about the future for Zillow Group. I will now turn it over to Kathleen.
Kathleen Philips: Thank you, Spencer, and hello to everyone joining us on today’s call. Let’s dive into our financial results. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 27% year-over-year to a record of $224.6 million from $176.8 million in the same period last year. Excluding Market Leader from last year’s results, which was divested in the third quarter of 2015, total revenue increased 35% year-over-year. Looking at our primary revenue category, Marketplace revenue was $206.9 million for the third quarter, an increase of 35% year-over-year. Excluding Market Leader from last year’s results, Marketplace revenue increased 45% year-over-year. Marketplace revenue now accounts for 92% of our total revenue as compared to 87% during the same period last year. As a reminder, our Marketplace category includes Premier Agent, Other Real Estate and Mortgages revenue. Zillow Group Premier Agent revenue increased 33% year-over-year to a record $158.3 million in the third quarter. The annualized run rate for our agent advertising marketplace reached $626 million at the end of the quarter, compared to $468 million at the same time last year. We ended the quarter with 89,147 agent advertisers, a modest and expected decline from the end of the second quarter of 2016. For the third quarter of 2016, average revenue per advertiser, or ARPA, was $585, increasing 46% year-over-year. As a reminder, we will no longer report on the number of agent advertisers and ARPA beginning in 2017. Revenue from same agent advertisers, or those who have been on our platform for more than one year, grew by more than 59% compared to the prior year. New sales to existing advertisers made up 71% of total bookings in the third quarter. Year-over-year growth of the agent advertiser cohort that spends more than $5,000 per month was 80% on a total dollar basis, and 79% in advertiser count. Churn in this cohort continues to be minimal. We continue to support more agent teams and independent brokers who buy advertising at much higher levels than the average. We are accelerating the broader trend across the real estate agent population of higher-producing agents gaining market share from those who are less productive. Third quarter revenue for our Other Real Estate subcategory grew 182% year-over-year to $28.8 million. Other Real Estate Revenue includes agent services, Dollop, StreetEasy, Naked Apartments, rentals and other offerings to our endemic advertisers that are not traditional display advertising. Moving now to our Mortgages marketplace, our revenue reached $19.8 million in the quarter, which represents a 57% increase year-over-year. Average revenue per loan information request increased 191% year-over-year. Our strategic decision to improve the quality of loan information requests during the first quarter of 2016 by asking consumers to provide more details before a request is sent to a lender resulted in a 46% decrease of such requests year-over-year. We view this as a continuing positive trend, and these changes have increased consumer and advertiser adoption of mortgage advertising products that yield higher revenue. In our Display category, revenue was $17.7 million, a decrease of approximately 25% over the same period last year, and within our expectations. Our intentional shift from traditional display advertising revenue continues, as we focus on providing consumers with personalized experiences that lead to valuable connections for our marketplace advertisers. Moving now from revenue to our expenses. Total operating expenses were $216.8 million in the third quarter. Taking a closer look at our operating expenses by line item: Our cost of revenue during the quarter was $18.3 million, or 8% of revenue. Sales and marketing expense was $92.8 million, or 41% of revenue. We continue to make strategic and opportunistic investments in advertising, which support the expansion of our audience leadership in the online real estate category. Technology and development costs in the third quarter were $69.2 million, or 31% of revenue. General and administrative costs in the third quarter were $37.7 million, or 17% of revenue, and lower than we had planned. Moving on to our bottom line, GAAP net income reached a record $6.8 million, or 3% of revenue, GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share was 4 cents. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $59.5 million, or 26% of revenue, well above guidance due to revenue outperformance and operating expense savings throughout the company. Zillow Group ended the third quarter with more than 2,600 employees and approximately $445 million in cash and investments. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. I encourage you to review our press release that was issued this afternoon. It is available on our investor relations website and includes detailed fourth quarter and full year 2016 guidance and related GAAP reconciliations. Fourth quarter 2016 total revenue is expected to be in the range of $218 to $223 million. Premier Agent revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $161 to $163 million. Display revenue is expected to be in the range of $14 to $15 million. EBITDA in the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $46 to $51 million. For the full year 2016, we are raising our total revenue outlook to a range of $837 to $842 million and our Premier Agent revenue outlook to a range of $601 to $603 million. We also are raising our display revenue outlook to a range of $66 to $67 million. EBITDA for the full year 2016 is expected in the range of $136 to $141 million. For illustrative purposes, this EBITDA outlook range excludes the impact of our $130 million June litigation settlement. Our third-quarter performance was excellent and we beat all expectations for the quarter, including our own. We expect to end the year strong and will enter 2017 in an outstanding position to continue growing our business and audience share. Even with all of the progress we have made establishing Zillow Group as the leader in the online real estate category, there is still much opportunity ahead. With that, we will now open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital. Your question please.
Mark Mahaney: In terms of the guidance for the fourth quarter it looks like it's pretty much similar to what you just -- what you had implied in annual guidance before. Now you obviously had some nice outperformance this quarter and Spencer in your opening remarks you talk about this little bit of -- I'm sorry the sensitivity in the outlook related to this change in some of the management tools. Can you just go through those. Is that why you want to be a little bit more cautious and not flow through to some of the upside you're seeing into the third quarter to the fourth quarter how material could variance be due to these new account management tools? Thank you.
Spencer Rascoff: Sure. We've been testing different interface for the purchase of our add products both what agent used to add as well as what our salespeople's use which give the advertiser more control and more visibility into what they are buying. We rolled it out to about a quarter of the country up till now and we've learned a lot along the way and we've Incorporated those learnings and as we roll it out to the remaining three quarters of the country over the next couple of weeks between now and the end of the year there is always uncertainty whenever you make also changes like that to our biggest revenue line and so we've incorporated that and added uncertainty into our Q4 numbers so that’s what's that's in regards to Mark.
Mark Mahaney: Okay and Spencer if I could in the quarter that you've seen it rolled out to so far I assume that you are essentially giving your customers kind of more control over their and -- spend I would assume this is something they would want to have is this something you see as being positively embraced by the first 25%, so you just want to be unknown or careful about the next 75%?
Spencer Rascoff: Yes, that was a good characterization of it. We started testing this new interface and the new advertising visibility almost a year ago in just a couple of cities and then we made some changes along the way we rolled it out to a region to a second region and now it's out and about a quarter of the country the results have been good so far but we want to be cautious and circumspect as we roll it out to the remainder of the country because you always introduce risk when you make changes like this but thus far we've been pleased and obviously that's why we are continuing to roll it out nationwide.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your questions please.
Unidentified Analyst: I'm actually interested in your mortgage business, some of your competitors who are more focused on the refi space got affected by Brexit causing thanks to see a sudden drop in rates and people basically walking in the door thus less demand for their leads. Is this affect the purchase base as much for you guys and do you think your results were in any way impacted?
Spencer Rascoff: We have not seen an impact from Brexit on our mortgage business. Low rates overall improve traffic and contacts in our mortgage business for refi requests but we are mostly focus on purchase request which really are not rate sensitive. So by far the biggest driver of our mortgage business is traffic and purchase loan request as a result of home shopper activity. So in that regard we are quite different from other online lead generation businesses in the mortgage space which primarily reliant low rates to generate refi business in our case Zillow Group mortgages is attached of course to two of the largest real estate search portals Trulia and Zillow and so most of our business is purchase and therefore not affected by rates changes or by things like prices.
Unidentified Analyst: I was just going to say that leads into a next question which actually relates on traffic. Obviously traffic growth every part of your business but you are seeing for the first time a sequential decline in Q3. Is this the normal seasonality that we should expect to build on going forward with Q2 being a much bigger spike than it has been in the past and then Q3 falling off going down to Q4 and then back up again as you come through the year?
Spencer Rascoff: Yes this is normal seasonality in the online real estate space. Every company in the category has quarter over quarter declines as you go into Q3 and Q4. Home shopping slows down between really Thanksgiving and the Super Bowl and so traffic tends to decline in Q3, Q4 and then spikes back up in Q1. So our year-over-year numbers for traffic is what you really have to look and it's not growing very quickly approximately 16% and of course even more importantly leads to premier agents growing around 40%. As I explained in the script that we aspire for lead growth to exceed unique user growth but 40% plus year-over-year lead growth is unsustainable we are lapping easier comps as and as we start to lap harder comps from Trulia's traffic improvements the year-over-year lead growth will slow somewhat but it's still faster than traffic. In the case of mortgages which started your thread of course mortgages is driven not just by traffic growth but by prominence on our site and awareness among our home shoppers that they can get a mortgage -- a purchase mortgage from Trulia or Zillow answer we have yet another kicker, yet another lever in our mortgages business which assuming raising awareness among our existing users about our mortgages product and that's one of the reasons why mortgages revenue historically has grown even faster than traffic or premier agent leads.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Peck with SunTrust. Your questions please.
Robert Peck: Just want to clarify with comments in the last question there. As we think about 2017 and more of a normalized growth you stated that lead should grow greater than user growth which I believe is within the midteens this quarter, 15%, 16% so as we think about the revenue per leads and in the growth of leads to drop premier agent revenue 2017, how should we think about -- is that something that shaking out to around 20% or what are the puts and takes we should consider as we think about normalized growth in premier agent revenue for 2017? Thanks.
Spencer Rascoff: Well, remember there are a couple of different metrics here all sort of working in concert there's unique user growth, there's lead growth and then there's premier agent revenue growth which drops out the bottom and between those two there's effectively and implied cost per lead which we don't sell on a cost per lead basis, we sell on an cost per impression basis but if you're trying to model that premier agent revenue funnel you have to think about cost per lead in between the lead volume and premier agent revenue. What we try to do for investors to provide visibility on all this is give revenue guidance on the premier agent line item in total because there are a lot of moving pieces and I realize it's hard from the outside looking in to understand how these different metrics work in tandem with one another. As Kathleen mentioned we are still working on determining what the right metrics are going into 2017 as we phase out advertiser count and average revenue per advertiser which we think are not great metrics and aren't really indicative of understanding the business results. So look for more visibility on that in next quarter's call.
Robert Peck: Thank you.
Spencer Rascoff: I think we will do one or two from Twitter now. So Niel [indiscernible] asks what are efforts to improve lead conversion for agents and are there promising product changes with respect to lead conversion So this is obviously a significant area of focus of ours even back to the last question where I was just discussing the impact of lead growth and its impact on premier agent revenue implied there is a lead conversion rate so what portion of these leads that actually become commission [indiscernible] we want that to be as high as possible to drive greater purchase of premier agent impressions. So the first and probably most successful thing that we've done to improve lead conversion has been to reduce the number of premier agent advertisers and this is something that has been ongoing over the last two years were we've been focusing on up leveling our premier agents and by extension up leveling the real estate industry overall focusing on great agents and as I mentioned great agents are gaining share from hobbyists obvious and Zillow Group is a big contributor to that. So getting more of our leads in the hands of agents that already perform high lead conversion is the single best thing we can do to improve our lead conversion. The other significant initiative has been the around the improvements to our premier agent app and in that regard we announced last week at our Premier Agent Summit in Las Vegas to 1500 advertisers some significant improvements to our premier agent app including ingestion of leads from third-party websites so no longer is premier as an app just a great way to manage our Trulia or Zillow leads it's also a great way to manage leads from other sources. That has the benefit of turning the premier agent app into a much more full-featured CRM and to the extent that agents use that more often than they're going to do a better job converting the Trulia and Zillow leads that reside in the premier agent app. In 2017 we will be doing a tighter integration of Dollop, instant premier agent app that also will improve efficiency and improve lead conversion and then finally I'll just mention training and local events including last week's events were example in Las Vegas which those are great sessions which impact lead conversion as we run clinics on lead conversion and agents train one another on how to make the most of their Zillow Group app advertising and all of that drives into lead conversion.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your questions please.
Ron Josey: Spencer I wanted to maybe circle back on Mark's question earlier on self-service and another one on the premier agent losses so in self-service understanding uncertainty I was just wondering if it's fair to compare it all this model chains that you're seeing that we've seen in the quarter of the country any comparison to when you all switch from share voice to impressions I think was in 4Q '12 and then from a 2K it looks like there's about 2000 premier agents that were turned off this quarter and that’s different from the stabilizing trends you seen recently I know you said Kathleen was an expected decline but others certain agents that are getting priced out by a higher producing agents which I guess Spencer you just said but specifically I point to accelerating growth a number of agent spending 5000 or more that was pretty interesting but is there anything else going on that’s driving that higher churn? Thanks.
Spencer Rascoff: On what's driving the -- I'm trying to answer the second one first. I would say the biggest change has been increasing teams, buying impressions which has the -- creates the appearance of fewer advertisers because a single agent is supporting multiple advertisers. Yet another reason why we don't love advertiser count as a metrics because it can be a little bit misleading in that regard. You said something that I would push back on a little bit you said some types of agents getting priced out that's not really how I would describe it. It's more a matter of hobbyists who were part-time real estate agent spending on a couple hundred dollars a month with us those agents that just don’t -- if you are still spending a couple hundred dollars a month over the last couple of years you're probably not converting our leads at a high rate because if you were you would be sending a couple thousand dollars a month by now due to reinvested those earnings back into the ad product and so we been systematically taking those impressions back and selling them to agents who spend more and have higher lead conversions. In terms of trying to compare our switch to the self-serve ad product as compared with the switch from share voice to fix price, I would say that in terms of complexity and just difference it's pretty comparable but I would say that we've done this change much more slowly therefore, I feel personally that there is less risk associated with what remains in front of us as compared with when we -- a couple years mad the switch from share [indiscernible] to fixed price. So it's similar in terms of the amount of change but we're already through a lot of the risk -- not all the risk that a lot of the risk from having spent so much time testing this over the course of 2016.
Ron Josey: Any potential metrics you could share like that give you that certainty and I will go back in the queue after that.
Spencer Rascoff: We looked at hundreds of them on the agents that we migrated or in the regions that we migrated so, upsell percentage, churn, agent retention, purchase levels by cohort, CPM over -- CPM by [indiscernible]. We’re looking at these things and we have made changes along the way as we’ve been rolling this out as I say to about a quarter of the country now. I don't think we're sharing any of the answers to those metrics but we have been looking at a lot of them along the way. The next question is from Twitter asks somebody asks [indiscernible] on rentals and traffic and leads and whether you’re taking share from Craigslist in certain markets? I would say that at our multi-family forum a couple of weeks ago where we had a couple hundred clients from the apartment rental industry there was a lot of discussion about craigslist but only into the extent that multifamily executives were basically agreeing with one another that its days are numbered that there seems to be a growing consensus in the part of the multifamily industry that there is now sufficient renter market share on Zillow Group's brands and others online brands such that the network effect that Craigslist has always had is eroding. I heard that consistently from our multifamily partners. So very hard to get data on that but I talked with lots of building or lots of property managers to say they are just not posting to Craigslist anymore because they can get enough leads from Zillow Group and others.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your questions please.
Heath Terry: Spencer I was hoping you could give us an update on the tests around dynamic pricing and how you're thinking about continued rollout of that into additional markets or even more broadly across the platform and then to the extent that you are looking at sort of other ways to monetize whether or not we should expect sort of any return to sponsor results in the search sort or some other way to monetize the premium placement there.
Spencer Rascoff: Sure. So the first question around dynamic pricing is essentially what we discussed around the self-serve ad product which just gives the agents more control and more visibility into their ad spend. We are through about a quarter of a country we will finish the next three quarters by the end of the year and I'm feeling good but there's always risk of course when you roll something out like that. \ In terms of other forms of monetization in the agent business the big new one is what we launched last week really two things that we launched last week one is seller boost which finally monetizes the sell side of the marketplace, the listing side which is of course half of the commission TAM [ph] and allows premier agent to buy listing leads or leads from sellers from Trulia and Zillow. We bundled that with the premier agent business as an upsell. We started selling its last week at our premier agent forum in Las Vegas it was very well received and it's extremely early it's been less than a week of course but we're optimistic about it and certainly there is a lot of demand from our premier agents to acquire listing leads not just buyer leads historically the premier agent product as mostly about acquiring buyer leads and then the other product announcement that we launched last week was Premier Agent Direct which is the Facebook precision targeting which is also very well-received in Las Vegas at our Premier Agent Forum again it's only been a week of selling. So I'm optimistic but it's too early to say.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your questions please
Unidentified Analyst: This is Kevin on for Brian. Two if possible, first on the self-serve interface, can you take [indiscernible] could you talk a little bit more about initial learnings from self-serve and maybe a little bit about the gross trajectory of ad spend from self-serve agents and then you mentioned as well that you are baking in some uncertainty in regards to the premier agent revenue. How much cushion have you incorporated and it seems kind of incremental margins in a 4Q guys been lower-than-expected. Would you elaborate on that a little more?
Spencer Rascoff: Sure. The goal of the switch on the premier agent ad product was to provide premier agents with more control and flexibility to have the marketplace determine the CPM rather than Zillow Group determine the CPM and to give more functionality to the agents so they could literally self-serve their advertising if they chose to. They can still of course apply through our phone sales teams as well but they also have the flexibility to do it themselves. So what we learned along the way of course informed the final rollout of the first quarter and now inform the roll out to the next three quarters and we learned a lot along the way obviously for competitive reasons we're not going to get into too much detail about how we changed it along the way but suffice it to say we feel like we've maintained the benefits of the fixed price model wherein agents were buying a fixed number of impressions over a period of time while still improving some of the challenges to that model including the fact that that model ends up with sold-out impressions and zip codes from time to time and it requires us to proactively call agents to increase their price in order to increase CPM. We think we've kept the best of the old model and we think we've introduced some benefits to the new model. I guess the second part of your question is to try to quantify or conceptualize the level of conservatism on the Q4 guide with respect to the remainder of his rollout, it's hard to say it's really hard to do that there a lot of moving pieces here including the introduction of two brand-new ad products, Seller Boost and Premier Agent Direct. There's been a lot of focus in the Q&A so far on Q4 and the impact of the change in the premier agent model and how it impacts Q4. The reason that we are making this change to self-serve model is we are very confident that that positions us much better for the medium and long term where eventually the $10 plus billion dollars of real estate advertising will move online and we believe it will move to the sites that has the largest audience share which is of course us and we think that this self-serve dynamic pricing model positions us much better to capture the lion share of that budget as it moves online. What will happen in Q4 we will of course have to see but frankly I'm much more focused on making sure that we are well-positioned for the billions of dollars of real estate ad spend which we will surely migrate onto the internet onto the next couple of years and making sure that we have the right ad model to capture the lion share of that. There's a question on twitter from [indiscernible] that asks what was the organic revenue growth rate? So we don't historically breakout M&A from revenue but obviously with the exception of Trulia I don't think -- we haven't really driven growth rates -- revenue growth rate through M&A with the exception of the Trulia acquisition. Dollop was the largest revenue acquisition and it wasn't significant to the total revenue of course it's very significant strategically. The second part of this question asks as lead flow towards traffic growth is that an appropriate proxy for premier agent revenue growth? And I would say no it's not because of the discussion about cost per lead that I mentioned it again, one of the reasons that we are switching the premier agent at product to the self-serve model and with dynamic pricing is to position us such that once the whole country is moved over to this new pricing model the prices will float as demand increases.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Graham with Canaccord. Your questions please
Michael Graham: Does the self-serve model change margin structure at all like your sales commissions the same to your sales force there. And then Spencer, on the last call you gave really interesting metric which is that I don't know if you could call it a metric but an idea that you would want to keep expanding the sum of revenue growth plus EBITDA margin over time and you did that nicely this quarter it was 34 in Q2, 53 in Q3 your guidance for Q4 imply something like 57. Can we still kind of think about that as a framework to work with as we think about the next year or two?
Spencer Rascoff: So the first question on self-serve and sort of commissions and selling expense, the answer is I think that the self-serve model does allow was to service more revenue per salesperson headcount than the older model but it's by no means a reduction in the size of our current sales force. So it might mean we need to grow it less quickly than we otherwise would but it's not going to result in a smaller sales team that we currently have. You're right last call I introduced this concept of revenue growth plus EBITDA margin so let me just describe my thoughts around 2017 revenue and EBITDA margin. Firstly, we have not completed our 2017 planning process yet so it's a little premature -- it's very premature for me to speculate on what revenue growth or EBITDA might be for next year but that having been said we are a growth company, revenue growing run 30% year-over-year and we look at these two dials revenue growth and margin and we evaluate trade-offs between the two of them. When we do that we take a very long-term orientation which means we make investments that pay off in terms of revenue expansion and market expansion down the road. So I will give you three quick examples here. We spent a lot of money advertising to increase our audience leadership which suppresses near-term margin but of course we think create long-term value by expanding our audience leadership. We also build-out emerging marketplaces which again, suppresses near-term margin when we make investments in things like rentals and mortgages in New York City but we think create long-term revenue expansion and margin expansion. Number three, software tools for our real estate agent which clearly suppresses near-term margin the level of investment that we're making in premier agent app and a Dollop suppresses near-term margin but we think sows the seeds for greater revenue growth down the road in [indiscernible] down the road. So in that trade-off between revenue and margin we have a bias towards revenue growth and long-term value creation at the expense of near-term margin maximization. So we aim for revenue growth along with steady margin expansion year-over-year. This quarter's 26% margin I would describe as somewhat aberrational due to a significant revenue beat and cost efficiencies so the Q3 guide was a 23% EBITDA margin and we delivered 26% EBITDA margin, it's an extra 300 basis points of margin for about half revenue and half expense savings and so that's where the 26 came from. So anyway hopefully that explains how we're thinking about 2017 and how we think about the trade-off between revenue growth and margin expansion.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Your questions please
Aaron Kessler: A couple questions just first on the [indiscernible], first product really addressing the sellers side which is a big market in itself do you think we will see numerous products addressing this? Are you kind of given this product a while and see how it does. On OpEx guide for Q4 it looks like a step up of may be in the $8 million to $10 million range roughly sequentially, any specific OpEx line we should expect that increase in? Thank you.
Spencer Rascoff: I will take the first portion Aaron and then Kathleen will take the second one of Q4 OpEx. So on the seller product you're right this is our first real foray into the sell side, Trulia had a small business call Trulia Seller ads which is sort of spun out of its acquisition of house values and market leader and Zillow of course inherited that with the creation of Zillow Group but seller boost and connecting it with Zillow Seller Leads and selling it the full force of our whole sales team across our entire base of premier agent integrated with our core premier agent business this is the first time we've ever done anything like that on the sell side. As I’ve said it's been less than a week so in terms of will we iterate and innovate on that or buildout other seller ad products or both it's too early to say but we've certainly had an intense level of interest on the part of premier agents and frankly on the part of investor shareholders over the last couple of years about the creation of something that monetizes the sell side of the marketplace and so I'm excited to have a product out there now and certainly the perception last week was very good. There's definitely demand from agents to acquire listings typically they will pay significantly more for a good listings lead them they will pay for a higher lead and so I'm excited about the potential for this product. Kathleen, Q4 OpEx?
Kathleen Philips: Sure. So for Q4 of OpEx what we are seeing is a little bit of an acceleration of some of the investments we actually had hope to make in Q3 that we've delivered the results we did in Q3 in part because some of the investments in the business primarily around people and product were just happening a little more slowly than we expected so some of that will come to pass in Q4. That's really the bulk of the difference there. Other than our usual focus as Spencer just mentioned on long-term investments in product there's nothing unusual about Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your questions please.
Lloyd Walmsley: You guys talked about baking in some conservatism into the PA revenue guidance and the model transition but it looks like at least at the high end there's not much to acceleration in that growth rate so curious if you can just give us a sense of where you are anticipating the most strength? Are you seeing a big uptick in broker connect or premier agent direct. I would be curious to get a sense there. And that I guess second question would just be as you rollout this new model is there any change in how you recognize revenue that could impact seasonality at all and then similarly just curious if you can give us a sense for how you recognize revenue on this new premier agent direct business. Is that recognize gross and is like tact to Facebook, any color you can share on that stuff would be really helpful. Thanks.
Kathleen Philips: Sure. So on the Facebook piece it will be a gross revenue recognition and in terms of any change for revenue recognition for the core premier agent product it will be just the same so you shouldn’t expect that to be impacted by seasonality or by the self-serve model itself.
Spencer Rascoff: And on the just Q4 revenue you are right to point out Lloyd that there really are a lot of things happening in Q4. There's the core premier agent business the switch from fixed price which we have the last couple of years to this new self-serve model but then there are four new add products in the market on the premier agent business there's seller boost, on the premier agent business there is premier agent direct which is the Facebook with our precision targeting, on the premier agent business there is premier broker and on the rental business there's this new multifamily direct ad product for apartment buildings we’re buying for advertising on Facebook using our targeting. So we have four new ad products and a switch to our core selling model for our premier agent business. So there are a lot of moving pieces in Q4 and of course you take all together that's one of the reasons that there's some conservatism as we look to what the results might be in Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephen Inc. Your questions please
John Campbell: Just curious about the pace of growth within the other real estate line, I mean that's been a bit of a kind of cloudy revenue stream for us. I know you’ve got a mix of acquired rev and then you've got some pretty quick organic growth engines in there. So just curious maybe just brought expectations over the near to medium term and then if you could maybe just touch on the seasonality in that business once it gets a little bit more mature?
Kathleen Philips: Yes, so it's Kathleen and as we said in the prepared remarks we've been experiencing really strong growth in a number of those marketplaces. This is the first Q4 that you are going to see Dollop on [indiscernible] so that's reflected a little bit there. The seasonality should really track seasonality of the rest of our business at this point because the bulk of that revenue is coming from rentals and New York City. So naturally it's going to while pretty much like the regular real estate market. I think you can expect that will track the rest of our business pretty closely. We're super excited about each of these products but at this point we don't have specific comments to make particularly along agent services and bridge.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kerry Rice with Needham. Your questions please.
Kerry Rice: Maybe back to self-serve one last time. Can you talk about at all the adoption with that 25% of the nation rollout just in general or maybe some color around the agent profile that you found most likely to use that self-service. And then on more a financial question on EBITDA and maybe opportunities for leverage going forward without guiding 2017, but as you guys are clearly the largest player in the market you spend a fairly big amount on direct advertising. You see an opportunity to pull back maybe on TV advertising. I know that does a lot for awareness but as you have a strong brand you look at shifting some of that maybe to more channels which would improve the leverage in the model. Thank you.
Spencer Rascoff: So, the types of advertisers that seem to do the best in the self-serve product are those that have the highest lead conversion no surprise, same as it ever was. Those that convert leads at the highest rates can most profitably acquire new leads by buying impressions. I'm not sure it's that big a change from the old model but it does sort of throw little more fuel on the fire and it helps solidify our strategic focus on those better agents who are gaining share at the expensive lobbyists. The trade-off between online and offline advertising is something that we're always looking at. We control those two levers centrally if you will, so when I sit down every month to look at the efficacy of our advertising by brand and at the Zillow Group level everything is on the table and we look at measurements on a cost per awareness point and on a cost per lead basis and on all sorts of different metrics looking at offline and online side by side, I think unlike many other brands that had to sort of silo a TV budget up to the side and sort of that is what it is and then they dial up and down the online budget, we already to our media planning in an integrated manner which I think is the right way to do it. I already believe that our measurement of our off-line spend is best in class certainly best in category but likely best in class. So as we look to our 2017 ad expense we will determine what we want the target model to be target margin for 2017 and determine what types of headcount growth we need to support our revenue ambition next year and of course what type of ad expense that margin will -- and then we make the decision on offline versus online throughout the course of the year as well as by brand throughout the course of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Your questions please.
Mark May: I had two if I could, one might be a little long but back on the self-serve platform. It seems pretty significant including in terms of how agents will be interacting now with Zillow just a couple of questions around that. Do you expect pretty much most all of you are premier agents will be bidding directly on this platform or will there be some sort of a hybrid model where some of them you and some of them continue to work through a salesperson and then just on the bidding process itself what type of measurement and analytics are you providing will agents be able to see things like the number of impressions that they are receiving and the number of leads that they are getting within this platform. And then if I could a follow-up on the Premier Agent Direct Program.
Spencer Rascoff: Sure. So the answer is they have enormous visibility into their ad spend and enormous flexibility with their ad spend so they can see on a map, how many impressions are available in each of the areas they're interested in, how many likely leads are available, what the cost per impression is, what the cost per lead is, what their potential ROI is if they are advertising that zipcode etcetera and so far our agents love that type of visibility. In terms of how many of them will do it themselves versus rely on a Zillow Group employee over the phone it's hard to know. We are sort of indifferent to some extent I mean we want the advertiser to be served however they want to be served so if they want to do it themselves that's great and if they want to do it over the phone with one of us that's fine too and we want the product to work in either case. Mark what was your second area?
Mark May: It was Facebook.
Spencer Rascoff: Well just follow up with us if you would like Mark.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Tom White with Macquarie. Your questions please.
Tom White: Just the primary broker program can you just talk a little bit about that the economics of those relationships and the ARPA profile and just kind of curious reconciling that with your focus on sort of empowering the super agents or independence kind of are those two focuses at odds at all and then just on the display business it looks like it kind of beat [ph] a little bit of Q3 and are you dying for a little bit of an uplift just an update there. Thanks.
Kathleen Philips: The display business as you know we have been strategically focused on having the display business decline, that being said the areas in which we are prioritizing for display are doing really well so we did have a modest beat their and that team does a really terrific job in maximizing the opportunities that we want to see for display while at the same time understanding that our strategic shift has shifted away from that.
Spencer Rascoff: On premier broker, this is really an extension of the premier agent business. What we have done is we've allowed brokers to buy impressions, they create a broker profile page, they indicate which agents roll up to their brokerage and the broker buys impressions in whatever zip they'd like come around the city. They generate leads and those leads get passed through to their agents and then when those agents close those deals they pay referral fee to the broker for having provided the capital to source the lead. That referral fee is separate and distinct from the split that's they pay to the broker for all their transactions. And what this does is allows the broker to re-margin their business, it provides us with another sales channel that has capital, has training, it has captive agents that are there ready and able to work leads and then we provide the lead volume and the accountability and the tracking and the software to the broker so they can actually see where the leads go. The ARPA is very high. In fact, where this came from was from a number of our top spending existing premier agents -- the team leads some of them are already are brokers and so what we've done is we've formalized this product and customized it to be more replicable across the country to brokerages and then I think I said it in the prepared remarks it has the advantage of providing additional advertiser liquidity by injecting broker capital into the mix. It's off to a good start and again, we will see. Okay so, I think we will double check on Twitter if there are still some questions we will take them online. With that thanks everyone for joining the call today. Have a great fall season and we will talk to you with an update on our progress in February. Thanks everybody.
Kathleen Philips: Bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day."
