"Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2021 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  Please also note, this event is being recorded At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Steve Swett, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Steve Swett: Thank you. Aloha and welcome to our call to discuss Alexander & Baldwin's second quarter 2021 earnings. With me today for our presentation are A&B's President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Benjamin; and Brett Brown, Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by Lance Parker, A&B's Chief Real Estate Officer; Clayton Chun, Chief Accounting Officer, who are available for the Q&A portion of the call.
Chris Benjamin: Thanks Steve, and good afternoon to our listeners. Our second quarter results were strong, building on the momentum we experienced last quarter. Our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform very well as Hawaii's economy improves, fueled by a remarkable resurgence of tourism. There also has been a tremendous surge in demand for Hawaii real estate, which has supported our monetization efforts. The company took in approximately $44 million of total net cash from operating and investing activities in the quarter, primarily from the success of our land sales program and the strength of our commercial real estate portfolio. This influx of cash allowed us to hit an important milestone in the second quarter, reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 5.4 times. For the first time since the 2018, special distribution associated with our REIT conversion, we are within our targeted leverage range of five to six times, and we expect further improvement in delevering as our monetization efforts advance in the coming quarters. This progress not only shrinks our noncommercial real estate asset base, but supports a pivot back to growing our portfolio through acquisitions. We're in the early stages of building a pipeline and are pleased to be in a position once again to have dry powder for pursuit of growth. Another sign of our strengthening performance and outlook is our Board's decision to increase our quarterly dividend $0.02 or 12.5%, following a $0.01 increase last quarter. At $0.18 per share, our dividend is now just $0.01 below pre-COVID levels. I'm proud of our team and pleased by Hawaii's and A&B's exceptional progress year-to-date, and I have growing optimism for the balance of the year. Let me provide some additional color on the Hawaii economy and the recovery, we're experiencing. The state's employment trends are improving rapidly. Year-to-date through May, the rate of employment growth in Hawaii is nearly double the national average and the unemployment rate fell more than 2% in the first five months of the year. Tourism is accelerating, thanks to a vaccine exemption for mainland travelers, that was instituted in early July. Inbound passenger levels for June were at 82% of 2019 levels even with essentially no international travelers and before the vaccine exemption was implemented for the mainland travelers. These are great signs for further growth to come. While our portfolio is not heavily dependent on direct tourist spend, tourism does drive the overall health of the economy, which in turn has supported a dramatic increase in spending at our neighborhood shopping centers. Our two resort retail centers, which comprised just 8% of our portfolio's pre-COVID net operating income or NOI, also are bouncing back nicely.
Brett Brown: Thank you, Chris and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with our financial results for the second quarter. We recorded net income of $12.8 million or $0.18 per share, compared to a net loss of $4.7 million or negative $0.07 per share in the same quarter of 2020. Second quarter funds from operations was $22.3 million or $0.31 per share, compared to $5.9 million or $0.08 per share in the same quarter of the prior year. Core FFO was $18.5 million or $0.25 per share, compared with $13.1 million or $0.18 per share respectively in the same quarter of the prior year. Growth in core FFO over the past 12 months was due to improved tenant performance resulting in higher current rent payments and increased collections of previously reserved amounts.
Chris Benjamin: Thanks, Brett. With the accelerating recovery of Hawaii and the return of meaningful levels of tourism, our portfolio is approaching pre-pandemic levels of performance. We continue to focus on selling non-core assets and our progress this quarter reflects both our level of emphasis on this effort and the strength of buyer demand for Hawaii real estate. Our balance sheet is in great shape, highlighting the success of our simplification efforts and supporting our pivot toward a focus on commercial real estate portfolio growth. We believe success in both these efforts will result in meaningful value creation to A&B shareholders in a much simpler business model, with every passing quarter. With that, we'll now open the call for your questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session.  And our first question today comes from Marla Backer from Sidoti. Please go ahead with your question. Marla, is it possible, your phone is on mute. 
Christ Benjamin: Operator, are you still there?
Operator: I am still here, sir. Marla, is it possible, your phone is on mute. And we'll go to our next question, Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question
Alexander Goldfarb: Hi, good -- I donâ€™t even know what -- it's been a crazy earnings day. So, on the improvement this quarter versus last, I mean obviously it's pretty tremendous. The earnings beat was strong. You guys went down the laundry list. Economic growth in Hawaii is great. Land sales are healthy. Leasing sounds strong. Sounds like things are progressing on Grace. On the capital side, just a little curious on that front. You said that you want to establish an ATM recasting line of credit. That's normal course. But then, you said that you have no plans to issue, but you want to be in a position. So, given that the appetite on the island, as far you should take the opportunity on the island to acquire is, it takes a long time as you guys have shown us. Getting all this capital in place, is that foretelling that, there's a lot of transaction opportunity that's going to come about, or is this merely so that on your kitchen cupboard or on the kitchen counter that you have all these options, it doesn't mean necessarily that you're seeing a commensurate amount of investment opportunity that we should expect?
Chris Benjamin: Yes. It's a great question, Alex. I'll start. This is Chris and then Brett can chime in with anything else he wants to add. I think really the way to think about this is that, we -- although we have been a REIT for 3.5 years now or I guess technically 1/1/2017, so I guess that's 4.5 years, we've obviously not been trading like a REIT. We've had a lot of overhang from our non-core assets. And so we haven't been trading at or near our NAV. We've had some headwinds that we've been dealing with. And because of that, we haven't necessarily had the -- been in a position to use some of the tools that a REIT would traditionally use to finance acquisitions, whether that's used -- doing an UPREIT transaction or issuing equity. As we get closer to simplification and we get rid of a lot of our non-core assets, we believe that we will be acting and trading much more like a REIT and we'll be much better positioned to use the traditional tools that a REIT uses. And so, what this is really about is, putting those tools in place. And so I would say it's more the latter of what you -- of your two options. Having said that, we are pivoting back, both on the strength of the simplification and the stronger balance sheet. We are pivoting back towards a growth orientation. And so, all the more reason to have these tools available. But I would say, it's really more a matter of just making sure that we've got the arrows in our quiver, than it is a belief that we have an imminent need, partly because we expect to continue generating good amounts of cash in the coming quarters and that would be our -- of course, our first preference would be to invest that cash into commercial real estate, as we get it from additional monetization proceeds. Anything you want to add, Brett? 
Brett Brown: No, I think you covered it very well. And again, to reiterate Chris' statement, it's really putting the tools in place, having them available for when we do get to a point where we would need that. It's really getting the credit facilities in line with our dedicated REIT peers and then, just having those optionalities when we -- when and if we need those.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, a topic in the weeds and hopefully you don't mind. Looking at your same-store breakout by sector, you obviously can appreciate why retail would be up 43%, industrial really strong. I'm a little curious as to why the ground lease business would have grown 9.5%. I would think that ground leases are pretty stable, sort of, a 1% to 2%, or 2% to 3% grower, year-in, year-out. And I don't recall you guys having, like, been stiffed on any ground lease rent in the past year or something that would have caused that to surge. So why would ground lease and same-store NOI grow 9.5% year-over-year?
Lance Parker: Hey. Alex, its Lance. I think your comment is fair in terms of what you might expect on a traditional annual growth rate. Although, as we've talked about, one of the beauties of our ground lease portfolio is, we do get these mark-to-market or sometimes fixed increases that would drive outsized growth. And so, specific to what you're seeing in the supplement, we did have two ground leases this year that did reset. One was HART which is our 36 acres over in Kapolei, as well as a shopping center in urban Honolulu, Kaimuki Shopping Center. And so, we've received the benefit of both of those and that's reflected in the numbers.
Alexander Goldfarb: And is that -- Lance, is that typical? Like, we could -- is this something that -- are these just two unique assets, or this is something that's embedded in your portfolio and this is something that over time we will see increases like this?
Lance Parker: Yes. It's really the latter. And I know it's a little difficult to project a run rate of the opportunities. But we do try to illuminate, at least, the fixed steps in our supplement in our ground lease table. And then, we also highlight, when we do have these opportunities to step to fair market value. And we provided comps in the past in some of the significant increases that we've been able to get to NOI. And then, of course, the ultimate opportunity within the ground lease portfolio is the reversion of the leasehold improvements at the end of the term, either near it when we can buy it at a discount or at the absolute end of the term when we get it back for free.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, great. Lance, thank you.
Chris Benjamin: Thank you, Alex.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marla Backer from Sidoti.
Marla Backer: Hey. Can you hear me now?
Chris Benjamin: We can hear you now, Marla.
Brett Brown: Yes, Marla.
Marla Backer: Okay, great. So as you get closer to resumed growth, can you give us any sense of what you think the timeline is between identifying potential assets for acquisition and moving through the process to eventually completing an addition ?
Lance Parker: Hi, Marla, this is Lance. Let me try to provide some color on just the current state of the investment market here in Hawaii. I will say that over the past 18 months, there's been few investment trades and even fewer marketed opportunities. Now, with that said, one of our competitive advantages is our ability to source off-market deals, given the fact that we're here locally and that we have the relationships. But it does take some time, to your point, to build that pipeline. And as Chris indicated in his remarks, given the progress we've made on simplification, as well as our strengthening outlook of the market, we have tasked our investment team in really focusing on building that pipeline. Now, it may take a little bit of time for us to find the right deals, but we are excited and committed to becoming acquisitive again. And then, I would just also add that, in addition to external growth opportunities, we continue to pursue internal growth opportunities within the existing portfolio. So whether it's seeking build-to-suits at Maui Business Park or some current evaluations that are ongoing for repositioning within our retail portfolio, we'll continue to pursue those opportunities as well.
Marla Backer: Okay. Great. Thanks. And so I gather from your answer that you've already identified certain assets that might be appropriately position us?
Lance Parker: We have.
Marla Backer: Okay. And then, in terms of the strength that you've seen with demand for loan sales increasing, has there been any variability in that demand that you've seen subsequent to the close of the quarter, or has demand maintained its strength?
Lance Parker: You were breaking up a little bit Marla, but I think you're asking whether we've seen a change in the market, just, in the last month or two since the -- or the last month since the quarter closed. Is that right?
Marla Backer: Yes.
Lance Parker: Yes. No, I think, if anything, we're seeing sustained and robust demand. And this is both at, what I would call, the retail level, which is, selling individual lots, for example, at a project like Kukui'ula or at the builder parcel level, where you would sell a parcel to a third-party to develop homes and then for the industrial users in Maui Business Park. I think we're seeing good sustained demand. And just in general, the real estate market in Hawaii has been very hot this year. And I don't think we see any signs of that subsiding.
Marla Backer: Okay. Thank you very much.
Chris Benjamin: Thank you, Marla.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Good afternoon. I apologize if I missed some of this. But the big revision to the same-store NOI on the positive side, I understand, is from reversal of some deferrals. But were there any other changes like occupancy assumptions or leasing spreads that might have also impacted the guidance higher?
Lance Parker: It's mostly on those reversals. We also expect, on the range, it's going to be the inclusion of lower reversals that we -- or, excuse me, lower reserves that we would expect on a go-forward basis, as well as just the improvements, correct, is what we've seen this year so far with greater tenant demand.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. And then, with regard to Kukui'ula the volume has picked up again and you had another distribution. Chris, does this -- are you still committed to seeking a partner or exit from this, or does the acceleration of the sales make it an alternative to just hold the asset longer term?
Chris Benjamin: No. We're still committed to pursuing monetization of the asset. We feel rather than this being a sign that we should hold the project, we feel it's a great opportunity actually to monetize it. And so we are still seeking that path because of the benefits it would have towards our simplification and just cleaning up our story.
Sheila McGrath: And with regards to the simplification both, with Grace Pacific and Kukui'ula are there formal processes that are already going -- ongoing for both of those, or is it still just a plan?
Chris Benjamin: I would describe it as active, but not terribly formal.
Sheila McGrath: Okay.
Chris Benjamin: That's about the best I can do. Rest assured that we're very actively looking at our opportunities, but haven't done a broad public marketing process on either.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. And then you did mention moving the team in the past few months more to look at growth in acquisition. Maybe Lance or somebody could just touch on, how that process is going. Is there anything in the pipeline at this juncture?
Lance Parker: Hi Sheila, it's Lance. I did make some comments earlier about the pivot of the investments group and looking at opportunities in the market. I would say that, general market conditions are still relatively tight. We are starting to see some slowing in opportunities. And as is typically the case, most of what we're seeing, are off-market opportunities given our relationships and the investment team's efforts. So with all of that said I would expect probably maybe some modest investment opportunities for us this year. And then, increasing the pipeline for larger acquisitions as hopefully market conditions continue to improve into 2022.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. And last question for me on, Aikahi shopping center. The yield on cost looks like very attractive. Just in terms of us modeling that, when do you expect that asset to start contributing to NOI?
Lance Parker: So we're already getting some contributions this year with the commencement of the lease and the opening of Starbucks which was a couple of months early. We've also turned on rent for one of our large relocations which is the veterinary clinic that moved over to the dormant theater space. And then we've also received the benefit of the increase in rent from Safeway, since we completed the majority of the improvements, for their area of the shopping center. So those would be all partial year benefits. And then, we expect obviously full year benefits of those in 2022 as well as some of the rent commencements that we expect to occur from some of the in-line leasing activity that's going on right now.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. Thank you.
Chris Benjamin: Thanks, Sheila.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to, Mr. Swett for any closing remarks.
Steve Swett: Yes. Thank you for your time today, on the call. And feel free to reach out with any questions. Aloha. And have a great day.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."
