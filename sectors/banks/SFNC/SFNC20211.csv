"Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Simmons First National Corporation First Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. At this time, all participant are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Steve Massanelli. Please go ahead.
Steve Massanelli: Good morning and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. My name is Steve Massanelli, and I serve as Chief Administrative Officer at Simmons First National Corporation. Joining me today are George Makris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Fehlman, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer; and David Garner, Executive Director of Finance and Accounting and Chief Accounting Officer; and Matt Reddin, Chief Banking Officer.
George Makris: Thanks Steve and welcome once again to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. In our press release we reported net income of $67 million for the first quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share were $0.62 for the quarter. Included in the first quarter earnings was net income of $3.4 million related to a gain on the sale of our branches in Illinois and merger related in net branch right sizing expenses. Excluding the impact on these items the company's core earnings were $64 million for the first quarter and diluted earnings per share were $0.59 per share. Our return on average assets was 1.2%. Our return on average common equity was 9.2%. Our return on tangible common equity was 15.9% and our efficiency ratio was 57.8% for the first quarter.
Operator:  Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Stephen Scouten: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks guys.
George Makris: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Scouten: I'm just kind of curious, I guess if you could talk a little bit more about the ideology around the securities investments and kind of how you're thinking about that in an environment where rates have begun to increase and move higher here lately.
Bob Fehlman: Yes Stephen, this is Bob. I will start off and as we said at the end of the Q4 in our release then we planned to invest about a billion or so and get it close to the $5 billion and we did this quarter. And as we did you can still see our liquidity is still we've got cash of $3.9 billion. Right now we're probably what we would call fully invested in the security portfolio. We will continue to look for opportunities when events come up for sales like this quarter. Just an example we had $38 million in sales and it resulted in a $4.8 million gain it's hard not to pass on a four years worth of interest at one time. So we took advantage of that but we'll continue to manage at this level. The 10 years been hovering at that 155 to 165. We'll continue to look at it as we go forward. We will probably, you may see securities go up in the next quarter but that really is more defensive mechanism that we put some short-term very liquid securities in that probably is about a 15 basis point pickup on the cash overnight money and really it would be to park it into the security portfolio. So if you do see it going up it should improve the duration on the portfolio and it would really be holding the money there in the interim period.
Stephen Scouten: Got it. Okay. Helpful. And then maybe if I could ask a question around the loan growth I know you guys noted the $1.2 billion pipeline build which looks very similar to what it was coming out of 1Q ‘20 but obviously then we had a very different environment. So I'm just kind of wondering in the near term how you think that could translate into kind of bottom line net growth ex-PPP and then the seasonality around the credit card portfolio that seemed maybe larger than it was in the past and I was wondering if there was anything unusual there?
Matt Reddin: Stephen, this is Matt. I'll tackle that one first. A couple of things that let me talk first about the headwinds and then I'll talk about the pipeline. You made a really good comment on the credit card. That's seasonal and natural normally but with the stimulus money that has come in that is more than we ever could expected it's down even further at $175 million but as we talked about in Q4 we also have seasonality in our aggregate portfolio that's another $40 million and then you have our mortgage warehouse which had a tremendous year last year still doing well but that's another significant pay down and then we also knew we talked about our planned exit of energy.
Stephen Scouten: Yes man, that's super helpful and I guess you guys did note kind of mid single digit growth in the back half of ‘21. So is it fair to say we could see another little bit of decline based on your expectations in the second quarter here or do you think this might have been the last quarter of outright decline from the loan book?
Matt Reddin: That's a really good question. I would tell you until stimulus 2 came, yes Q1 would have been the low water mark but now with this a new amount of stimulus that's in the market I'll give you an example. I had a conversation with one of our great clients last week that has about a $5 million just owner occupied real estate, great business and he explained to me on our lunch that through all the cash that he has to stimulus it's paid off now. He went ahead and just paid that off. So those are the unknowns that we did not anticipate coming in the Q or into 2021. So I believe we could have hit the low water mark but it could trail a little bit further but like we've said feel really good about the back half of the year returning to a normal growth rate.
Stephen Scouten: Okay, great. That is super helpful. Thanks guys for the time. Appreciate it.
George Makris: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of David Feaster with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Feaster: Hey, good morning everybody.
George Makris: Good morning David.
David Feaster: I just wanted to kind of follow up on the growth line. Glad to see the improvement in the pipeline. Could you just maybe give us a sense of where you're seeing it increased demand maybe by both segment and region?
Bob Fehlman: Sure. Yes David I'm glad to do that. I'll first start with this kind of geographically. Right now we're seeing nice opportunities in Texas, honestly Little Rock, Memphis, Nashville, Northwest Arkansas Kansas City they're all bringing nice opportunities to us. I think it's also important to know if you look at all of our community markets just where the low trough was to now they're up $300 million in their pipeline. So each one of those community markets for us are also building back for new business opportunities. Around the segments it continues to be owner occupied real estate. Equipment has been a nice space for us back half of ‘20 and then going into 2021. Industrial warehouse continues to do well. Single-family construction, we're seeing some nice opportunities and very conservative leveraged finance opportunities meaning businesses buying business some private equity that's out there with this amount of liquidity. So we're able to do some transactions there and we're also right now David retooling some of our consumer products, our portfolio mortgage pricing those are areas that now that we have so much more solid footing on the economy, we're getting little more competitive in those  products as well.
David Feaster: Okay. That's helpful and then just I guess again it's great to see the growth there. I guess how much of the growth would you estimates from an improvement of the economy and improving demand for credit versus maybe a higher appetite for credit on your front just given the improved economic outlook and maybe an acceleration of your sales efforts and hiring efforts?
Bob Fehlman: Okay. Yes. Good question. I think it's a little bit of a combination of both but really it's our bankers being back into the market and our borrowers seeing now visibility on opportunities that they can see how they play out more than anything else.
David Feaster: Okay. And then on asset quality, I mean asset qualities continued to improve, had a lower provision this quarter but the reserve ratio actually increased. Just in light of the improved economic outlook and the improved credit quality how do you think about the opportunity to release reserves at some point? Would you prefer to maybe grow into your reserve base or maybe outright release reserves just how are you thinking about that? Maybe where do you see a more normalized reserve ratio on the other side?
George Makris: Hey David, this is George. I'll start that conversation. During this quarter we're going to do a deep dive into two areas of our portfolio. It'd be office and retail like we've done with hotel previously. We are very comfortable today with our credit coverage and we would certainly prefer to grow into that allowance base. I'm not sure that's actually going to happen in the second quarter but until we do a deep dive into those areas that we believe will see some lag and deterioration and that is office and retail, we're not comfortable releasing any of the provision today. Now at the end of the second quarter we may see things differently after we do this deep dive but we need to go in and check renewals, renewal rates, demand for office space in some of our key markets, we need to make sure that our strip centers are renewing at normal rates; all that kind of deep dive will be done this quarter. So we'll have a better idea of those portfolio segments then. I will say this that we think we did a great job in our hotel portfolio identifying risk. You can see that there is a substantial allowance against that market segment. Those hotels are starting to perform much better. So it could be that we see an improved outlook in that segment as well. So stay tuned. Second quarter is going to be a really key quarter for us as we evaluate what we believe is in each one of those segments.
David Feaster: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks everybody.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Brady Gailey with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brady Gailey: Hey, thank you. Good morning guys.
George Makris: Good morning Brad.
Bob Fehlman: Good morning.
Brady Gailey: I wanted to start with the net interest margin or it might be easier to look at it in NII dollars instead of margin but do you think that this quarter, do you think that the first quarter of ‘21 is kind of the bottom from an NII or a NIM perspective and we should see growth and both of those going forward?
George Makris: Brady, I'm going to start that and then Bob could talk about the overall outlook but there is a measurement that we use internally that's really a core measurement. It compares our loan yield to our deposit cost. We call it our raw net interest yield. That's really what we take a look at to see how we're performing in the market from a pricing and profitability standpoint. That number it turns out to be around 4% and it has been consistent for well over a year. So even with a decline in our loan portfolio we've been able to manage the yield on our loan portfolio and our deposit costs proportionately during that period of time. So we're very pleased with that. Our net interest margin is getting killed but because of the liquidity. I mean just as everybody else is and you saw our continued deposit growth in the first quarter probably outpacing most other banks. We're not turning away any deposits. We're pricing them appropriately so to the extent that liquidity keeps coming in the bank, our margin is going to be our net interest income is going to be challenged but from a loan and deposit standpoint we feel very good about how we're managing that in the marketplace. Bob you might want to talk more.
Bob Fehlman: Yes. George hit it but Brady if you look at the quarter I think we thought at the end of the year we were at the low end of at the margin. When you look at it but for the quarter when loans are down what they were down PPP paid down seasonality and at which we would expect in credit card as Matt said. On the other side our deposits grew $1.2 billion and we put about $1.3 billion in the security portfolio. So we expected to see slight flat to slight improvement. However, again you can't grow your earning assets and put it in cash and improve the margin and that's what happened. So as George said it all comes back to liquidity and we're still estimating it's about 35 basis points related to the liquidity, some on the PPP. So it's still, we're still in that low 230 range when you look at our NIM, I'm sorry 330 George corrects me again. 330 on the NIM, so on a more normalized basis and again our cash while we thought cash would go down in the quarter because deposits went up worse than that $3.9 billion in cash at the end of the quarter.
Brady Gailey: Okay. And then I also just wanted to ask you the stock has done well here recently. So now you're trading at about 1.9 times tangible book value which I guess makes buybacks a little less compelling but on the flip side you have a currency that is stronger than it's been for a while so that helps out on your M&A efforts. How do you think about relative to the stock rates how buybacks and M&A fits into Simmons this year?
George Makris: Well, we still have an active buyback program and quite honestly dips in the market like we're experiencing today when the whole industry goes down a little bit creates good buying opportunities. So we'll consider that again. From an M&A perspective, I would say our  card is filling up. We're very active in discussions today. Many of those were ongoing before COVID hit, so we just picked them back up. So we think that that is a great opportunity for us especially with the value of our currency today. So I would tell you both of those are certainly viable uses of our capital.
Brady Gailey: Yes and George remind us, I mean we've seen several transactions in the space with notable kind of transformational deals kind of like Bancorp South and cadence that we saw I think last week. How would you guys consider doing a merger that's almost like MOE where you're partnering with a very large institution and putting the two companies together?
George Makris: Well, those are always tough and they don't happen overnight. The social issues Brady associated with something like that are tremendous and I will be honest with you. We've been a real beneficiary of some of those MOEs in our ability to hire some really good folks who come over and are making a huge contribution at Simmons. That's a natural thing to expect in an MOE. You don't need two of everything or four of everything and how that plays out is a real key to whether or not that's a successful transaction or not. We're not in a position where we have any reason to believe that we need to downsize a Simmons organization through an MOE. In fact, we're building for the future creating that next generation of leadership and we expect Simmons to be a real survivor going forward. So I would tell you that it would have to be a very special circumstance for us to consider an MOE. We see great opportunity, particularly in the footprint that we're in currently to continue to build share in key markets. Then we've mentioned those before Nashville, Memphis, St. Louis, Kansas City, the DFW footprint, Oklahoma City Tulsa; all of those are great opportunities for us either through organic growth or M&A. So we'll just stay the course and continue to do what we do pretty well.
Brady Gailey: Great. That makes sense. Thanks guys.
George Makris: Brady.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Gary Tenner: Thank you. Good morning.
George Makris: Good morning Gary.
Gary Tenner: I wanted to just to kind of get a sense of how you're thinking about expectations for liquidity. I think you made a comment that you kind of view the securities portfolio as being pretty fully invested and even a more typical pace of loan growth in back half of the year obviously will be plenty of funding availability there. So I'm just wondering as you're thinking about the back half of the year and deposit flows, how much of your expectations there are being conservative in case of deposit outflow or do you have a better beat on where you think things may head back half of the year gone by?
Bob Fehlman: Well, this is Bob. I'd say first off liquidity has been a challenge to gauge this last year to go back to the beginning of the crisis. We built up liquidity to be able to protect our company. Since then we've had more liquidity just like everybody else than we really know what to do with at this time. So we don't -- I don't think any bank can tell you what is this temporary funding on liquidity today. Our estimate is it's in that billion to billion and five. That's what we're preparing for in case it runs off take all the stimulus money came into individuals, all the stimulus that came into businesses through PPP. When those loans pay off it's going to continue. So we're still at another -- I would say the balance of this year still trying to manage through this liquidity to try and figure out how do we best invest it but yet protect our company and be ready for when there is some runoff on it.
George Makris: Gary, I'll give you an example. We're getting into Ag  so we have looked at renewing all of our Ag production loans but our farmers had a great year last year even without the stimulus and when you add that money on top of a profitable year for the farmers typically what we would see is they'll use their money first and our money last. So I would expect that from a normal year perspective we will see a delay in funding and maybe a top level of funding that may or may not hit what we did last year. So there is just so much money available to borrowers who are going to use that first before they come and borrow more money and that's the wild card to me is, I don't know what the velocity of that is going to be. It could happen in the second quarter and they could use most of them we'd be back in to the ball game in the third quarter. I just don't know and that's why we're trying to stay as flexible as we can. $3.9 billion of cash is much more cash than we would normally keep but we also don't feel comfortable investing most of that in a multi-year securities portfolio and that's why Bob said we're taking a look at some variable-rate short-term instruments to protect that liquid aspect of that cash.
Bob Fehlman: One other point to make is cost of deposits did improve 4 basis points. We think there's still some room that there is probably another 3 to 5 basis points in the coming quarters. We're continuing to work on that a little bit by a little bit and still retain core customers but still realize the benefit we can on that. So it was a positive for the quarter.
Gary Tenner: Great. Thank you for that detail and then just a follow-up. You all been pretty active the past year plus in terms of rationalizing the branch infrastructure, selling some branches, closing others. Just wondering is there anything of size left within the branch footprint to rationalize or would it be more one-offs if anything from here?
George Makris: Gary, we have a little bit of room left. I think we've gotten a low-hanging fruit but here is really what you should expect from us going forward particularly in metro markets where we have multiple branches. We will probably reduce the number of locations but we will also establish corporate offices in many of those markets. So we will support hiring new lenders, new treasury management folks, new wealth folks into more of a corporate headquarters facility instead of spreading them out throughout the marketplace. Now we'll still have branches but we won't need as many from a transactional perspective as all banks have realized the use of our digital medium has just continued to go up and up and up and the use of our branches for deposits and cashing checks has become less and less. So fewer need for transactional branches, more need for corporate offices in these communities. That's going to translate into fewer locations. I'm not sure it's really going to translate into cost rate.
Gary Tenner: Great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.
Bob Fehlman: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you.  And our next question comes from line of  with Stephens Inc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. I'm in for Matt Olney. I have a question regarding your core loan yields. So the outlook calls for stable colonials and I'm assuming this means the 4.53 that you guys have on slide 24. Can you guys help me appreciate why there won't be additional loan compression when on slide 7 it has loan yields around 3.8%.
George Makris: That's just commercial.
Bob Fehlman: Yes. That's a really good question but the pipeline you see there that is just our commercial loan pipeline that does not encompass all our other opportunities there that would drive that yield higher.
George Makris: Some of that would be equipment finance, credit card, Ag lending. A lot of those others that are not in those numbers you see in the pipeline are at much higher yields. As you can see we had a blip down in Q3 but that was really not, that was just for that one quarter. We've been maintaining in that 450 for the last four or five quarters.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Makris for any further remarks.
George Makris: Okay. Thank you very much. So just to recap, I want to say this we are functioning in an artificial economy right now and to be able to predict and project based on the last few quarters is an effort in futility and we just have to be flexible and maintain our ability to take advantage of the opportunities that our customers see in the marketplace and I think we've done a good job of that. If you recall we began 2020 before COVID telling you that 2020 was an adjustment period for us and that included exiting our energy portfolio, exiting non-relationship credits particularly in commercial real estate, branch rationalization. I think when you look back over 2020 we hit all three of those out of the park. I want to give a perspective because I think these four metrics really define what we're going through today. If you will notice our deposits year-over-year are up 17%. Our credit card fees are up 14%. So people that have money are spending money. However, our service charges are down 27% year-over-year which reflects that excess liquidity that's in the marketplace today and while our card fees are up 14%, our card balances are down 7%. Until we work through that artificial liquidity it's hard for us to really gauge what normal looks like going forward. We're trying to keep an eye on it but I've been wrong more than I've been right and I would hate to try to predict the timing of back to normal. So once again flexibility in our system is extremely important and I think we've set ourselves up to be extremely successful not only for the bank but for the communities we serve as we come out of COVID in this artificial economy. Now I want to end on a really high note here and I want to take the opportunity to recognize the young man that we got to know a little over a year and a half ago and that's Will Zalatoris. You all may know Will because he got a lot of air time a couple of weeks ago. Will is a professional golfer. He's on team Simmons and he finished second at the Masters last week losing by one shot. You probably may not remember that earlier last year Will finished sixth in the U.S. Open. A real success story and the epitome of dreams realized which is our tagline here at Simmons. We also have three other members of team Simmons; Dawson Armstrong, Kevin Dougherty and Braden Thornberry who've had great success on the Korn Ferry TOUR and will be highlighted at the Simmons Bank open in two weeks in Nashville. So just a shout out to those fine young men and we appreciate what they've done in representing Simmons bank in a very important demographic segment for us. Thanks for joining us today and I hope you have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."
