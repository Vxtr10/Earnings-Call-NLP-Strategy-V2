"Sal DiMartino: Good morning, everyone. This is Sal DiMartino, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the management team of New York Community Bancorp for today's conference call. Today's discussion of the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2020 performance will be led by President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Cangemi; and Chief Financial Officer, John Pinto, together with Chief Operating Officer, Robert Wann.
Thomas Cangemi: Thank you, Sal. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast, and thank you for joining us today. Before turning to the financial detail, I'd like to take the opportunity to introduce our new CFO, John Pinto, to everyone on the call. As you know, John Pinto was named CFO at the end of last year succeeding me into that position as I transition to the role of President and CEO. John and I have worked together for 22 years going back to the time with Richmond County Bancorp and we have worked very closely since we both joined New York Community in 2001. Going forward, John, will be spending more time with the analyst and investment community. Please join me in wishing him well as I know that he will do a terrific job as the company's new CFO. Now turning over to the results. Earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.39 on a GAAP basis for the three months ended December 31, 2020, up 70% compared to the year-ago quarter, and up 95% compared to the previous quarter. For the full-year, we reported $1.02 per share on a GAAP basis, up 32% compared to last year. These numbers included an income tax benefit of $55.3 million for the quarter and $68.4 million for the year related to certain tax provisions of the CARES Act.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. . The first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank America Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ebrahim Poonawala: Good morning, Tom.
Thomas Cangemi: Good morning, Ebrahim. How are you?
Ebrahim Poonawala: Good. So first of all, congrats on the CEO appointment. And just talk to us about expense outlook. I know expenses picked up higher in the fourth quarter. But I heard you talk about some potential for branch savings. But -- and I understand that you will not be ready to have all the details on that. But just give us a sense of where expenses should trend as we look forward into the next quarter over the next year, if you can talk to 2021?
Thomas Cangemi: Okay, sure Ebrahim. So, I would say that, yes, we have some movement on the expense in the fourth quarter, again, driven from my previous commentary. The movements from classified assets for us, obviously, there's a cost of that, we're very comfortable with managing through this difficult time on the classification side. However, that does come at a cost. So FDIC expenses, on accrual basis has elevated significantly over the past or call it six months, had a significant contribution to the fourth quarter, as well as some taxi medallion related expenses about $1.08 million on tax medallion. The differential, I'll stay off of my guide were driven off FDIC costs, those costs will continue. So I'd say for the -- well this gives us Q1 guide, 1.34 is my estimate. So it's pretty much flat, while for the fourth quarter, and typically Q1 quarter high for the bank. So I'd say Q1 is around 1.34, you can kind of think about annualization somewhere between 5.30, John, 535-ish 5.30 to 5.35 and I think that's a reasonable run rate again, but again I'm not yet prepared to give that as a full guide for 2021. But on a quarterly perspective, I think we're going to be pretty much close to Q4 and obviously that typically is a quarter high in Q1 versus previous years when we compare.
Ebrahim Poonawala: And how soon should we expect you to have an update just around branch rationalization? And what you want to do like, what's the reasonable timeframe, when we should expect an update?
Thomas Cangemi: So what we look at the branches all the time as part of our business model, we're very focused on the real estate side. We had a handful of branches that we evaluated last year I think it was a total of 14 branches that we put on the table for potential reshuffling. And that continues and we're going to go through all our operations. Obviously, the world is changing regarding banking, and we're going to look at our branch structure. And we see deficiencies now will move opportunistically. So I would say stay tuned, don't expect to see a major restructuring on the branches unless we have a major deal to win a house. So, but we'll -- from time-to-time we do go through our leases that come due, we look at the run rate as far as the economics of exiting one, and we'll be opportunistic, depending on market conditions.
Ebrahim Poonawala: Got it. And I guess, just moving to the margin, so I think you still have, you flagged a fair amount of high cost CDs coming up and debt coming up for maturity. Just tell us in terms of the refi costs for these and just your expectation on the core margin going forward?
Thomas Cangemi: Yes. So -- we -- as everyone knows, we had a lot of opportunities in 2020, given where we were and where we're today. I still believe that we're going to see historical lows in our cost of funds, in particular on the retail side. So I would say with certainty in Q1, we will be at our historical low. I believe that was around 50 basis points as a historical low, we'll probably break that in Q1, that's going to be an ongoing phenomenon throughout the year, assuming rates stay close to zero. So I think it's fair to say that given the level of excess liquidity put on given the balance sheet, and what we expect to redeploy some of that excess cash would probably cost us about two basis points in Q4 and probably two basis points in Q1. I can safely guide between three to five basis points improvement in the first quarter obviously albeit at a slower pace than the previous year but given the magnitude of the drop of the CD book. And the CD portfolio, as well as overall cost of deposit should decline, my guess is by the third quarter, somewhere below 40 basis points could be 35 to 38 basis points, depending how many of these customers go into a much lower liability instrument. So I think we're going to see margin expansion throughout 2021, throughout the year. We'll guide up for the quarter three to five basis points in Q1. And I think what's on the table now is what happens with the shape of the yield curve. We have some nice gyrations in the fourth quarter that continues in the backend stuff to improve the year. Our customers will probably come to the table and look to accelerate refinancing and we'll be there to serve a nice spread in this environment in a healthy multifamily market. The multifamily market has been extremely healthy despite the pandemic. So, if you look at all the asset classes, people are paying their rents were predominantly a niche player in a rent regulated space and if refinancing happening on a daily basis. So we hope that we see a better yield curve that could also drive the margin higher.
Ebrahim Poonawala: Got it. And if I can just squeeze in one more on the multifamily market, you mentioned GSE competitive, got more competitive towards the end of the year. Just give us the outlook. Do you see this portfolio, multifamily portfolio growing and what's kind of the feedback you're getting from your borrower base in terms of what they're looking to do?
Thomas Cangemi: Well 2020 was a very interesting year. The GSEs are very competitive before the pandemic. They put us to compete with a very significant level in January, February, March, pandemic hit, they disappeared. Literally, they -- believe we were in business in Q2, and spreads gapped out, we were doing some really solid business, we had good growth, but Q1 of 2020 was competitive. And I'd say for Q2 and Q3 they were kind of trying to fill their roles of the quota versus tightening up their underwriting standards, taking through the pandemic, and social distancing and taking money out, remote origination. And then by Q3, Q4 they kind of figured that out in a very strong way had to fill their coffers and fourth quarter was very noticeable as many customers evaluated the rate environment. Lot of those commitments were probably done in Q3, they closed in Q4. We did a really strong job on protecting the loan books. So we've actually executed with some of our larger customers protect these great relationships and we competed against the GSEs. However, there was some loans that went away, given the market conditions as the yields were low and the dollars were heavy. And again, we protect the credit of the portfolio; it's all about the long-term credit metrics of this bank. And clearly, looking at some of the deals that were on the table, we let them go and you can see the elevation of prepayment activity. As we stand today, in January, it appears that is less storybook loans going away to the GSEs as of today, they filled their coffers last year, and we'll see what happens as we go forward here. But if there's a sloping yield curve, and the back end starts to spike up higher, typically what happens customers go back to the portfolio lenders, five and seven year money becomes more of the product issuer and we tend to be very competitive there. So right now it seems like we're setting ourselves up for growth as we go into 2021, 3% to 5% tight net multifamily loan growth is reasonable, I'd like to be at around 5%. I think it's achievable. However, the shape of the yield curve will really depend on the level of activity. If there is a spike in the yield curve, we think a lot of these customers that are coming due will accelerate refinance, we'll be ready to lend.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgibbon of Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.
Thomas Cangemi: Good morning, Mark.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Hey, guys good morning. Tom, congrats to you and John on your new roles.
Thomas Cangemi: Thank you.
John Pinto: Thank you, Mark.
Mark Fitzgibbon: First question, I had Tom just to clarify on that three to five basis point guide on the NIM that you gave, I assume that excludes prepayment penalty income?
Thomas Cangemi: That's correct, Mark. We don't guide prepayment penalty income. That's correct.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. Okay. And then secondly, it sounded like from your comments that we'll see some changes on the liability side of the balance sheet. Are there also some new lending niches that you'd consider? And I guess I'm curious what those might be.
Thomas Cangemi: So Mark, well, there's a level of excitement here, culturally. We've always been all about the credit in service extremely well, but this is an opportunity here, I've been saying this for many years, the low lying fruit of the full relationship lending is out there. I'd say complementary lines of business. For example, we have a very wealthy family who was looking for a line of credit; we tend not to service lines of credit. That's it. That's it, that's an easy exercise for us. We know the customer, we know the opportunity, we're very comfortable with the history, no reason we should not have a line of credit with a strong borrower, that relates into more relationship lending, more deposit flows. We're getting better deposit flows historically, but we have so much work to do. That is my emphasis. I believe that our loan book has not yet been fully tapped in respect to relationship lending. And the Fiserv conversion that we invoke last year was a major cost different conversion. And more importantly, our cash flow management system is right on par with the largest commercial banks. So there's no excuses that our system does not compare to a Capital One or to a local commercial bank that we compete against. So we feel very comfortable there. But we may have to tweak a little bit on the service side, tweak on the relationship lending side that will happen over time. But I think there's tremendous low lying opportunity that we will aggressively go after. So I do hope that our customers are on the line here because we have a commitment. We want to bank you full service. It comes down to the lease amount that comes on, and so the lease agreements we should be getting as a matter of course, the operating accounts and the full relationship. So there's going to be a push, I'd say funding on a daily basis. Yes, I think my staff is getting sick of hearing it. But that's where I'm at. I think this is the opportunity. To change the thrift model on the funding side and we'll get the pure commercial banking opportunity within our customer base. As far as new lines of businesses, I'd say it's going to be complementary to our customer base. We do lend commercial and multifamily for these families. But lines of credit opportunities that arise, we're going to bank them. But more importantly, and I say this with clarity, we are looking at all unique things in the marketplace. And we're very comfortable, as we did with specialty finance, bringing in a team of people from the outside management list out, these are things that we're looking at today, we have no problem bringing on lines of business that we're comfortable on managing as the credit risk. So we're clearly looking to a diversification over time, it's not going to be a build-out from scratch, I can assure you that, I'm not going to make an announcement that we're investing in the residential market, and we're setting up a new residential portfolio. We'll go into partner, partnerships, we'll get it done a lot quicker and it will make rational sense.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Great. And then I guess, does your expense guide of 5.30 to 5.35 imply much hiring? Or will that be incremental as you sort of over time go through?
Thomas Cangemi: No, Mark. I'd say the big expense will come, when we do something strategic, okay. So it's going to be blended in accretive opportunity. I'd say we're going to reshuffle the deck, we're looking at lines of business, I'm going through the entire bank right now, we'll go into all aspects of how we lend the processes, we'll do some reshuffling and look maybe service people, such relationship people. By the end of the day, I think it's not going to be material adjustment to those -- that guide I gave you, I think it's going to be more indicative towards revenue generation. So I would say that that guide has some reshuffling internally, no real restructuring of the employee base. We're going to -- we have a huge opportunity on the system side. And we have a lot of people that can utilize in other departments to work with the customer side. So we're going to try to find catch a balance, and hopefully, keep the expenses tight in these difficult banking environment but also focus on revenue opportunities within the franchise. So I think, maybe we'll get a few hires here and there, down the road on the service side but ultimately, I want to reemphasize this low lying fruit here that needs to be picked and we'll pick it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW. Please proceed with your questions.
Thomas Cangemi: Good morning, Chris.
Chris McGratty: Good morning, thanks for the question. Tom, maybe if you could start with just the change in the balance sheet in the securities portfolio and the cash position. Given the build in the quarter, how should we think about the progression of that, the non-loan going?
Thomas Cangemi: Chris, I'm going to defer this quote to John -- John, this question to John.
Chris McGratty: Yes, John.
John Pinto: Sure, thanks Chris. So we did, as Tom mentioned in his opening statements, we did add some cash and started to increase our securities portfolio in the fourth quarter. Over the last couple of quarters and years, that securities portfolio has drifted down, pretty significantly to drop below 10% of securities assets. So we wanted to take advantage of the rate environment at the time, put on some term borrowings at the end of the fourth quarter, to enhance our liquidity position, and over time, put that into securities and partially into loans, depending of course on loan growth. And we expect to do that in the first quarter and into the first half of the year.
Chris McGratty: Great. And then on the strategic side, I mean historically, acquisitions have been primarily funding-related, I'm interested in with the change in the leadership, are there opportunities for notable funding to drop onto the balance sheet and improve? Or is it more an asset availability?
Thomas Cangemi: I would say combination of both. I would tell you that we're looking at everything that's available, deposit opportunities are real. Their they exist. We're going to be very carefully evaluating those opportunities, as well as businesses that focus on deposit gathering efforts. There is a interesting amount of unique opportunities out there that have the ability to gather liability, either these are non-FDIC insured institutions or they have a business that has a bank that may own this type of business that is shredding that type of business. So clearly looking at everything. We bid on stuff in the past, we've lost. We're not a, we will not call an aggressive buyer of anything, but we do look at a lot of stuff. And clearly, like I indicated the deposit side of the balance sheet here, if we refocus the energy, I believe we can get two to three multiple turn on the stock, if we change our funding mix. Being so dependent on wholesale finance, as a thrift, without doing a large transaction for over a decade impacts our multiple. I believe, as we turn that multiple into more of a core deposit opportunity, you can see a two to three multiple turn and get that valuation back. So we're razor-focused there, doesn't mean we're going to be successful on winning opportunities. But we're very much looking at deposit opportunities as well as whole bank M&A. I mean there's no question that we're in a environment that mergers and acquisitions makes a lot of sense. The scale is important. We believe we have a very unique system upgrade where other banks in our own backyard have not done it yet. They're going to have to do it in the next two or three years. So it's very interesting just to join the family, and with the kind of systems here and we could prosper together over time, I think that opportunity exists. So we're excited about that. And I go back to the cash flow management solution, that's really exciting because historically, that was some of the pet peeves we've had where there was criticism on not being able to have the same technology as some of the larger commercial banks. Well now we have that technology, no reason to not have the full deposit relationships. So we have a lot of enthusiasm on the system side, our people worked very hard. This was a three-year project in the making. So if one's thinking about making this conversion, it's a three-year project. And we did it in the middle of COVID; we actually closed the conversion in August of 2020, even though it was postponed year after year to do it right. This was a major upgrade for the company. So we're excited about that. And this will help us on consolidation as well.
Chris McGratty: Great. And then if I could just given the newness of your seat in the internal focus, announcing a deal or a strategic transaction, you'd be comfortable doing that kind of in the first part of the year given everything that's going on?
Thomas Cangemi: We're doing this a long time. I'm very comfortable on strategic business combinations. This is not about ego. This is about shareholder value and we will be very shareholder orientated. That's my history. That's my background. I've been doing this for quite for multiple decades alongside with Mr. Ficalora, he said there's new leadership here. And clearly, we put the egos aside is all about doing the right thing to shareholders.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.
Thomas Cangemi: Good morning, Brock. I guess we lost Brock.
Operator: Brock, is your phone on mute?
Brock Vandervliet: Sorry about that. That always helps. So good morning. I wondered if we could go to expenses. I guess I'm struggling a little bit with the -- with the guide here, which was very clear. And I just want to understand kind of what's changed versus basically flat expenses or very little growth on the expense side?
Thomas Cangemi: Well, I think, Brock there is no question. And this is, by the way, slightly higher than the previous year, we had some one-timers last year. But the change in the run rate is that we have FDIC costs affiliated with banks that are now -- loans that are now criticized. We have a bucket of loans that went through COVID, went through the CARES Act and we reevaluate those credits. And they go into special mention substandard and we have to apply an FDIC assessment to get that risk. Very comfortable, by the way, managing that risk, very comfortable as far as dealing with the loan books. However, there is a cost to that. So I'd say the elevation on FDIC loans got to be between $10 million and $12 million minimum. And we hope that that starts to stabilize by first, second quarter, and then from there, as these loans get back to filling their leases, getting tenants back into these units and/or storefronts, you start to get them back into a what -- out of a watch class asset. So I think that's really what's driving year-over-year at the same time, we've always been monitoring our expenses, we're very efficient as a company. And I think we're going to see the benefit on an efficiency ratio perspective, because the margin is stronger better efficiency ratio numbers. But clearly going back to -- I'll reiterate back to when we were trying to become a stiffy bank, our expenses worth $660 million run rate, we knocked it down to the low fives, we're still operating in the low fives. But that that investment that we made in systems, in risk management, we have tremendous back office function that we built to be a much bigger bank, we have not yet grown the bank through acquisition. So we were very confident that when the opportunity arises, we have the back office and platform to leverage the expense base. But the guide is what it is, I think it's reasonable. Don't expect to see a major reinvestment out, because if the system conversion is done, money has been put into this system, there is opportunities, but they're going to be from time to time maybe some small list-outs some here or there local banks that we can check out, some deposit gatherers that will probably go after aggressively. And I don't think it's going to be meaningful enough to change my guide because I reshuffle with that within the organization.
Brock Vandervliet: Got it. And could you just revisit the GSE dynamic? We can see that depending on your, I look at 210s, for example, that has steepened pretty materially. It did so in Q4, what is -- what's driving that competitiveness and is some of it the fact that landlords are looking for any way to materially control costs, including interest costs given the aftermath of the rent act like is that driving it or is it just the GSEs or back end big?
Thomas Cangemi: Number of factors, riding it. I mean obviously, let's start with rate, rate is rate if you can get a coupon sub 3% and take it over high over 10 years, competitive rate, right. So if you think about how this process works, you're going to size up a deal, let's say was Q2, end of Q2 and closing in Q4. So you really need to look at the rate environment throughout the COVID scenario, right. So I go back to what happened in the first quarter of 2020. They were competitive. And out of the gate, we still threw our portfolio Q1 of 2020, and then Q2, we were in business with higher spreads, we fine-tuned our underwriting, and we did some great business with the GSEs I think were distracted, because it was COVID. It was figuring out how to remote originate, our guys have the ability to do paperless remote origination that was a major upgrade for the company that was back in the end of 2019. We have the New Gen system, so it's all remote. So our people are open for business on a daily basis doing great originations, but we capitalize on Q2. And then rates were generally low in general in Q3, and that's right -- again Q2 into Q3, I think a lot of the larger customers looked at the market and said, rates are low, there's not a real, there's no real purchase and sale activity. So let's lock in long and put the money on the shelf with the GSEs. And it's a competitive rate. And by the way, we've competed with some of those great customers to ensure we don't lose that business. So we've had some large transactions. And we would have fierce competition in Q4 because we size it up in the middle of the year, give it anywhere from three to six months to close. And my guys talking to shareholders our flow through at the end of the year was flat to down and we squeaked out some growth in Q4. So we were very pleased. But that was a fierce quarter in Q4. And the good news today is that when I speak to my lending people on a daily basis, it seems that you have not sizeable deals going away. We have a nice pipeline; we have a nice new money pipeline. So we should be back in the position of growth. And the GSE sold a lot of their coffers last year, and they had to fill at the end of the year. And they started fresh again. So let's hope that will be competitive, but nothing new here. We've always competed with the government. And if rates start to tick up, I think the product issuer will be five and seven year money and the spreads are healthy. If I can get 300 basis points or 275 to 300 on five, seven year money, but on a risk adjusted basis, we can do good business there because the credit losses are de-minimis, it's not zero.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Alexopoulos: Hey, good morning everybody.
Thomas Cangemi: Good morning. Steven, how are you? Good morning.
Steven Alexopoulos: Good. Thanks, Tom. I wanted to start Tom, regarding your vision to improve the funding base of the company. It sounds like you might need an M&A deal to move the needle. With that said, you no longer have a premium currency, are you still committed to a deal needing to be tangible book value accretive out of the gate?
Thomas Cangemi: Well, holistically we looked at that as value creation. So I would say to you, there's going to be two prong approach, we're going to work within the franchise as we discussed within our own operations, we think there's a tremendous low lying fruit opportunity. That's priority number one. We're open for opportunities. I mean, to change the diversity of the lending book and try to take on new products that are new to the bank and really try to drive this into a commercial enterprise, it will be an M&A transaction that does so and depending on market conditions, I look at the environment historically is that we like to do transactions where no premium type transactions where tangible book value is preserved. But we'll be -- we could be flexible. I mean, at the end of the day, if we could put a highly accretive transaction on the table, and the earn back is de-minimis, we will consider that. But I will still say fundamentally, taking tangible book value down is not the best idea of creating value. So we'll be open to interesting ideas. It depends on the opportunity right, depends on the earnings power of the partner, and I don't call them targets, I call them partners. We don't do targets because at the end of the day, we have to bring the people over from the other side to become partners. The best transactions are done when you have partners at the table. We build it -- we build a table, everyone sits around who's our partner, if you have good partnerships, you can create real value. I think that's the approach. Nothing's changed here other than we had some leadership change. And as I said before, the reality is that we run this company for our shareholders, and we look at the opportunity in the marketplace, it's a shareholder driven opportunity. There have been some large M&A transactions where low to no premium deals, make a lot of sense, especially with the technology build that's going on out there. So we're very focused on doing the right thing for our shareholders.
Steven Alexopoulos: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the deferrals, if I look at the $6 billion of deferrals that are now current or paid-off, were any of those rolled into the 6% of loans like insurance to affiliates that are now IOs and what types of loans are in that $2.5 billion bucket of IOs?
Thomas Cangemi: So absolutely. So again, I'm going to go back to the point about the GSEs. A lot of these loans that went into IO also could go to the GSEs on a 10-year IO structure. So no question that was the market. And when we looked at the loans that came off the CARES Act and literally went back to payments act that that was fabulous. But at the same time, we're acknowledging that you have this unique phenomenon called the Manhattan phenomenon, as the city's first to reopen of all the boroughs Manhattan is having the most difficult time on this record, getting back to somewhat of a normal. If you look at Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, in particular is doing extremely well. For us, I'd say that's the title of these assets are the ones that have more of a concentration of less rent regulation. So they happen to have some more market type apartments, you have storefronts that are retail fresh office, that will have more difficulties in Manhattan, and they wouldn't in Brooklyn, the Bronx to Long Island for sure. So the five boroughs, I'd say the area that we see impact is Manhattan, and I say, of that portfolio, I'll just be specific $2.5 billion, you have approximately $1.6 billion multifamily and about $800 million of commercial CRE, and on the office side is about $400 million, and the retail is about $200 million, and the LTV on the office 51%, blended for all of the CRE 54% and if you look at multi, it's about 53%. And when you look at these on a cash flow basis, as you apply a debt service coverage ratio on a cash flow basis, is still north of a one for one. So they could pay the service on it and they also can leave their bank and go to the GSEs if they choose to do so. So there's some of those types of others that have to lease up again, and we're working through that, utilizing the CARES Act and getting paid on a monthly basis. As I said, we have 99% of all our loans out of the non-pay status, which is pretty impressive, given the pandemic. But more importantly, I think what I find here when I dive into the portfolio, and we mined the data, you look at the fact that, the higher percentage of loans that have less rent regulation are the ones that are the IO potential, right, because the ones that have 100% rent regulation, they're paying, they're collecting, and there's no issue, which is -- it's a resilient market for that niche business. And we're going to continue being a dominant force for portfolio in that niche.
Steven Alexopoulos: Great. And maybe if I could squeeze one more in, in your opening comments, you said everything was on the table. And as we think about banking in the digital age, what's your view on preserving this local brand model you've had for years versus maybe consolidating everything under NYCB? Thanks.
Thomas Cangemi: Steven, you're getting really deep there, so. Okay. I'll tell you that look, at the end of the day, given our franchise, we have 242 branches running on Arizona, Ohio, down to Florida, down to South area of South Florida, New York, New Jersey. We have a very unique brand. But we also have a multiple brand concept, right. So it all depends on the partner, depends on the size of the transaction and the market. So if it's a Florida transaction, well, that's easy, the New York transaction is a little more complicated. But again, it comes down to what's right for shareholders, right? What's best for the shareholders, what makes a logical sense? And we're going to be very logical, and we're going to be disciplined. However, we have multiple brands in multiple markets. If you go to Ohio right now, we have Ohio Savings Bank, that used to be AmTrust, we rebranded back to Ohio, down in South East Florida, it's AmTrust, AmTrust does very well down there, doesn't mean we're wedded to anything. The reality is that if we are going to create something that's a regional platform, we have to do what's right for shareholders makes the most value creation. So we're open to all opportunities.
Steven Alexopoulos: Okay, great. Thanks for all the color and congrats.
Thomas Cangemi: By the way, Steven, I will tell you one before you go, we're got to make an investment on the rebranding we will do it to a transaction.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Steve Moss: Good morning. If I could start maybe on credit costs for the quarter wondering, how much is driven by the credit downgrades versus perhaps a little bit of an extension to the loan portfolio here?
Thomas Cangemi: You're saying, you repeat the credit cost you said?
Steve Moss: The drivers of credit cost, yes. Thanks.
Thomas Cangemi: That's right. So the actual charges we have is all I believe 100% medallion driven as we go on to medallion.
John Pinto: Primarily medallion driven on the charge-offs. On the provision, we booked which was lower than the third quarter and has been the trend each quarter in 2020 with lower provisions. The macro environment did get a little bit better. Housing prices got a little bit better, but we did have the increases in the classified and criticized assets that Tom mentioned. So from a qualitative perspective, we want to ensure that we cover those potential increases. We don't see a huge risk of loss there, as Tom mentioned earlier, but from the CECL perspective, we wanted to make sure we were covered.
Thomas Cangemi: That's right. It's interesting what John said, I would just follow-up on that commentary. Usually every quarter I kind of isolate the risk that we're seeing and few quarters back it was retail. And I said we'll see -- we'll watch the office portfolio, but we're paying attention very closely to Manhattan. It is what it is; it's the last borough that really is having a difficult time. And if you look at where we are on substandard special mention, it's 80% Manhattan, right. I mean, I mean, isolated down to a handful of loans, all-in it's about $449 million of multifamily and about $300 million of CRE broken out with literally 80% split to Manhattan. So I think that we have a good hand on this. The historical is that when we do a Manhattan transaction, it's typically the lowest leverage we have on the portfolio. Historically, we've had in Queens. And when you look at what -- the ones that migrate into what's called a classified situation, the LTV on the multi is about I believe that number is around 56%. And the CRE -- the overall CRE portfolio on LTV, I believe is about 58%, as well. So yes, for us that's slightly higher than the 40 something but for obvious reason, it needs a little bit more help. And when you apply an IO structure to these loans, they continue to cash flow out and also one to one for the most part, some don't, but for the vast majority do, and we're working through it, but no one's knocking on the door and returning the keys. They have real embedded value, as well as very strong sponsors that are willing to work it out. These are not CMBS pool; this is the unique way we lend. And if there's any risk at all, we tend to get a lot more folks into the opportunity where we will have real strength upon the eventual liquidation. Believe me, there's plenty of people who're loving to buy these assets, but they're not for sale. They're working through a difficult environment. And they're paying interest only. And we're getting and they're all on payment status, and they're paying their taxes to the city. So it's an encouraging outlook for us. I kind of ring centered now to Manhattan, and we're razor-focused on it. And we believe that as the reopening starts to take place, hopefully sooner rather than later, this should be hopefully the area that we'll talk about, hopefully by the end of the year that's stabilizing, but there's no guarantee that can happen, right.
Steve Moss: Right. And just on those IO mods, just kind of curious what the interest-only period is. And if you ask for any additional collateral?
Thomas Cangemi: Typically what we do, so the ones that came through the CARES Act and pay, they just continue, they go back to P&I and the ones that need a little bit help they've requested, we offered six months. So we'll take another hard look at them, which on April and May, again, April and May comes around. And I think that's, as the reopening starts to take place, a lot of these guys are on the cusp of going to the agency too. So we want to protect our business, you know that. And like I said before, in my opening comments, the agency is a fierce competitor. So these -- some of these loans could go there, even though they're considered on the cusp of we'll call it a special mention type asset, because of the lease up of the ground floor in particular. But I think a lot of these loans are in a very good spot where they actually can make these payments and protect their assets from going to all asset purchases. There's a tremendous amount of money out there that would love to buy these assets in the event, things go sideways, six months from now. So right now we're working through it.
Steve Moss: Okay, that's helpful. And if I can squeeze one last question in just on the securities purchases here for the quarter, just kind of curious, what are the yields? What kind of stuff in yields you're purchasing these days?
Thomas Cangemi: It's dismal. The yield as you've got, John, when you go to stand upon.
John Pinto: Yes, I mean, if you're looking at agency type paper, which is what we look at, you're in the mid-ones in the 1.50 range for good quality structured paper.
Thomas Cangemi: Yes. And if you think about, we have obviously tremendous amount of liquidity there's $2 billion cash in the balance, you had zero. So that's going to be deployed hopefully into our loan book, as well as security. So in my margin guide, I'm very conservative on the deployment of that excess cash. But we do have excess liquidity if we put out some money long, as a matter of taking advantage of the structure of the curve, we still have a lot of wholesale finances that had to be restructured over time and going forward even in this quarter, we have about $200 million -- $325 million at a 2.36 market 50 basis point. So that's something that we look to probably lock-in long instead  of going overnight. And then I think the next big slug of money comes in 2022, which is about a 140. So we have time on that, so that we're not going to restructure that too far out of the money. And I think what's really interesting in 2020, the beginning is going to is that we have $2 billion on a macro hedge against fixed first, the float on the multifamily side, if rates stay low for longer, we will just remove it. And that's another 10 to 12 basis points on our margin for 2022. So we were hedged there and as we grind through 2021, that'll also be upside for the margin. Depending on interest rates, we may keep it honest, rates are rising for some reason, and we're in a strong economy and everything is behind us. But my view is that that's probably not going to happen in 12 months and that hedge could be something that's also beneficial to the margin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with question.
Ken Zerbe: Great, good morning. Just in terms of the taxes, if given the change in the administration, if we do get a tax increase, what does that imply for your overall tax rate? And have you or can you do anything to kind of minimize that that hit versus in terms of tax strategy?
Thomas Cangemi: So that's a pretty simple question. Obviously, if rates go up, we pay more taxes. That's possible. I think it's more of a 2022 phenomenon, not help us on the 2021 phenomenon, but now they took it down to 21% from 28%, let's talk about 28%, from a much higher level and that would impact a bank that such as ours to a point where is it going to be dollar for dollar? I would say that we're going to be very proactive on managing our tax structure, which we were very focused on, but no question that higher taxes means less profitability. Right, John, if you want to add anything?
Ken Zerbe: I should have been more clear with my question. Yes, if it goes from 21% to 28%, that's a 7% increase, what is the percentage increase in your effective tax rate? Thanks.
John Pinto: Yes, it would be just below the 7%, right. So it would probably be in the mid-6s. It would go up. And that's excluding any other tax planning items that we would do.
Thomas Cangemi: Right, right.
Ken Zerbe: Got it. But just to be clear is there any other tax planning items that you can do? And help me with those strategies?
John Pinto: Yes, we haven't played much on the federal side in the past; I mean you can see that in our rate currently, right. So that's not something we normally, we would normally look at. But as we've looked at in the past, we'll do it in the future.
Thomas Cangemi: Let's hope we get to 2021 where they don't raise taxes we do is what it is and 2022 is probably more probable if it happens then we will do with it.
Ken Zerbe: That’s what we're hearing right now right is that not in the middle of the pandemic, but it could be in 2022. All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please proceed with your questions.
Thomas Cangemi: Good morning, Dave.
Dave Rochester: Hey, good morning. Congrats to all.
Thomas Cangemi: Thank you.
Dave Rochester: Tom, you've mentioned the NIM expansion beyond 1Q as well, for the rest of this year, I was just wondering if you think that three to five bps for 1Q or good pays per quarter, given what you're looking at now and your expectations on rates?
Thomas Cangemi: Maybe no NIM for long time, I don't give yearly guidance on the margin, so.
Dave Rochester: Give a try?
Thomas Cangemi: I know you try. But I will tell you that a lots going depend on the shape of the yield curve. We had some excitement in the fourth quarter with a bump-up in interest rates; I think that'll get the attention of many of the customers. If it spikes significantly, this margin expansion could be outperform what we expect. But meanwhile, when we run models we're running it conservatively; it's pretty much a flat curve environment. And we're showing the Q1 up a little bit here. I think we've probably lost about two BPS on the excess liquidity, if we put it out faster, we'll get it back. As you know, we've kept our securities portfolio below 10%, which is if you look at the median peer group, that's probably the lowest in the peer group. And it has to have a little bit of a bump here as we position ourselves to go longer out in the funding side and anticipate opportunities as we start to redeploy the balance sheet. And I don't think we're going to take it significantly from there. So let's say it goes from maybe 10% to 11%. But the cash position is very high right now; we'd like to put some of that money to work. And that's going to impact the margin, hopefully, favorably coming off of a zero return on cash.
Dave Rochester: Yes, okay. And then maybe on the loan side, where are you seeing new money yields now on multifamily and --?
Thomas Cangemi: Yes. So the pipeline yield, I believe, what was that, John, at 3.50 new money pipeline?
John Pinto: New money pipeline --
Thomas Cangemi: Bear with me.
John Pinto: Yes, 3.50.
Thomas Cangemi: Yes, so again low 3s competing tight on low 3s, duration is somewhat shorter. But we've been hovering around 3% if you apply that to the spread, it's a little bit tighter than we had liked. But it's coming off of the agencies desire to be more prolific on the lending side. That again the spread has been healthy between 2.75% to 3.15%, depending on the size of deal that we look at. And I think we're getting that 3% net, and then that's important. But the payoff was high, though the last quarterly payoff was a 3.75% and we originated 3.04%; it's still holding 3%. The interesting modeling question we have, what happens in 2021 if the yield curve steepens does that 3% go to 3.50% if we see a nice spike in the back end, so that could happen. There's no guarantee we’re modeling more of a conservative scenario and we're still seeing margin expansion.
Dave Rochester: Yes, okay. How much do you think you need the long-end to move up before the GSE competitiveness does start to decline?
Thomas Cangemi: I think when I really would spend time looking at the 10 year move with the 10 years especially  choosing 10 starts to move significantly here. I think customers will realize that economically, it may make sense just to go to the portfolio lenders and we're evaluating opportunities as far as synthetically getting them to stay with the bank on swap opportunities. We do not have a specific swap program internally, something that we are considering as a preventative edge to keep some customers from going to the GSEs synthetically view that and get some fees upfront. That's something that's on the table. But no questions is spread between I think Brock had said between twos and 10s, where you spend time evaluating that has been a nice move in the fourth quarter, if that continues, given the expectation of substantial deficit spending, and is a view that rates are going higher in the back end, that will move customers back to the five and seven year portfolio lenders space.
Dave Rochester: Yes, okay. Where were you guys adding borrowings for the quarter? And what do you think the rate is now?
Thomas Cangemi: I'd say 2.5 year to 3.5 years anywhere from 48 to 58 that spread, so it's cheap overall funding. And if we can't bring it on the funding side, we will look to rebalance interest rate risk by taking on an opportunity which is three year money around 50 basis points, which is pretty cheap.
Dave Rochester: Okay. And just switching to expenses, that extra $10 million to $12 million in additional FDIC expense this year that you mentioned, that should be dropping out of the run rate in 2022, right.
Thomas Cangemi:  it all depends on how bad the pandemic extend itself. And if there's New York City reopen, and as foot traffic start and people go back to work, and you'll see some pent-up demand are released. And I think that's the key. And I think that, we're being an abundance of caution moving assets into a classified bucket as we should be doing. And the biggest consequence today on that is that, it costs us money on the FDIC insurance.
Dave Rochester: Yes, that makes sense. And then on the loan growth outlook, I appreciate your thoughts there on the multifamily side. I think you said 3% to 5% there, what are your thoughts on the rest of the portfolio?
Thomas Cangemi: I think we had a substantial reduction last year on CRE, just a matter of the market that may be stabilizing a little bit it's something that we look at other areas on the CRE side, but let's just say CRE is flat to down 1% or 2%. I think we're going to see a nice up tick on specialty finance, given the amount that's outstanding and what's committed is close to $5 billion, committed $3.8 billion outstanding --
John Pinto: $3.1 billion.
Thomas Cangemi: $3 billion outstanding. I think there's a nice spread there of takedowns. We haven't seen the takedowns in Q4; we hope to see more takedowns as we go into the year. So they've had -- their CAGR have been off the chart since we built that business last year with the 17% CAGR. So I expect nice growth, probably what hopefully, it's consistent to the previous year. That was probably one of our worst years was the pandemic, when we do 17%. So you want to take a conservative look at that 17%, 15 to 18 there. And then you think about multifamily, if there is a change in the yield curve, we're going to retain a lot more business. And I think our guys have done an amazing job on retaining the business with data mining the portfolio, we're working with the brokers, we're ensuring that we have a good fair shot at these customers before they leave to go to the agency. And we'll be competitive. Now we have to do a little bit more IO absolutely. That's the market. But we're going to be selective there; we try to be viewed as a hybrid IO lender. We're not big on long-term IO. But time to time, we make those decisions depending on the customer relationship and a deposit relationship. We did a very large relationship in Q4 that was IO because of a substantial depository relationship. One of our very strong customers was pricing this against the agency and we competed. And we lose a little bit on the risk weighting side because it becomes a different risk weighting category. However, it's a great loan, great relationship and tons of deposits with it. So we have to be a fiercest competitor in this environment.
Dave Rochester: Okay. And then assuming that you guys continue to grow deposits, are you thinking that the securities growth should continue as well?
Thomas Cangemi: I guess on the security side, and John may want to expand on it. Go ahead, John?
John Pinto: Yes, we would expect it would grow but not dramatically from here, given what the cash position is and the securities, we expect maybe a little bit of growth in the first quarter, and then hopefully keep it pretty flat from there, depending on deposit growth.
Dave Rochester: Great. And then maybe just one --
Thomas Cangemi: Dave, on the deposit side, it’s not going to be traditional retail push, it's going to be the business push, which is close to zero cost of deposit. That's the difference.
Dave Rochester: Yes, that sounds good and then maybe just one last one on fees. You had a good step-up there in the fourth quarter. What's your outlook for fee growth in the first half or maybe for 2021?
Thomas Cangemi: Yes, we're assuming right now it's pretty flat to the fourth quarter. We're not assuming a big increase to fees. We have -- the third quarter had a lot more of the fees waived during the pandemic than the fourth. But we're conserve -- we're being conservative what we're forecasting there. We don't expect a big increase; it could be right around that fourth quarter number.
John Pinto: So Dave that goes back to the point of the blank canvas, we don't have a lot of fee income, eventually, if you're bringing products that's where the opportunity lies. We have a very large branch structure where we don't sell a lot of products to the branches. When you think about M&A and business partnerships, that's where a tremendous opportunity is that blank canvas that we can paint with new products going through the system. These are legacy branches going back. So in some cases to the 1800s that we really have a lot of goodwill within the community that could have these lines of businesses that are normal commercial bank lines of businesses that we don't have.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Winter: Good. Tom with this focus on deposit growth what do you think you're going to generate in terms of deposit growth this year? And what do you think the loan to deposit ratio could go to?
Thomas Cangemi: Yes, I'm not going to go to this. This is going to be a passionate push to look at processes, a passionate push to look at the low lying fruit. And we're going to update you guys on a quarterly basis, because it really is not going to be a public plan, it's going to be an emphasis towards culture, right. And culture here has been uniquely different when it comes to the lending side versus the deposit side. I want to reiterate the concept that we have so much low lying opportunity for these relationship that needs to be nurtured in mind, and obviously shown the technology that we have, and we should win more business with the existing customer base. At the same time, as we bring in new business, we did $12.9 billion originations last year. We should be able to get on every single loan a deposit relationship, as well as the potential full service deposit relationship. If we get 50% of it, we want. So I'm a guy about 100, I like 100. But if we get 50%, then we win. So we do a lot of volume feed, as you know, and the portfolio is relatively short. What we found when we evaluate the book, there's a lot of customers that stay with us that are within other portfolios, because it's difficult to move all your accounts and if you have a good relationship with a good relationship manager, they tend to, it's not as portable if you can win over that business. So I think we think about the volume we do, we get by the duration of the portfolio truly opportunistic year and it's more cultural. And the culture has been clear and this is the liability term comes out of my mouth at least seven, eight times a day. And that's where we are. So I'm not going to give you numbers that are fantasy, I'm going to give you numbers that are reality, and you'll see the growth over time. And if we don't do that, we'll fine tune it till we get there. We're going to get it right.
Peter Winter: Okay. That's fair. And then if I could just ask on the M&A front, the thoughts on maybe a bolt-on fee income acquisition to add some diversification and take market share that way?
Thomas Cangemi: Yes. Like I said, we're looking at all opportunities. I mean obviously, we will do accretive transactions; we don't want to do a transaction trying to take down earnings profile of the company. But we like to change the funding mix, we'd like to change augment the fee income opportunity, we'd like to start driving products to the branches. And we also like to look at the big picture that if we do this with a solid partnership that has all these array of products, then we can accelerate that something can happen in five to seven years. We can do it overnight. So like I said, on my opening comments, all options are on the table. We're very shareholder focused. We have a very unique franchise, we have a diverse franchise when it comes to geographic, and we could do a lot of things with it. So we're excited about opportunities. We're seeing a lot of great opportunities both on the deposit side as well as on strategic M&A.
Peter Winter: Got it, all right. Congrats, Tom and John for the promotions.
Thomas Cangemi: Thank you, Peter.
John Pinto: Thank you, Peter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Duong with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Thomas Cangemi: Good morning, Steve.
Steven Duong: Good morning, guys. Good morning. Just on the funding side here, recognizing that you're now focused on growing core deposits. In the meantime, as your CDs and borrowings roll-off, is there a preference between one or the other?
Thomas Cangemi: A combination of both, sure. I mean, we have $10.5 billion rolling-off in 12 months at 79 basis points. This quarter, we have $4 billion at 1.07%, markets between 40 and 50 basis points in the retail platform, some of the customers are not going to go into a CD instrument, they may just hide the money market account at two basis points or two to 10 basis points. So we'd rather have them go to the lowest cost of funds and assuming that we're not in a rising rate environment on the short end, they'll hide there for a while and there may be opportunistic if they want to take an 18 month CD or a one-year CD but the cost versus the wholesale market is pretty much on top of each other. So either -- we'd rather bring in obviously customer accounts for sure. But if you saw the transition of the deposit base that where CDs went into money market and other hybrid funds that are viewed more as an operating type account, so lower cost, right.
Steven Duong: Yes. And how much in borrowings is rolling-off this quarter?
Thomas Cangemi: We have $325 million rolling-off at a 236 coupon. And then next quarter, I believe we have 393 basis points, very small in Q3 about $25 million in the fourth quarter of the year so decent sized amount of 373 at 2.57%. But on average for the year, it's about a $1 billion at 2.03%.
Steven Duong: Got it, got it. Appreciate that. And then just, your strategy on the core deposit growth in the long-term, I guess, how are you thinking about doing that, with the brokers on the origination side?
Thomas Cangemi: We've already had conversations. I'm not going to -- we’re not going to announce a secret sauce of that. But we have great relationships with our brokers. And, historically was about process. Now we're going to change the process internally, it's a matter of getting ahead at the closings. Now, we took before with a lot of volume our loan docs require, we require the operating accounts and the loan docs. So you waive a lot less you do and you get them to the table and you get the relationship guys in front of the customers at the closing table. When they want their $50 million to $100 million, they've to open up the account and get the relationship going instead of waiving it. So it's about repositioning and dealing with process and people. And that's the goal here. And that's fine-tuning a loan will probably move the needle at the same time, we need to get this technology build-out that we've invested in out to the customers see what we have and that's going to help.
Steven Duong: And was it the case before that you weren't able to do that because you didn't have the capabilities and now that you do?
Thomas Cangemi: No, no, absolutely not. I would say it's two-fold, right? We just did the biggest conversion of the bank in August in the middle of the pandemic, under the Fiserv D&A's core processing system. We've had partnered with Fiserv throughout the entire platform for all our major systems that plug into Fiserv. So we have a low score, saw the very strong partnership with Fiserv. We co-collaborated on the commercial side as well. So the commercial cash flow management solutions program that we have is a Fiserv product. It's a Fiserv product that's used throughout the entire country. And that was not the same product that was there in July. So this is a fairly new opportunity that we believe is not an excuse that our system is not compatible. So I think we have a very good solution. And when I will get, there's a push. And by the way, this is only since August, right? So we're just starting the year. It's not even a year old, but we have the solution. And now it's a matter of getting the customers on board, onboarding them, training them, and focusing on the push at the top level, this is at the board level all the way down to the staff. This is where we should be going with the franchise getting away from the traditional thrift funding.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Breese with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Breese: I don't think I saw in the release, just curious what was the criticized and classified loan balances this quarter versus last?
Thomas Cangemi: I think we -- we disclosed that, John. I'll just give -- I'll go to the substandard we had, I think I went through that in detail. We had a total of $449 million substandard in multifamily. And we had a total of CRE at $314 million of which I believe identified 80% being the Manhattan market, I think I went through the LTVs. But I'll go through them again. The LTVs on that book is about 56% for multi and 58% for CRE. And as I discussed, looking at that portfolio, a lot of these -- most of these customers still when we put some of these customers in a IO structure for six months, most of them one for one of capacity to continue making these payments. We will reevaluate them as we get into the April, May period when that six month roll comes due and see where they're at and we're working with them. And clearly, like I said, Manhattan is the area of focus because we see more of these loans coming out of the Manhattan markets, not so much the other boroughs.
Matthew Breese: Got it. Okay, so it's a six month structure as well.
Thomas Cangemi: Yes, six month IO, yes, and then also all the taxes as well.
Matthew Breese: They're all paying us.
Thomas Cangemi: They're all paying us. That's right.
Matthew Breese: One thing you'd mentioned, I just wanted a little bit more color on explanation. You mentioned the 2022 hedge the potential for that to roll-off. Can you just remind me, what that was, why it was put on the size and how does it benefit them in by 12 bps?
Thomas Cangemi: Yes, it was a $2 billion total notional hedge that we did that swapped from fixed to floating on our -- against our loan portfolio and last layer hedge. So it was a three-year swap that we did, so that matures in February of 2022. So if we do not reup or get into another transaction like that, we will see those loans which are right now in essence pricing off a three-month LIBOR go back to their fixed rate on our books. So you'll see a big pick up on that $2 billion back to the normal fixed rate of those loans.
John Pinto: That would categorize as an intraday risk hedge?
Thomas Cangemi: Right.
Matthew Breese: All right, thank you. And then the last one for me, just in regards to expenses, I hear you loud and clear. I just wanted to make sure the message was that in terms of new hires, or going into new verticals, you feel like what you have in place, the $535 million in annual expenses. That's a good -- that's a good run rate. And that you feel like the NIE to add to ratio sub 1% is a place that you can go, that's something you may do?
Thomas Cangemi: I think it's a fair estimate where we are today, I feel comfortable with those numbers. I mean, obviously, we're elevated on FDIC we strive for a very strong efficiency ratio. I think we met our goals last year on efficiency ratio, despite the slight uptick. And we've identified what they were, we had the FDIC cost, we had some medallion related expenses, as we took in some REO pieces on the medallion side. But going forward, bringing in some customer service people, it's not going to move the needle, reallocating resources internally towards the context of the push towards pull relationship lending is  we're not going to change the game somehow, this is not going to happen, where we're going to change the product mix, the product mix will change as we pick partners, right. But the low lying fruit will be harvested here. And we're going to work very hard in harvesting with the relationship with the brokers, the lenders, as well as our deposit gathers together as a team. And we're going to work as a team to try to harvest that low lying fruit that we've always talked about. But now we're going to put it into action. And I think the system really helps us did that systems conversion was extremely key for us. And I'm going to reemphasize a lot of our competitors that I want to work on in serious system with the same vendor are going to reup down the road. So doing it through, will join the family makes a lot more sense.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Marinac: Hey, thanks for taking my question Tom and John. I just wanted to ask about the deposit specialists that Tom you alluded to, would these be possible hires in other markets besides New York? And is that a strategy to kind of assess them well in this individually kind of stack up a team?
Thomas Cangemi: Absolutely. Ohio, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Long Island, we're going to be very proactive to try to create value here by looking at these opportunities, and no question that these people are portable. And we've seen it happen in our backyard, and most of our competitors are very successful at it. We're going to give it a shot as well. But it's not going to be a major restructuring expense growth; it's going to be done in a methodical way. And I think we have to just utilize the platform and the system. And ultimately, the true change will come when we paint the canvas with new products. And that will be full service commercial banking type products over time, typically through a partnership. And like I indicated, I think we've spent the effort on the conversion, we've spent the effort on getting our cash flow management systems solutions correct. Now, it's a matter of looking at what we have with the current existing relationships, working with the brokers, working with the customer base, and perhaps changing some of the type of products within typical opportunities within a customer's book of business. We've always done multifamily and CREs, no reason why we can't do lines of credit for these wealthy customers that want that. And that's why they're banking with another bank, and we don't have all the deposits. So we have to be mindful of that, it's opportunistic, that's not a difficult change for our system to run those types of products. Like I said, we're not going to do a residential loan book from scratch, right; we're not going to open up a credit card business from scratch. But if we have a unique opportunity within the M&A the marketplace where people can bring partnerships to the table, we would evaluate that. And then hopefully have a full service branch platform, right now it's a very thrift like which over time. I'm going to make a statement and people may not want to hear this. But you think about the traditional thrift model, I've never seen a thrift convert themselves organically doing it successful, it has to be done through traditional M&A transactions that makes sense on a partnership perspective. And I will never call it acquisitions because acquisitions are difficult, partnerships work, acquisitions could be challenging when you partner with the right partner, that's willing to put their expertise on the table and their wealth on the table. Everyone has common goals.
