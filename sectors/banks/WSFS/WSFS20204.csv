"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the WSFS Financial Corporation Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder today’s conference call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to your host for today Mr. Dominic Canuso, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.
Dominic Canuso: Thank you, Dorie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to participate on our call today.
Rodger Levenson: Thanks, Dominic, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Consistent with our recent practice, we will use the introductory section of this call to provide both a brief commentary on fourth quarter results, as well as our outlook on 2021. WSFS had a very solid fourth quarter, reporting earnings per share of $1.20, return on assets of 1.73%, and return on tangible common equity of 19.37%. As detailed in the release and earnings supplement, core results were very close to the reported numbers after incorporating a nominal amount of non-core items. Core PPNR of $73.4 million represented an 8% increase over the prior quarter and translated into a very healthy 2.12% of assets. These results included the impact of interest income and fee accretion from PPP, as approximately 22% of PPP loans had been forgiven by year-end. It also included modestly higher purchase loan accretion in conjunction with the continued accelerated run-off of the non-relationship portfolios primarily acquired from beneficial. Combined with a stable base margin, this translated into a net interest margin of 3.93%. Excluding the expected reduction in mortgage banking activity, fee income grew 5% versus the third quarter with contributions from across multiple business lines. Expenses continued to be well managed even as we continue to make significant investments in our franchise. This includes the multiyear delivery transformation project, and continued talent acquisition including a total of nine relationship managers, who have joined WSFS over the past 12 months.
Dominic Canuso: Thank you, Rodger. Good afternoon, everyone and Happy New Year. As Rodger mentioned, we look toward 2021 with continued momentum and the organic opportunities ahead while managing through the expectations of a slow and uneven economic recovery and COVID-19 cessation. 2021 results will be impacted by the pace of the economic recovery, the timing of forgiveness of PPP loans, new PPP loan, and the resulting effects of historically high liquidity positions. With that said, today we will share our outlook for underlying business performance expectations that will drive our financial performance in 2021. We have provided a summary of our outlook on Slide 5 in the 4Q earnings supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our company website. Our loan growth outlook is for mid-single digits when excluding both PPP and non-relationship run-off portfolios. Growth will primarily be driven by C&I, leasing and consumer loans. We anticipate approximately 90% of original PPP volume will be forgiven by year-end. For new PPP loans, we are partnering with a leading technology partner to support our customers and acquire new relationships. While new PPP loans will not be originated on our balance sheet, resulting deposits from these loans would be. In addition, we anticipate approximately $200 million or 20% purposeful attrition in the runoff non-relationship portfolios. Deposit growth is expected in the mid-single digits, driven by existing customer loyalty and continued market share growth.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Frank Schiraldi of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Frank Schiraldi: So just a couple of, first, I wondered Dominic, if you could talk a little bit more about the NIM mechanics for next year. And specifically, you talk about the slightly less an excess liquidity and continued reduction in deposit rates. I know originally, when you did the beneficial deal, the idea was, the loan replacement rates as you switch from non-relationship to relationship commercial would create increased loan yields overall. Is that still the case and it doesn't, wouldn't seem to be given what your margin expectations are in next year?
Dominic Canuso: Sure, thanks Frank. Yes, clearly as shown on Slide 6 of our supplement, there's a lot of moving parts with regard to NIM, as we exit 2020 into 2021. We do see the continued improvement in customer deposits, as I mentioned. So that will improve what we call that that basic NIM in the range of 335 to 342 next year. To your question regarding portfolio migration, as we focus on continuing to grow the portfolio and improve the mix towards relationship based higher yielding C&I that continues to be true. The challenge in this environment is that loans that are paying off at are a higher rate than loans being booked. And so that's skewing in the short-term, that migration benefit, but as rates stabilize and in fact improve, you would see that more prevalent in our base NIM going forward.
Frank Schiraldi: Okay, so with the rate picture as it is, which of course you point out, that's the outlook for 2021. The replacement rates setting aside PPP, the replacement rates on the loan book, as you mix shift will continue to eat away at yields? Is that fair?
Dominic Canuso: That is correct, it would continue to put pressure on the base NIM, but that would be offset by improved customer funding cost and the portfolio migration.
Frank Schiraldi: Right, okay. And then, in terms of the problem, total problem loans have been pretty stable. And obviously, the COVID modifications continued to fall. Just wondering how do you see, do you think that those classified, criticized balances do you assume that they'll be fairly flat for the next few quarters until you get better - a better outlook on the economic side or do you start to see that all as we start to see charge offs pick up? Just wondering how and timing of what we should look for? And how you see those balances playing out directionally over the next few quarters?
Rodger Levenson: Sure, I'll pass it off to Steve Clark to talk a little bit about what he's seeing in regard to specific customers and working with those relationships. And then I can speak a bit to how we're thinking about those trends with regard to CECL on the provision?
Steve Clark: Frank, this is Steve. I would just say that, as we've spoken in past quarters, we really have completed our review of risk ratings. And the migration was minimal in the fourth quarter, kind of consistent with our expectations. We continue on a quarterly basis to review all of our risk ratings. So certainly any improvement or deterioration will be depending upon the economy and the recovery and the vaccine, but right now we’ve think we’ve taken an appropriately conservative approach and feel like we really have a good handle on our current risk ratings.
Rodger Levenson: And Frank, just to kind of share thoughts around how CECL considers this, as we've laid out on Slide 8 in our materials of the $229 million of ACL that we have currently, around $100 million or 44% of it is related to economic forecasts impact. So that would presume that the economic factors would put pressure on some of those metrics, and those have been reserved against, but as Steve mentioned, we've gone through the significant reviews, and now it's just based on quarterly performance.
Frank Schiraldi: Okay. And then just a quick one on comp, I think you had said that the fourth quarter was impacted by incentive comp and just wondering, as it pertains to modeling for next year, what a reasonable run rate would be for the comp line?
Steve Clark: Sure, well as I mentioned, our compensation and salaries would continue to increase as we've made strategic investments to add to our associate base, particularly on the lending side, and through relationship managers. When we plan we presume we will hit target, and that would be more. Therefore, our incentive compensation metrics on a normal - more normalized basis hopefully, that helps to answer your question.
Frank Schiraldi: So you do think that the comp will migrate higher from - if I just compare 4Q to the run rate beginning next year that's a decent place to start. And then to your point, you continue to invest in new lenders?
Steve Clark: That's correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Perito of KBW. Your line is open.
Michael Perito: Couple of things Rodger, I was wondering if maybe just to start here, before we ask a little bit about the model. Obviously 2020 was not the year I imagine you guys expected or planned for and I was just curious, how do you - where should we think about you guys kind of from here in terms of, I know, you guys typically lay out a multiyear internal strategic plan. And I mean, can you maybe just give us an update about how you're thinking about that process?
Rodger Levenson: Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. It is something that the management team and the Board have been spending time on over the last several months. As you recall, this is the final year of the current strategic plan. And obviously, the middle year was certainly impacted by the whole COVID situation. So as we move through this year as has been our historical practice, we will update that with a new three year strategic plan. Obviously, the financial metrics for this year are impacted by the significant rate and credit environment changes with CECL, that weren't contemplated as original financial metrics. But the overall strategy has not changed. And then as we move through this year, we'll be working on that strategic plan. And we'll present an updated three year plan, when we get to the end of next year. I would say overall though Mike, the takeaway I would want everybody to come away with is that everything that has occurred this year for us just confirms the strategic rationale of the combination with beneficial and the very large opportunity, we see that that presented to us. We got interrupted, but we've continued to invest, heavily as we've talked about with RMs and other things. And we feel very optimistic about our growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond.
Michael Perito: And can you remind us how you guys think about kind of core capital, I think couple of quarters ago you mentioned something about it in the slide deck, but after that - after this - after fourth quarter with share repurchases, there actually seems like there might be some line of sight depending on your activity in the next quarter to kind of get into a more normalized capital basis than the levels you were outpost beneficial? Just can you remind us how you think about the capital levels at a more normalized level for this balance sheet at this time?
Rodger Levenson: Yes, so we've talked about as we've laid out the impact of the reserve build and the capital buffers that we have. We remain over our internal bank and holding company capital level targets. And we like to have a buffer above that, obviously the buyback program in the fourth quarter, significantly reduced those buffers, but we still have our ways to go. And there's a lot of things that go into the mix there. In terms of as Dominic outlined, what we see is potential opportunities to invest in the business, what's going on with the credit, whether it's, good things like reserve or leases or future challenges, and then just the overall economic environment. So we're closer to those levels than we were, before with what occurred in the in the fourth quarter, but there's still some more excess capital for us to deploy within the construct of all those dynamics.
Michael Perito: Great, helpful thank you. And then just two modeling questions for Dominic one, just the non-interest income, outlook commentary, does that I think all inclusive, flat year-on-year, is – that based around approximately $169 million kind of core fee number for 2020 or is there other adjustments to that, that we should be thinking of when you guys lay that out?
Dominic Canuso: No, I think the number you just mentioned is in the ballpark of growth, I think, the two significant impacts that are in play is first the full year impact of Durban. And then clearly what may happen with mortgage banking and the volumes, and particularly in the refi space and secondary market rates, as mortgage bank has been around mid to high teens of our total fee income, and clearly then would have an impact. So we've stripped those two out to provide an outlook on the remaining fee trends.
Michael Perito: And then as I think about the balance sheet mix, and obviously there still be quite a bit of runoff in 2021, as you guys laid out, but – any initial thoughts I mean I realized we're moving out a little bit here. But and I'm just kind of piggybacks on the earlier question. But as we get into 2022 I mean, do you kind of see that, assuming the rate environments, pretty similar? I mean, do you kind of see that becoming the year where some of the remixing will take hold in the margin, in terms of kind of getting out of some of the stuff you're running off? And reshuffling into the commercial lending that you guys are targeting. But do you think that that's a probability that, the kind of impact in the margin will be more at least noticeable in 2022 as you see it today or is there any other dynamics we should be thinking about?
Dominic Canuso: Yes, I think it's a great question. And first and foremost, is the balance sheet migration is occurring today, it's just difficult to see in this interest rate environment. So with – a stable rate environment for a period of time, and then or rising rates, you'll see the expansion of the NIM based on those relationship based spreads that we have in the marketplace. And then it would continue to accelerate from there, particularly as we focus on the C&I and even some of our leasing growth that we see with high single-digits, low double-digit yields from that portfolio as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Zwick of Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is open.
Erik Zwick: If I could just starting with the loan growth and curious where the pipeline sits today versus maybe three months ago? And have you seen any improvement in that over the past month or two, since we've gotten some progress on vaccine approval and distribution or what may drive that to help support – the outlook that you've talked about previously?
Rodger Levenson: Sure, Steve, do you want to handle that question?
Steve Clark: Yes, sure hi Erik. So the commercial pipeline, we look at like a 90-day weighted average is up from where it was a quarter ago. It's about $215 million and that's kind of our forecast of what we expect to close and fund over that period of time on a weighted average basis. The pipeline had gotten as low as 175, 165 going back a quarter or two. So, we certainly see increased activity. For us it's really market share opportunities, related to impart on new relationship managers that have joined us and in part to some of the disruption we're seeing at some of their bigger bank competitors. So it's really not related to economic growth, it is really related to market share opportunities.
Erik Zwick: Thanks, I appreciate the color there. And then just thinking about, any particular industries that are driving that, and then also just as the bank has grown larger over the past few years, are you starting to have some success moving up in terms of customer size? And is that presenting more opportunities as well?
Rodger Levenson: So I think there is no specific industry in the C&I space. We are generalists, and we look at all industries across the board. In the CRE side, we continue to see nice opportunities in multifamily space and residential, land and residential vertical development. So those segments continue to be to be active. And I apologize I forgot the second half of your question.
Erik Zwick: Just in terms of our customer size and loan size, have you had success, kind of, moving up market now that the balance sheet is larger?
Rodger Levenson: Yes, so we're not focused on moving up market per se, our core business is privately held companies, with revenues in the commercial bank, ranging from $3 million to $5 million up to about $150 million, that is our market. We really don't view us as going above that we really think that space privately held companies give us the best opportunity to really deliver all of our products and services across the bank.
Erik Zwick: And then switch to gears a little bit in terms of the delivery transformation. As you look at 2021, are there any particular areas of the organizations or businesses lines that are targeted for investment this year? And what specific kind of products or systems are you looking to invest in?
Dominic Canuso: Sure, thanks Erik, this is Dominic. And I would just remind everyone that, as we've said, this is delivery transformation initiative. These aren’t just a few projects, but significant investment across the board, including customer facing risk modules, and – back office efficiency. So it's really across the board and they're intended to provide value across the entire organizations, including the implementation of a CRM tool, specifically sales force across the bank this year. Enhancements and  for customer facing speed to market and tying that into CRM, some other infrastructure capabilities like something like mute deal soft to ensure our technology stack is compatible across all these types of investments, next generation sales and service for on-boarding and support both our retail customers and in the branch online, on the phone, and even small business. So it's really a significant investment across all our platforms to really drive growth and efficiency going forward.
Erik Zwick: Thanks, Dominic. And then I just kind of changing gears again to asset quality and the $15 million multifamily commercial rate relationship that moved to non-accrual that was noted in the press release. Any kind of specific you can provide there was that one specific project or is that the total relationship and what is the plan to kind of manage that at this point?
Steve Clark: Erik, this is Steve again. So that particular relationship, it is one CRE relationship consisting of two loans, that total $15 million and the properties are actually multifamily student housing, located in a very desirable section of Philadelphia. So the loans were originally underwritten at 65% loan to value and the properties are currently 80% occupied. So, we are working with the borrower and we certainly expect this situation to be resolved favorably.
Erik Zwick: Thanks, Steve. And just one last one from me and then I'll drop off. You talked a lot about capital already and feeling there is a good use for deploying capital into share repurchases. You didn't increase the common dividend in 2020. What would prompt you to potentially do that in '21 or in the years ahead?
Dominic Canuso: Sure Erik, this is Dominic. So just to restate our long stated practice with regard to capital deployment is first looking at our core earnings and typically returning 25% of our core earnings split equally between routine share buybacks, regardless of price and then a purposely low dividend. And then to the extent as we've seen recently is given excess capacity and capital and positive share price to redeploy that through incremental share repurchases. Clearly, this is a unique environment and we would want to see the sustainable earnings that we anticipate coming out of 2020 to 2021. And then we'd love to maintain those relationships of returning 25% of that core capital between the share buyback and the dividend moving forward as we had in the five years leading up to 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from Russell Gunther with Davidson. Your line is open.
Russell Gunther: I just have a few follow-ups. First, with regard to the fee income conversation, you guys mentioned the double-digit in wealth management for '21. Are you able to share any colors to the fundamentals behind that would support that growth rate?
Rodger Levenson: Art, do you want to take that question?
Arthur Bacci: Sure. Good afternoon, Russell. Our institutional trust businesses grown double-digit for the last eight years. And right now, I can tell you that January typically is a slower month after the rush to securitize at the end of the year, but this January continues to be fairly active with tax law changes proposed potentially out there and gifting rules potentially changing and there is still very active personal trust activity, and we saw a 13% increase in account openings at the end of the year. So that bodes well for fee income going into 2021, as well as we ended the year with - on the advisory side, the AUM was at a record high for us in the market at the end of the year or anyone was up 7% from third quarter. So since we build in arrears, we've got 7% first quarter fee income growth just based on the market, and then you add on hopefully some good net client inflows, and I feel pretty confident that double-digit is achievable.
Russell Gunther: I appreciate the color there. And switching gears a bit, Dominic, I think I heard you say 200 million is the targeted run-off portfolio shrinkage for this year. And if I heard that, right, it's a bit of a deceleration from a more recent clip, so just curious as to what's driving that assumption?
Dominic Canuso: Sure, I think it would be relatively consistent trends as we've seen in that run off residential mortgage portfolio. But some of the other categories, the participation portfolios and leveraged loans had chunkier, larger loans that had either refinanced or paid off over the last few years that will not reoccur. So when you take the blended portfolio as it stands today, we'd like to see somewhat of a lower run rate than we've seen in the last few years. Again, though that's contingent upon, I think a significant portion to what will happen with the residential mortgage market.
Russell Gunther: And then within the provision guidance, are you guys able to share a range and sort of timing and magnitude of what that contemplates for realized losses and net charge offs?
Arthur Bacci: So we don't share that level of detail what we can say. And clearly you've seen in our credit metrics, that performance continues to be relatively stable, I think there is still a lot in play with regard to the pace of the economic recovery what we have seen in the last few quarters is that the major forecasts for GDP and unemployment are stable to slightly improving. So that's helping. But ultimately, what needs to be understood is the extent to which PPP and government stimulus are either pushing out the lost content or otherwise mitigating it. And I think we have a couple of quarters to go here to fully understand that.
Russell Gunther: And then last question. We're back to capital deployment, the three year strategic plan was mentioned. And I believe the one that we're currently in at some point articulated remaining on the sidelines from a depository M&A perspective, is that still the case or are there opportunities that may present themselves where WSFS would be willing to announce a depository deal in 2021?
Rodger Levenson: Yes, so this is Rodger, I'll jump in on that Russell. So, as we said a number of times, the strategic plan and our focus has been on this, what we think is just an incredible organic growth opportunity in this Greater Philadelphia Delaware region is being the only locally headquartered Bank of size and scale to compete with the big guys. It's very unique market position. So we are very focused on that, we keep our eyes open for other things. But it really would have to be something that would be consistent with a strategic plan and additive to that objective in terms of our current market position for us to pick our heads up and turn away from the organic growth opportunities.
Russell Gunther: Understood, okay, great. Rodger, Dominic, everybody thanks for taking my questions. That's it for me.
Rodger Levenson: Thanks Russell.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Brody Preston of Stephens Inc. Your line is open.
Brody Preston: I just want to circle back on a couple of the fee income businesses, Dominic, and just on Cash Connect. You all done a pretty good job just in terms of the unit growth there in terms of the ATMs, and particularly on the smart safe side of the business. But net revenue trends in relatively flattish from 3Q to 4Q. How should we be thinking about the revenue growth trajectory of that business in 2021, especially now that interest rates definitely found the bottom?
Rodger Levenson: Sure, good question. So, yes, we continue to see top line opportunity, particularly with regard to units and total cash service. In particular, we're seeing outsized growth continue in our smart safe and reconciliation products, which bring higher yielding returns to the division and to the bank. Year-over-year though clearly the impacts of COVID and the lower interest rates will have somewhat of an impact. So there will be muted year-over-year growth in net revenues, but a lot of that is managed also in our expense base and some improvements being made in the scalability of the business. So while net revenues in particular, fee revenue will necessarily see meaningful growth year-over-year again, because of the full year impact of the interest rate environment and COVID we do anticipate to see continued bottom line growth and to see ROAs consistent with 2020.
Brody Preston: Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the wealth side of the business, obviously continued strong growth there. And I appreciate some of the guidance. And I just wanted to ask about one of the hires you made earlier in the summer, Salvatore coming over from PNC, as he gotten up to speed the ad, or is it as part of your guide for double-digit growth part of him continuing to build his business and bring over some of his old book?
Rodger Levenson: Steve, do you want to start with just onboarding and what you see in the future, and I think there is a tremendous overlap with Art so maybe you can share his thoughts as well.
Steve Clark: Yes. So as it relates to Sal Patti, he joined us in August of last year. And after 23 or so years at a competitor bank, the last three or so of those years, he ran the wealth business for that bank, but prior to that, and all of his career prior, he was really in the commercial lending, commercial banking space. So his activity while he has kind of a foot in both commercial and wealth, his activity really has been focused so far on commercial opportunities. And I don't want to speak for Art, but I don't believe any production that may be generated by Sal, is in wealth forecast.
Arthur Bacci: Brody, this is Art. We do work closely with Sal, I do think there'll be some benefit to the wealth team from Sal. I think one of the nice things I'm seeing is just the coordination and the communication, the teamwork that's really going well between the commercial RM and the wealth team. And it's really generated a very nice strong pipeline coming into 2021. And we like commercial has spent a good portion of the fourth quarter talking to private bankers and advisors and the amount of the year end has passed, we probably will restart some of those conversations. But I think in general, and we have the opportunity to continue to invest in talent and the wealth. And with the coming together with commercial and being able to go to clients with a offering that's both for their business and for them personally, I think it's going to be a great opportunity for us.
Brody Preston: Okay, thank you for that. And then one of the - I guess the highlights of the beneficial deal was the ability to cross-sell some of the fee income line items that you have that beneficial didn't necessarily have and part of that was mortgage. Now, obviously, you and others have had a great year there. But I wanted to ask, were you able to sort of penetrate that market and cross-sell into beneficial customers? And I guess maybe the low rate environment helped pull that through? Or is there still more wood to chop there where you could better penetrate I guess, beneficial customer base and help mortgage out a little bit more in 2021 to a greater degree than maybe some of your peers have the ability to do?
Dominic Canuso: Sure, Brody, this is Dominic. Yes, there is a tremendous opportunity ahead both from not only cross-selling to existing and legacy beneficial customers, who did not have those products or to them ad beneficial, but across our expanded footprint due to that combination in the Greater Philadelphia markets in New Jersey, South Jersey, and Southeastern Pennsylvania and Delaware. And so while 2020 was disruptive in the interest rate environment was a bit challenging, I think what we saw in mortgage was an example of the opportunities that exist. With that significant growth in that business, both in originations and loans closed and an overall volume and customer service. We still see the opportunity, whether its credit cards, small business, SBA, private banking, et cetera, a tremendous opportunity ahead. We're still very focused on that. We had made significant investments in staffing and capabilities in 2019 and 2020 to take advantage of those opportunities, and we were prepared if you recall, right when COVID hit was our one year anniversary of the close of the combination and the six month anniversary of the conversion. So we were very focused on executing on those business cases and strategies. And COVID did disrupt that for a couple of quarters here. But if anything, what we've learned so far is the opportunities ahead or are as big if not bigger than what we anticipated from the combination.
Arthur Bacci: Dominic, this is Art if I may. We added four advisors at the end of 2019 in anticipation of being able to work with the beneficial branch that were clearly COVID with the shutdown of the branches or restricting access to the branches impacted that but we continue to do outreach and email. And we've really seen the benefit of that, as the branches opened up in the second half of the year with Investment Group, AUM grew well, well into the double digits, as we saw the relationships with the beneficial branches really start to kick in. So I'm really hopeful that, we continue that momentum to 2021.
Brody Preston: And then last one for me, Dominic, I'm sorry, if you covered it already. But the margin guidance seems to imply less of a liquidity drag in 2021 then what happened in the fourth quarter? And so should the expectation be for you to deploy, some of the excess liquidity that you got this quarter into - further into securities balances or does it earmarked for obviously be better for loan growth, but just wanted to get a sense for what the plan is for the excess liquidity moving forward?
Dominic Canuso: Sure, yes and even in 2020, we increased the size of our investment portfolio about 20% year-over-year, and we'd see continued opportunities to do that to leverage this excess liquidity in a disciplined and appropriate manner. So that's where we would deploy it and put it to work clearly the pace of recovery, customer behaviors and spending with those deposits. And incremental deposits that would result from the second round of PPP would put pressure on the NIM rate, but obviously be accretive on an earnings perspective.
Operator: Thank you. I’m showing no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Rodger Levenson for any closing remarks.
Rodger Levenson: I just would like to say thanks for everybody for joining us on the call today. Dominic and I will be virtually out on the road in the coming weeks and look forward to connecting with many of you at that time. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for participating, you may all disconnect. Have a great day."
