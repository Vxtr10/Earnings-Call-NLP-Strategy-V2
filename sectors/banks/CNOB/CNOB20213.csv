Frank Sorrentino: Thank you, Siya, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining us today. I am very pleased to report a strong quarter and extremely proud of the year to date performance of our team. We leverage the momentum in the first half of the year, demonstrating our ability to continue to execute and driving the strongest financial performance metrics in the company's history. Some highlights for the quarter include a return on assets of 1.62 and a return on tangible common equity of 16.9. Our pre-provision net revenue increased once again to 2.23% of average assets and our quarterly sequential annualized loan growth net of PPP was 21%. None of this is surprising for ConnectOne. We saw early on an opportunity in the rebounding New York Metro economy for banks like ours to take a proactive approach to the recovery. Our teams were prepared and we leveraged our technological investments to drive growth. We also moved quickly realizing market opportunities to add additional revenue generating talent and those efforts will support our outlook heading into the new year. Loan growth accelerated for a second quarter in a row, a result of our strategic focus on our areas of expertise, coupled with our prudent adherence to strong credit standards and spread disciplines. All of this led to our margin expanding for the eighth consecutive quarter. Meanwhile, in August we raised an excess of a $100 million in non-cumulative preferred stock, increasing our flexibility in the deployment of our capital. And with that today's we announced the number of capital actions. First, based on our board's continued confidence in ConnectOne's performance, we raised our quarterly cash dividend for the second time. this year to $0.13, that's up 18% from the last quarter and up 44% from a year ago. Second, the board authorized an increase to our repurchase program by two million shares or 5% of the outstanding shares. We're also pleased to see positive momentum in our non-interest revenue sources and these include our SBA platform where we expanded our talent, allowing us to further grow this business line. The origination or originating portfolios of commercial real estate loans held to sale has continued to accelerate, reflecting our discipline lending philosophy while generating additional non-interest income. And lastly, BoeFly, our FinTech subsidiary continues to build momentum as it realizes the benefits of the investments we made. We generating more traffic through proprietary product we verify and the patented equal. We also continue to scale and extend their competitive position amongst franchisors while continuing to support the banks who benefit from the loan marketplace. We look forward to further grow, both horizontally and vertically from both line. The disruption in the M&A market -- in our markets continues to present numerous opportunities, which we're taking advantage of. We're attracting high performing talent, who are seeking us out to the opportunity to join a growth oriented, client focused culture with a proven ability to execute. Toward that end, we've enhanced our competitive position within New York with the recent addition of a seasoned lending team in Eastern Long Island. This allows us to further extend our reach and capability while positioning -- while strengthening our position as a New York Metro bank. We're also excited to provide some details regarding the addition of a banking team in South Florida. This is a natural progression for ConnectOne's relationship focused model, allowing us to further support our New York Metro based clients who already have a presence in this market. Additionally, the commercial and small business community in South Florida is very dynamic and we're seeing meaningful opportunities to couple our team's local expertise with the ConnectOne model to this growing marketplace. We plan to open our permanent office there in the early part of 2022. And look forward to sharing that update along with the progress of our team in the coming months. By the way, anyone interested in joining the ConnectOne team, we're still hiring in all of our markets. So come join us. So as expected expenses were up sequentially, reflecting our recognition in our best in class team, the addition of new talent and the continued investments in our infrastructure and technology. And I'd like to reinforce that our industry leading efficiency ratio is a direct indicator of our ability to enhance revenue growth while continuously building our operational capabilities. In other words, bringing in more revenue supports more in the area, such as operations, credit, BSA, and compliance. I just wanted to reiterate, this is an exciting time for ConnectOne and I'm pleased with the ground that we're laying for our long term success. I'll now turn it over to Bill to provide a little more detail on this quarter's financial performance. Bill?
Bill Burns: Okay. Thank you, Frank and good morning everyone. It was another great quarter for ConnectOne and I am happy to report that we are finally getting some recognition in terms of stock price performance stock prices up recent about 10% more than our peers, but I still believe we're undervalued. I base that view on our current earnings, our expected growth rate and our strategic plans to capitalize on the, this evolving financial services industry. And as you saw in today's release, we announced a couple of capital actions. First, we raised our dividend again the second this year by another $0.02. Naturally this reflects the board's confidence in our future earnings, but also reflects the fact that our dividend pay ratio is very low and a bit out of step with the peer group. And even with this increase, the pay ratio is below 20%. So there is room for more increases in the future. Now we are aware of the differing views out there, our dividends, but all things considered. We think this move makes sense, given our strong profitability and high return on tangible common equity. Secondly, our board just upped our stock. We purchased authority by two million shares or about 5% of outstanding shares. The non-cumulative preferred we just issued in August gave us added flexibility to establish a purchase plan. Capital ratios are strong and the target levels there are based on a host of factors. Those include growth earnings estimates as well as considerations for risk, but we presently have a cushion going forward. We're going to take into consideration these factors as well as our valuation on any given day, but bottom line, we stand ready to be aggressive when the timing is right. So now in terms of our core profitability for the quarter, as Frank was talking to our PPN, R increased significantly both sequentially by 7%. And from a year ago, by 17% to 2.2%, 3% of assets, that's a very, very strong metric, I was happy when we were over 2%, five quarters ago, and since then we've increased that metric every quarter. The main driver of the increase this time was then interest income growth, which we achieved through a combination of strong loan originations and margin expansion, average loans, growth, and annualized rate of 13%, which includes the negative impact of PPP forgiveness. So if you exclude the PPP our loan portfolio grow an annualized rate in excess of 20%, and then our margin, it widened by more than 10 basis points to 3.73%. And let give you some color there. You, we continue to see improvement in both our cost of funds and deposit mix. As CDs repriced, we continue to grow core deposits. Meanwhile, the match funded spread originations remains favorable, I'd say above 3%. However, the margin for the quarter was aid by two non-core items. One was an acceleration of PPP fee accretion due as unexpected forgiveness that added about an extra 1 million to the quarter's net interest income. And the other was the recovery of back interest. We collected upon the resolution of a non accrual loan. That was another 600,000 want to make one more point on the PPP. I think there is a misconception that PPP is adding to margin on a recurring basis. P PPP loan yields typically average below 3 25 per quarter, as they run off, we more than make up for it with new originations. What happened this quarter is we needed to accelerate the creation of fees, which temporally increased the yield on this small portfolio for the quarter. So without those items, I just mentioned the core margin was still wider, but probably just a few days basis points, not the 10 basis points on a gap basis. Let me get some color on non-interest income. The non-interest income line was down slightly sequentially as the second quarter concluded some non-recurring PPP referral income coming out of Boly. However, the underlying trend for our noninterest income was positive across the board. Frank mentioned this as well. Our SBA lending initiative continues to accelerate CRA loan sales continue to hold pace. And the outlook is for continued momentum. We have more and more small banks lacking the original capability of ConnectOne. And at both fly, we are seeing accelerating traffic and traction increased core revenues from that platform. Let me turn to OPEX for the quarter. Our efficiency ratio remained at a sub 40% level, and that was even with operating expenses increasing by 7% sequentially as was anticipated. As I alerted you to this on last quarter's earnings call most of the increase was related to the hiring along with experienced support staff. The staff count was up 5% from our quarter investment will support our continued organic growth and like others, we too are filling the effects of wage inflation, but whether or not wage inflation pressures continue, we will continue to reward our employees with superior individual performance. And we want them to share in the overall success of ConnectOne now, a little on credit metrics overall underlying credit quality remains strong. We did have a slight uptick in nauticals and TDRs that NCR increase was largely due to two isolated credits that we have deemed to be impaired, but they are not delinquent. They are current. And my expectation is by expectation is that the aggregate NCRs will decrease over the next couple of quarters. TDRs those increase as expected. And I did mention it last earnings call. These included a small handful of loans that were deferred under the cares act and are better served going forward with slightly relaxed terms. They are now performing under restructured terms and speaking of deferred loans, that total is now down to just 10 loans aggregating just 10 million, as far as loan loss provisioning. Many banks are still really leasing reserves while we have a small group adding, we had significant non PPP loan growth, and that was the driving factor for the very modest provision of 1 million for the quarter. Let me get into some guidance that I can feel comfortable giving you guys loan pipeline remains strong. So the fourth quarter is the likely to be similar to the past two quarters in terms of lung growth. I think it's a little early to project 2022, but, and I expect things to slow down a bit, but we still feel comfortable with approximately 10% growth, right next year, maybe a little more, maybe a little less the core margin this quarter was in the 360 to 365 range. And I spec some compression from that level. Maybe a few basis points per quarter in terms of expense growth. We might see just a modest uptick for the rest of this year. Not as big as the SCR increase we had this quarter next year could be more challenging. The labor markets are tight, there is wage inflation, but we will continue invest in our people technology and our overall infrastructure. So I definitely think a 40% efficiency ratio is certainly achievable hope we can do a little better than that. And then finally, just with regard to the tax rate a little bit higher than the street at estimated, just given the increased level of taxable income and our expected growth. I do see the tax rate increasing modestly over time. And before we get the questions, I'll turn it back over to Frank for closing comment.
Frank Sorrentino: Thanks Bill. We have a solid foundation and we're looking forward to building the next chapter of our company here. There's never been a more exciting time to be a ConnectOne. We're in a unique place because of the market in which we operate the position of our balance sheet for enhanced scale and the opportunities to utilize digital tools, to grow efficiently, our strong earnings power coupled with our enhanced capital as allows us to execute on a multitude of strategic initiatives. The potential for our FinTech subsidiary is exciting. As we see opportunity for growth across a number of verticals. And finally, we're a dynamic, highly valuable franchise, and we continue to explore financially attractive opportunities that could enhance our organic momentum on both the traditional bank side and in other financial services. So as you can see, we're very excited about our future we're pressing forward and, and expanding our client first model. And we remain confident in our ability to drive value for our shareholders, our team, and for our clients. And with that, we're happy to take your questions operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session.  Our first question is from Frank Schiraldi with Piper Sandler. Please proceed
Frank Schiraldi: I wanted to ask about the Florida team, and I just wanted, if you could share, what sort of balances you have on the books currently in that geography, and then Frank, I think you mentioned an office down there or opening an office down there. Is that, are you talking to full service branch or, or what are your longer term plans for that geography?
Frank Sorrentino: Sure Frank. Up to today, we have about a hundred million in footings in Florida that we've accumulated over the last couple of years as our clients have seen Florida as I like to call it the sixth far of New York. So and we see that building over time the team that we've hired there will occupy a, what we've been building for the last number of years here, which is a full service office, generally these are not retail type locations but they're more for the promotion of good business development officers, but we'll have full branch and deposit taking capability.
Frank Schiraldi: Okay. And as you see Florida has in terms of the rate of growth, better rate of growth than up here in the Northeast. So just wondering how you think percentage wise that could trend, and is there any interest in maybe acquiring something down there?
Frank Sorrentino: Hard for me to say at this point in time we are looking at that Florida market, and I think we'll continue to look at it more through the lens of what our clients are thinking here in New York Florida, because of the convenience of getting there. The favorable tax status has really attracted a lot of our top name developers and real estate folks and even other commercial business enterprises to open either off offices or put some capital into that marketplace. So we'll be following that. And I think that'll be leading the charge for us as to where we are, how big that gets and how much of that winds up here at ConnectOne while we're there. I think we also see there are opportunities to grow there, a number of interesting types of businesses and other opportunities within, in and around that same marketplace. And so, that growth could be accelerated a little bit by what we find once we're there, but I think it's going to be led mostly by, what the clients that we have and, through COVID, we've seen that a lot of our clients now are, I know we keep using these words, mobile, remote, whatever, but our clients are no longer geographically anchored. And so they're starting and capital starting to find its way into places in different ways. And I think we needed to think about that in the same way. And so we're pretty excited about the opportunity the bankers that we've been able to hire there were hired from organizations that resembled us that may have been acquired. And now those folks feel disenfranchised, working at much bigger organizations. And so being able to join the ConnectOne teams been a big plus for them relative to acquisitions. I think it's a little early to talk about that. Obviously if something made a lot of sense, we'd consider it. And that outlook relative to the acquisitions that we might look at maybe a little bit different today than it was a couple years ago.
Frank Schiraldi: Got you. Okay. And then just lastly on, Bill on the buyback the additional authorization, does this signal maybe a, a pickup inactivity, or is it still more opportunistic just given, your growth opportunities organically?
Bill Burns: Yeah, I think we're going to, this is bill. I think we're going to be opportunistic there, watch the level of growth going to remain active and how aggressive we are will depend on a bunch of things, including growth as well as what the share price is.
Frank Schiraldi: Right. Okay. So with the given growth particularly strong right now, is it fair to say it the levels we saw in this quarter might be a reasonable place to think about buybacks. 
Frank Sorrentino: Could say that, one of the reasons for the preferred issue was to give us more flexibility on buying back comment. So it depends if that's what you want to use for your model, that's fine. It could be a little more aggressive than that. Got to still think and we still think the stock is cheap here.
Frank Schiraldi: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Perito with KBW. Please proceed.
Michael Perito: Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys say where it in, in south Florida, the office you were planning to open is going to be?
Frank Sorrentino: Yeah, it'll be in the West.
Michael Perito: I'm sorry. I don't know if it was just my phone, but you broke up there a little bit. Frank, what was that?
Frank Sorrentino: West Palm Beach area.
Michael Perito: Got it. Okay. And then in terms of the, the loan growth outlook bill, you mentioned still comfortable with kind of the 10% plus or, or minus next year. Don't want to kind of push too hard on it, but it seems like there there's quite a few tailwinds at, at your back here. I guess is there, is, is that more just conservatism and, obviously it's hard to have line to sight on the pipeline that far out, or are there other kind of dynamics in the marketplace that you think could, could slow down the production that you guys have seen, the last couple quarters and, and seemingly expect to continue into next quarter,
Frank Sorrentino: Mike, maybe I'll say a couple of words and maybe bill will add to it, but, certainly we have a strong pipeline sitting here to, and I think we are taking advantage of a lot of the opportunities that have built up in the marketplace here in 2021. But when we look ahead while we see a strong pipeline, there's a lot of headwinds out there. The economy in general could possibly, slow down. We're seeing signs of that already. A lot of the pent up demand that existed in the New York marketplace is beginning to wait a little bit. Really, if you could tell me what's going to happen with interest rates, maybe we could talk a little bit more about, there are those who think interest rates will definitely rise, which will definitely tamp down some of the interest in, in various markets.
Michael Perito: So if you think interest rates are going to remain low, then I would tell you there's going to be fierce competition for assets. So there's, there's just a lot that when we sit here, can we sustain 5% per quarter growth?
Frank Sorrentino: The answer's probably not. And we would probably be happier especially with our dis disciplined approach. Keep in mind, we're not just having growth for growth sake, we're putting growth on while being disciplined around margin spread and credit quality. And so therefore we just don't see as we look out over the horizon at the 2022 being able to get higher than probably single digit high single digit and possibly break double digits for the year of 2022. Now we could be wrong in either direction. But we think that's probably the most reasonable assessment based on what we know today. And it's going to take everything that we're doing at this moment in time. And I think that's why talks a little bit more about, the expense growth to achieve even that level of growth, which you may think is conservative is going to take everything we have including bringing on, new lenders, new markets, new products and services I think to achieve that. I hope we're wrong and I hope we're sitting here a year from now, laughing about how we underestimated it, but I think to be realistic about it, when you think about what the numbers are, the amount of payoffs what's happening with interest rates and what's really going on in our marketplace, I think we'd be very pleased to be able to hit that level of target.
Michael Perito: Makes sense. Thanks. Thanks for that additional color. And then, kind of leads into my, my last question, which is just, nothing major, but we saw a couple, there there's been a handful of banks in the Metro New York area this quarter where we've seen some upticks on non accruals or delinquencies or things like that. I know personally we've started going back into the office a little bit, still a lot of vacant buildings, but definitely some more activity. And I was curious if you could just give, you kind of, you did and in your prior answer, but just maybe a little bit more credit, specific update on, on, on the Metro New York area. And if you're seeing any trends or anything that's like kind of more, had you more alert than, than maybe three or six months ago.
Frank Sorrentino: Listen, I think there's had to be some fallout from the pandemic. a year and a half ago, we all were really nervous and we're in a much, much better place. So there are just select areas, select credits where there is some, impairment going on. We've run into a couple of those. We're taking care of them. Even the charge off that we had this quarter that slight charge off got us 10 basis points. We already had taken a reserve for it. So I think we're well ahead of the curve on it, but any bank that says they don't have any issues from the pandemic, I just can't believe it. So we've taken reserves well in excess of anything that we need.
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Breese with Stephens. Please proceed.
Matthew Breese: A few questions. So maybe first, could you give us an idea of where incremental loan yields are coming on versus what's on the books, particularly in kind of commercial real estate multifamily and CNI of the blended rate, excluding any fees associated with is about 3 75. So that's pretty strong my view. Yeah. Okay. And then, Bill, I appreciate the NIM guidance. It's been a tough one to model during the cycle because of fluctuations and liquidity for, for, for the industry, not just yourselves, could we maybe try to hold own in the guide on NII versus NIM? Year to date, you're up about 10%. Do you feel like the pace of NII growth can mimic what you're seeing on loan growth from here? Maybe give us some color there.
Bill Burns: Well, I think the growth is going to surpass the margin compression, so we'll continue to have increases in net interest income, but if you have margin compression, you're going to, that's going to put a little bit of a damper on that interest income growth. Now I, I ha I keep saying we're going to have compression and we don't we continue to reprise CDs lower, and we seems to benefit from that. But if you add up our, our spreads, which you don't include match funding and include the value of core deposits increasing, it's still a little bit lower than our core margin. So when I look at that, that's how I come up with my estimate of a few basis points per quarter, on a core margin compressing for any given you're right. It's very hard to assess. There's still, prepayments fluctuating PPP income acquisition is not consistent all the time. And then of course for all banks less so for ConnectOne, excess cash is all over the place. But look, we pride ourselves on keeping a stable margin and we continue to focus on that. And as Frank was alluding to before about loan growth, we, yeah, we could let grow loans to 20% if we cut our rates but we're going to be disciplined and make sure the margin is make sure the margin on new loans is appropriate to maintain the margin where it is. And, and that could keep our loan growth at just the 10% level, which is not bad.
Matthew Breese: Understood. Okay. And then just on the hiring front, obviously there's a lot of your key competitors involved in deals now, or recently have been, can you just talk about the conversation flow on, on new lenders, new lending teams and hires have, have those conversations accelerated or decelerated, and then along those same lines, does all this disruption and change does it, change where whole bank M&A stacks up on your priority list? 
Bill Burns: So I'll take the first question first, which is, I think the conversations, I would say they've modestly increased over time. Although this year it's been dramatically more than in years past we've talked about this, the last couple of calls where we think we're in a fairly unique marketplace relative to the amount of M&A a activity that's going on specific to our organization, meaning, for bank hour size with our capabilities and the types of talent we're looking to hire, we feel this is sort of a unique time. Most of the talent that's reaching out to us is at organizations where they felt that they had a really good thing going and now are not so confident in the future going forward. They've learned about the culture here at ConnectOne, or they've come in contact with it because they've competed with us in the past. And when they made a decision about where they think they want to go, one of the first places they're calling is ConnectOne. So I think those conversations are modestly accelerating. I know there's, inbound calls here all the time. We continue to interview and place people, growing our staff 5% in one quarter is not typical here at ConnectOne bank. So we're are clearly taking advantage of those increased phone calls, and we expect that to continue over, the short to moderate near term. So I look, I think that's great and these are great folks. They fit right in here at ConnectOne, and they've been making a difference from the moment they hit the ground, as far as how do we think about M&A, I really think we've always thought about it this way. We've always projected the company as an organic growth or organic first growth company. And to me that's the best way to create value. It's the best way, to maintain our culture, which is the thing that scares me the most, how do we do all these things and still maintain who we are and what we do and how we do it. But that, that being said, I think we've done some pretty goods that have been allowed us to leapfrog in size scale and in some cases, ability. And so those opportunities I think, are still out there. But Matt, I think the point you're trying to make is, yeah, it's hard. we do have to put it up against that to say, where do we want to put our efforts? How do we want to deploy our capital and what makes sense? And I think we say over and over again, we're a disciplined acquirer. And I think that's true. Again, all that being said, we're going to do things that we think make sense here at ConnectOne. And I think that's why we are where we are today with probably some of the best metrics we've ever had in our history.
Matthew Breese: Great. Appreciate that. Just two more from me. So the first one is how many lenders are part of the south Florida team and is this team native to Florida or are they planted from somewhere or are they coming from somewhere else?
Bill Burns: Yeah, this is a team that originally was at stone, which is a bank. We had a lot of a lot of respect for there's two lenders there today together with the support team. And we expect to add to that team over the over the course of time.
Matthew Breese: Okay. And then the other one is, obviously throughout history, there's been a lot of banks that have made the jump from Metro, New York city and the Northeast to Florida. Some of these ums have gone really well. Others have gone, not so well. Can you talk a bit about the demographic trends in Florida, this cycle and, and what gives you confidence about what's going on down there that you can underwrite to the same high credit standards that you do in New York City and things can go well?
Bill Burns: So I certainly sat among the folks who years ago did not, or could not understand making the leap from New York to Florida. And maybe I didn't see it early enough. So Matt, I share, the skepticism relative to, can this work, will it work? It's worked for some, maybe hasn't worked for others. History would, would tell us, moving out of geographic markets is may or may not be a good move for some organizations. But, when I really start to think about, and, and all of us here start to sit with our clients and listen to what they're doing and why they're doing it and how they're thinking about businesses. I actually started to think about Florida, not as an offensive move, but almost a defensive move. We have clients that are devoting a fair amount of their capital to the Florida marketplace because of demographic trends because of tax scenarios because of the growth in that marketplace. And there are quite a number of New York banks, or, or New York located banks that have presence in Florida. And as we all know, everybody around all 5,000 banks today can do business in Florida. There's really no more geography traffic boundary around where a bank can do business or not, especially in this new digital age. And so I started to think about our clients going to Florida, having to go to a different bank to do business there, and that bank would have exposure to New York. And so we'd have competition from Florida for our New York business. And so from our perspective it's, I don't want to say it was just as, as easy as going long island from, New Jersey, but it's almost that simple, a decision, relative story. There's no place else in the country that looks like that to us at this moment in time. There is clearly a very strong connection between the New York city market and the south Eastern part of Florida, whether, from Miami up to Palm beach county. And so from our perspective this just made perfect sense. Understood.
Matthew Breese: I appreciate all that color. That's all I had. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question is from David Bishop with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed.
David Bishop: Hey most of my questions have been asked and answered, but Phil I think he alluded to the fact that there could be some opportunities still to, to lower deposit costs, maybe on the CD front, maybe give us an update what the repri schedule maturity schedule looks like, and maybe the cost benefit from what's rolling off in current rates.
Bill Burns: Yeah, it's about still another 800 million over the next year. The, the benefit of the rate about a hundred points benefit about a hundred basis points benefit. So still continuing, not as steep as it was.
David Bishop: Got it. Then maybe Frank obviously another strong quarter for, for multifamily. Maybe just update what you're seeing in that mark in terms of supply and demand and pricing opportunities on, on that product. Thanks.
Bill Burns: Yeah, I think it was a strong quarter for multifamily. I think a lot of that had to do with some very specific opportunities in the marketplace. Some organizations out there that are competitors also had big pipelines of multifamily, couldn't get deals done on time. And so we saw a little bit of an advantage from that being able to execute better than maybe some of the competitors that had their pipelines clogged up. I do think the multifamily space is still a, strong asset here in the New York pet market rents have definitely rebounded from their lows. There are now bidding wars over rents on particular at particular sites, but it's still a very tricky asset relative to pricing competition and really knowing, where the asset's located and having a great relationship with the operator for those operators and managers that we have an ongoing and longstanding relationship with, we're continuing to support those folks they're seeing some opportunities, some are finding that the market's getting overheated in certain places. And so they're deciding not to participate in particular areas. Others are moving more quickly into areas where they think opportunities exist and we're there to support them. I think it's one of the reasons why I said before. I do think there are some headwinds as we start to move into the early part of next year with potentially rising interest rates and just, a quite hot, or maybe even some cases over heated market as we move into the end of this year. So I think we, I think we need to keep a close eye on that entire portfolio not, not so much the portfolio, but the, but the pipeline that's going into that portfolio over the next quarter. It's yeah, just add the yield including fees is in the 3 25 to three 50 range. So, the spreads are, are a little narrower than our other lines of, of other segments of our loan portfolio.
