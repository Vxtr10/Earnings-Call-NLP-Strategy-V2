"Operator: Good morning. My name is Frank, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Please go ahead, sir.
Bryan Gill: Well, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 16, 2021, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Demchak: Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you saw, we had a solid start to the year as we grew revenue and controlled our expenses to generate positive operating leverage in the linked quarter comparison. Our first quarter results also benefited from our provision recapture, driven largely by an improving economic outlook. Despite this recapture, our reserves remain at over 2% of loans as we continue to work through the COVID fallout and work to understand potential secular changes on certain asset classes. Our capital and liquidity levels also remain at record highs. With a rise in term yields, we've been deploying some of this excess liquidity and increased our investment securities by $9 billion at period end. You'll notice they didn't change much on an average basis as we bought later in the quarter. We also actually added another $9 billion in  that are going to settle early in the second quarter here. And finally, we've continued our purchase activity into the second quarter, and we continue to operate, notwithstanding this at very high levels of cash at the Fed that can be deployed over time in loans or securities based on market opportunities. While not a surprise, the quarter was impacted by continued weak loan demand in the face of strong bond market issuance levels, pay downs and competition resulting in historically low utilization levels. Based on the strength of the U.S. economy, we would expect to see loan demand improve and ultimately drive utilization rates higher over time. We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, including our national expansion, which will significantly accelerate through our pending acquisition of BBVA USA. We're making good progress on BBVA integration planning and are on track for a midyear close, pending regulatory approval. We haven't found any significant surprises regarding the quality or nature of BBVA's business, and our employees are working effectively with their BBVA counterparts on everything, including the technology conversion. With the quality of BBVA markets, especially in their largest market, in Texas -- and the quality of their largest markets, especially in Texas, and is proving to be everything we hoped it would. As we planned for the integration of BBVA USA, we continue to invest in and leverage our own technology so that we can better serve our customers.
Rob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we reported first quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $4.10 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loans declined by $8 billion or 3% due to lower utilization and continued soft loan demand. Investment securities grew approximately $700 million or 1% linked quarter. However, on a spot basis, balances increased $9 billion or 11% as we accelerated our purchase activity near the end of the quarter due to the steepening yield curve. Our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $85 billion in the first quarter, driven by continued deposit growth and lower loan balance.  On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $365 billion and were up $6 billion or 2% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter due to the runoff and redemption of debt obligations. Our tangible book value was $96.57 per common share as of March 31, a decrease on a linked-quarter basis primarily due to a decline in AOCI. Year-over-year, tangible book value increased 14%. And as March -- as of March 31, 2021, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.6%.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. 
Betsy Graseck: So 2 questions. One, on your NII guide. You mentioned up approximately 2%, that's for the first quarter. But then in the commentary around…
Rob Reilly: Second quarter.
Betsy Graseck: Second quarter, sorry.
Rob Reilly: Yes. That's right.
Betsy Graseck: Right. And then in the commentary around your securities book, you were highlighting that you're planning to raise securities book to what, 20% to 25% -- 25% to 30% by year-end. So I just wanted to kind of get your sense as you're building towards your goal by year-end, should we be anticipating that this rate of change of improvement in second quarter NII is something that we should be expecting could persist if the forward curve sticks around where it is in 3Q and 4Q as well?
Rob Reilly: Sure. So yes, again, that was for the second quarter on the NII guide. When we take a look at the full year -- and this is part of our guidance in terms of revenue being stable for the full year, we do expect some more NII from our securities book as we increase the balances, and that's going to be offset by a little bit less loan growth than what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. So that's where we come out in terms of stable.  In regard to the building up of the securities book, I mean, it's 3 things, really. One, we have put more money to work because the curve has steepened. Second, we're going to continue to do that in a measured way. And then third, for the foreseeable future, we'll be running as a percentage of our interest-earning assets securities balances at a higher level. So historically, we've been approximately in the 20% range. We're guiding toward more of the 25% to 30% range.
Bill Demchak: Yes. And Betsy, the only thing I would add is, you said it's kind of a goal. It's not really a goal. It's just our expectation, given the carry right now and how much cash we're sitting on that -- the reason we put that in there is that our security balances, and frankly, for the whole industry are likely to run higher as a percentage of our total assets than they have historically. And we'll keep adding to them throughout the year opportunistically as we've done. But you see that in the actions late in the fourth quarter -- sorry, late in the first quarter. If we were simply trying to drive NII, we could have front-loaded those purchases at lower yields and had NII flat. We didn't do that. We waited. Waiting turns out to have been the right thing. And you'll see us do that. You've seen us do that, but you'll see us continue to do that through the course of the year.
Betsy Graseck: I totally get it. It's such an unusual environment here with the loan-to-deposit ratio is so low and what's going on with the liquidity in your books, so that makes a lot of sense. And the revenue being stable for the full year with the loan commentary you just made, I mean part of that is a function of the PPP roll-off that's expected. Is that fair?
Rob Reilly: Yes, in part. Yes, that's all part. That's all built in.
Betsy Graseck: And then on your -- yes, go ahead.
Bill Demchak: I’d just say, look, the biggest unknown on loan growth specifically is when the inventory start -- the inventory build starts for our corporate customers. Utilization is running as much as 11 points below the peak, maybe 5 points below sort of historic averages. And even though the economy is really kind of taken off here, for whatever reason, we haven't seen the typical inventory build and CapEx that you would see in this economy, I guess just hesitancy waiting for more certainty on the pandemic. But when that happens, and it will happen, it almost mechanically has to happen, you're going to see pretty appreciable loan growth. We just don't know when that's going to be.
Rob Reilly: Particularly as it relates to 2021.
Bill Demchak: Yes.
Betsy Graseck: Got it. All right. And then just separately on the BBVA USA projected PPNR, that $700 million, up $100 million from your prior guide. What's driving that delta?
Rob Reilly: Yes. As I said in my comments -- Betsy, this is Rob. It's largely refinements in our assumptions around interest rates and some general true-ups relative to the assumptions that we had at the time that we announced the deal.
Betsy Graseck: But just based on our prior conversation, is it more that you're expecting they have more asset sensitivity in their book than you thought before?
Rob Reilly: Not necessarily. No.
Bill Demchak: There's so many little things. Rates moved in our favor. We're doing really well on expense opportunities, a whole variety of things, and they ended up…
Rob Reilly: Yes, that's right, true-ups from assumptions that we made last November, and the environment has changed a lot.
Bill Demchak: And our knowledge.
Rob Reilly: And our knowledge, that's right. That's right.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
John McDonald: Bill, I wanted to follow-up on the loan growth thoughts. We're all just kind of thinking out loud here. But could we see the inventory and the CapEx pickup, but still not kind of see loan demand because corporates have a lot of cash and other alternatives in supply? How much is that a factor too do you think going on right now?
Bill Demchak: That will obviously impact our large corporate book, which I think at the moment, has its lowest utilization rate ever. But the bulk of our book, remember, some 90-plus-percent of our clients are private companies. And so our middle market and commercial book really doesn't have access to the public markets and that cash build that you're seeing in large corporate. So I do think you'll see utilization there increase. By the way, we've seen utilization increases in our asset-based lending book but they're small. That's kind of the first place you would expect to see it. So that's encouraging.
John McDonald: Got it. And Rob, did you say that you're not building in a second half pickup too much in your expectation?
Rob Reilly: Yes. That is what I said, John, yes. Because at this point, it’s conjecture.
John McDonald: Yes. And Rob, a follow-up for you. Obviously, your capital ratios have gone quite high. Is it fair -- and I know you don't want to get into deal assumptions and all that. But is it fair to us -- for us to think that you'll end -- close the deal with higher capital than the 9.3% pro forma just given where you're starting from now. And could you remind us to just what CET1 ratio feels appropriate as a target for you guys longer term?
Rob Reilly: Yes. Sure. Sure. On the BBVA, I would say, on everything, we'll have a whole bunch of numbers for you once we close the deal. But for today's purposes, we're tracking at or above all of our assumptions including the CET1 ratio. So yes, my estimations are that it will be higher than that 9.3%, but we'll get into that detail once we own the bank.  In regard to our targets, we've always set around 8.5%. That's been sort of the level that we felt comfortable with. Obviously, we've been a lot higher than that. So the relevance of that number isn't as strong as it was a few years ago.
Bill Demchak: John, you're asking the question, are we going to have excess capital that can be deployed in share buybacks and other things. And the answer is, yes.
Rob Reilly: Yes. That's right.
John McDonald: Yes. And the deal doesn't change or how you think about the right capital level for the company?
Rob Reilly: No. No.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
Scott Siefers : And maybe to revisit the loan growth thing. So I mean, you guys are seeing same trends as everybody else, but you guys are a bit unique in terms of how much of the country you see. Are there any geographic differences on utilization or sort of hesitancy on inventory? I mean, certain parts of the country just didn't necessarily shut down. They reopened earlier, more quickly, et cetera. I guess, I'm just curious if there's any differences either geographically or anywhere?
Rob Reilly: Not particularly, no. We haven't seen geographic differences. Utilization is low across the board.
Bill Demchak: I think one of the issues is supply chains have been so disrupted that people actually can't build inventory. And we're strangely being held back by demand and production capacity.
Scott Siefers : Yes. Yes, that definitely makes sense. It's just such an unusual phenomenon, but I appreciate the thoughts there. And then maybe just more of  one. The other fee expectation, so it was a very, very strong quarter this quarter. I think the guide is a bit higher than is typical in the second quarter. Just maybe sort of the nuance, Rob, just sort of how you're thinking about that line going forward?
Rob Reilly: Yes. That's -- we get some volatility on that quarter-to-quarter because there's a lot of elements there. But the guide is $300 million to $350 million is what we expect to occur in the second quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Erika Najarian: During this earnings season, we've asked a lot of questions as analysts of when loan growth is going to recover from a cyclical standpoint. But I'm wondering, given the deal expected to close in midyear and as we think about how this could potentially help. Maybe, Bill, talk through how these newer markets could potentially give you an even better opportunity to capture loan growth recovery once that come?
Bill Demchak: I think that's going to be the case. But I think one of the things we've been careful to do and sort of framing our expectations for you guys around BBVA we recognize that there are parts of their balance sheet that we would likely shrink, both because of concentrations across the combined firm but also because there are some sectors they don't want to be in, offset by our growth in these new markets. So in the out years, I get really bullish about our growth potential. But for the first year or so, we're going to -- and we've -- this is all in sort of the numbers we gave you, there's going to be a little trade-off of we'll be growing the business we want as we shrink some of the business we won't. So the real acceleration is probably a couple of years down the road.
Erika Najarian: Got it. And as you have made more progress on -- towards closing the deal, can you give us a sense of, you still feel like there's not going to be a significant amount of investment that you have to put into the combined franchise in terms of technology and other things. So obviously, some investors are thinking about another deal that had closed prior, where there was a lot of investment spend that was a little bit of a surprise. That's the question.
Bill Demchak: I won't talk about what other people are doing, but we pretty much have this nailed down. We know -- and it's all in the numbers we've given you. We are going to invest in certain capacity for their branches, for example, on connectivity, faster routers, we're going to expand some of the compute capacity we have in our cloud. But all of that we've given you -- and it's not a big deal, it was all on the deal assumptions and all those thing are proving to be correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Ken Usdin: I just wanted to follow-up on the fee side, 3 to 5 growth in the second. It was pretty good numbers to begin in the first. Just wondering if you could help us understand just where you expect growth is coming from and what do you think is going to lead that forward?
Rob Reilly: Sure, Ken. Yes, I would say on the fees, as we look forward to the second quarter relative to the guide, corporate services and consumer services will be up, we'd expect in sort of that mid-single-digit range and then the other fee categories, asset management, mortgage and service charges on deposits, probably low single-digits. So that's sort of how we get to that range.
Ken Usdin: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up on mortgage, obviously, not a bigger line for you guys. But just given some changes in the business you guys have been making and the relatively new platform. Just do you see share gain opportunities? And is the fight just against gain-on-sale margins in terms of just how resi can continue to build over time?
Rob Reilly: Yes. I mean, hey, mortgage isn't as big as a percentage of our business as others, but we're very excited about what we've built and the opportunities that we have. Particularly, the market will do -- what the market will do is particularly around building out the purchase side in terms of our consumer customers, which will be expanded with the BBVA acquisition.
Ken Usdin: Okay. Last little follow up. Just, Rob, I know you guys don't really give us a number on just premium inside the bond book. But can you just help us understand, has it been a drag? Is it -- you're buying a lot of bonds, you're probably still buying some premium bonds, too. Just how should we just think about that big picture?
Rob Reilly: Yes. It's come down a little bit, and we'd expect it to continue to come down a bit.
Ken Usdin: Even with purchases?
Rob Reilly: And it is in the numbers. Yes, even with the purchases.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Mike Mayo: In terms of the guidance for the acquisition, so from $600 million to $700 million. Look, the bank index is up 40% since November 15 when you announced the deal. So I guess, it seems logical that your benefits are going to be greater, especially with a fixed price. So what does that mean for 2022 and the ultimate savings? I mean, mathematically, it's -- if you look at the industry and you look at BBVA, of course it should be higher at this point. It is good timing. Can you say what it means for the next kind of couple of years?
Bill Demchak: I'm trying to figure out where you're going with that, Mike. I mean, we're going to -- once we close the deal, we'll give you some updates on numbers and so forth. I guess what I would say to you is, we remain -- I remain, and also even to a greater extent, really excited by the growth potential of this deal. We tend -- when you do a deal, you give kind of a year and a half worth of guidance when all the marvels are thrown up in the air and you're working on cost saves and integration. The potential of the franchise in these markets is phenomenal. The potential for cross-sell and for growth of new clients is phenomenal. And we're really excited by that.
Mike Mayo: I guess I'll just wait until you close it and get more information for 2022 guidance.
Rob Reilly: And we'll have it.
Bill Demchak: Yes. 
Mike Mayo: Okay. Well, let me get some concrete numbers from you. I love what you're saying about the loan data. I just -- I love data. So when you say you're 11 points below peak utilization and 5 points below average, what are those numbers? And you also say corporate lending utilization is the lowest ever. What's that percentage? If I could have those, that would be great.
Bill Demchak: So the only one I can think of right off the top of my head is, our corporate finance utilization is 57% of the peak number. And I think -- I saw some....
Rob Reilly: That was lower there. Yes.
Bill Demchak: And that's a function of all the corporate cash. That the 11-point drop was off of the high utilization we saw, Mike, with all the draws during the first quarter of last year, which is why the average maybe 5%. And it's hit -- certain areas have been impacted more than others. municipal utilization is way, way down. As I said, corporate finance is way, way down. Even our asset-based business, which typically runs fairly high utilization has really struggled just given the lack of ability to build inventory. So I don't know if you remember the number, Rob, but we've messed around with -- if you kind of regress economic growth, retail sales, a whole bunch of other different things against -- and inventory levels against loan utilization, it's in squared up over 80. And it should be growing today. We just haven't seen it. I can't give an answer as to why.
Mike Mayo: And then last one. You said private companies are over 90% of your customers as a percentage of loan balances, how much of that be could you say?
Bill Demchak: That's by number. So by loan balances, it's -- I'm going to say it's half.
Rob Reilly: Yes, that's right. That's a better number. And that's obviously on the institutional corporate side. Yes.
Mike Mayo: And just -- I mean, I guess you're just being conservative or what? Because you're saying it has to “Mechanically has to happen. It's in the process.” You're starting to see an asset-based lending, but you're not building it in your expectations even for the fourth quarter of this year. So is that just you being conservative or…?
Bill Demchak: Yes. No, it's us saying -- look, Mike, we could sit here and tell you all of them, and I’ve latched some of these calls. So the back half of the year is going to be great. Everything will be wonderful. I hope they're right. And if they're right, we'll do really well. But I can't promise you that….
Rob Reilly : Or specific timing. 
Bill Demchak: Yes. What we show you is the stuff we know. I know that mechanically our loan balances are going to grow as the economy improves and they build inventories. I can't tell you the timing of that. By the way, nobody else can either.
Operator: . Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Gerard Cassidy: Can you guys talk about -- your deposit balances, of course, are up dramatically. You've given that to us. And Bill, you've talked about the utilization of your customers with the liquidity. Is that the #1 driver of possibly taking deposits down? Or some of your custody bank is not necessarily your peer, but the custody banks are hoping for higher rates to bring their balances down. How much would rising short-term interest rates help you guys bring down your deposit balances to get the loan-to-deposit ratio in more of a historical relationship without having the loans having to grow dramatically?
Bill Demchak: I don't think rising short-term rates has any impact at all. I think as a practical matter, deposit balances in the industry are driven by the size of the Fed's balance sheet and fiscal transfers, coupled with loan growth. Loan growth will actually drive more deposit balances once we see a pickup in that. And I think excess liquidity in the system is here to stay for a long period of time. Because I don't think the Fed is going to shrink their balance sheet anytime soon. So I think we're going to be in a -- there's a structural change in banking, which is going to have more liquidity, higher security balances for an extended period of time.
Rob Reilly: For the foreseeable future for sure.
Bill Demchak: Yes. 
Gerard Cassidy: Very good, which obviously, I agree with you guys on that as well. Shifting over to the allowance for credit losses in your slide, I think it was Slide 10, you gave us good color on the levels and what drives those with the portfolio changes and the economic qualitative factors, recognizing BBVA is going to influence this number on the out years. But when you look at the reserves and you compare them to the day 1 reserves back in January 1, 2020, which you guys show here, you're still well above them. And if the economy over the next 12 to 18 months is even going to be better than what we all thought on January 1, 2020, pre-pandemic, that would suggest reserves should come down. Do you think you'd get close to that day 1 level? Or is that just too low?
Rob Reilly: No. I think you can get there to that level. It's just a question like as you pointed out in terms of timing. So our reserves right now reflect our current forecast. If subsequent forecasts are more bullish or more optimistic, we'll continue on that trend. But the timing of how fast we would get there, Gerard, it’s per earlier comments, difficult to be precise about.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matt O'Connor: Can you talk about your interest rate positioning post the actions you plan to take in the securities portfolio and then also after you fold in BBVA USA? I realize there are some moving pieces, but what would your expectations be in terms of how asset sensitive you are in factoring those 2 things in?
Rob Reilly: We're going to still end up being asset sensitive. I mean, largely because even with our suggested build, the deposits we're going to have with the Fed are going to be quite large. I would tell you that our duration of equity and measured asset sensitivity has decreased as a function of the rise in rates, but that's less about what we're doing and more about the negative convexity in the bank's balance sheet.
Matt O'Connor: Okay. Any way to kind of just frame how meaningfully levered you will be to rates, I guess, both the short and long end?
Bill Demchak: No. I mean….
Matt O'Connor: I guess, put another way, like you have a lot of leverage to rising rates now, but as you grow the securities book…
Bill Demchak: We're hardly going to dent it. I mean the chart -- you see the chart we have in there, where you see our cash balances versus security balances. But any loan growth you want in there, we're not buying the long end of the curve and we have a massive opportunity to deploy that. But as we always do, we're going to increment our way in. By the way, incrementing our way in is what gets us to that 25%.
Matt O'Connor: And then separately, I'm probably getting a little ahead of myself here. But as we think after the BBVA deal closes, you've clearly shifted your view to wanting branches nationally. And would the thought be to lead with organic growth? Or because you're basically folding them into your platform, would you be ready to do another deal, maybe quicker than normally? We certainly mechanically would be ready to do another deal. I think like all things, it's a function of where you created value. It's cheaper to go organically, which it was for a bunch of years, then we would choose that route. I personally believe that we will see opportunities in smaller institutions simply because of the massive shift in technology and the cost of technology that we've seen to serve customers. So, I think low rates, not a lot of loan growth, big technology costs are going to give us opportunities to continue to create scale.
Rob Reilly: And we'll have those capabilities.
Bill Demchak: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.
Bill Carcache: So Bill and Rob, can you discuss how you guys are thinking about pent-up demand dynamics for your consumer versus commercial customers? Where is there greater gearing to the reopening and how to access savings and excess liquidity on both sides, shape review?
Rob Reilly: Well, sort of our outlook for consumer lending, is that sort of what you're getting at?
Bill Demchak: Trying to find your question.
Bill Carcache: Yes. I guess, just thinking about, as we look to like sort of these pent-up demand dynamics and sort of like the reopening and like kind of animal spirits being unleashed as you look to the second half of the year and all of that being a positive for loan growth. Like how does that differ between the consumer and the commercial side? Like there's a lot of liquidity sitting around on commercial balance sheets. There's -- consumer has a lot of savings. But does that sort of delay like the rebound in balance growth on each side? Or are both sides going to be affected similarly or differently? Maybe some sort of perspective.
Bill Demchak: I see where you're going. I think consumer lending is going to drag C&I increase. I think consumers are really flushed with cash. You've seen retail sales. I think they continue to accelerate, by the way. But what's happening is that people who don't are buying and the people who would normally borrow are sitting on fiscal payments that they're going to have to burn through over time before you see balance growth. We're seeing massive transaction volumes. So we see it in our swipe fees in effect. But I don't know that you're going to see balanced growth. I think consumer will lag commercial. And I get back this place where inside of commercial, the smaller non-public companies and even some of the smaller public companies will continue to rely on bank balance sheets to fuel their growth.
Bill Carcache: Got it. That's very helpful. And Bill, maybe I could circle back on a question there, I'd asked you a while ago about sort of the financial technology players like the times of the world, and maybe just specifically on -- any color that you can give on perhaps how active you are in discussions with regulators regarding sort of the uneven playing field with many of these players, particularly some of these players are benefiting from things like unregulated debit interchange, which was never intended for them. It was more for like the small cap -- smaller bank exemption that was intended for post Durbin. And so I guess, is there any expectation of a leveling of the playing field, do you see in the future? Or is this sort of the competitive landscape that is sort of the new reality?
Bill Demchak: So it is a topic of interest, both on the political and regulatory side, less about competition and more about safety and soundness and data protection and fraud. And not -- I'm not referring to Chime specifically, but rather new entrants into the payment space, the exponential increase in fraud we've seen because of less robust know-your-customer rules and frankly, probably just because of the COVID environment. All of that has gathered attention of politicians and regulators. The competition side, we're happy to compete. I'm somewhat shocked actually, nobody's asked me a question about Low Cash Mode that we rolled out this -- yesterday, day before. That product is a result of years of technology investment that allows us, I think, is the only institution in the world to have effectively real-time capability of what's going on in our customers' accounts. And therefore, showing them what's going on in their accounts, and therefore, empowering them to choose what's going on in their accounts. No, fintech has that. Go back to -- because they rely on these small banks as their back office, which, in turn, are relying on 30-year-old cobalt-based mainframe-based batch process, not very exciting core processors. Get on, bring on the competition. At some point, they need to make money and to justify their existence.  Our challenge is presenting -- and we think we do this, a great proposition to our customers with ease of use and the very best products. And I think we have the technology backbone to do that. So I'm less worried about competing with somebody. I'm more worried about safety and soundness to the system and data and disruption to our customers who don't understand where data is being shared and who has access to it.
Bill Carcache: That's very helpful. I was going to ask about the new service, which I saw you talk about it on CNBC, I figured I’d save my question. If I could squeeze in maybe one last one. Are treasury departments of any of your clients even remotely considering the idea of having some allocation to Bitcoin? We've seen some businesses move in that direction. And with the coin-based IPO, I guess, it sort of seems like it's a bit out of left field, but perhaps you can argue becoming more mainstream. And so just wondering, is that something that your treasury function is preparing for? And then maybe on the wealth side, are any wealth clients expressing interest in gaining exposure to crypto assets? Any thoughts on how you guys are sort of positioned for any potential emergence of crypto as a potential asset class, especially in the aftermath of that Coinbase?
Bill Demchak: Well, we've been working on this long before Coinbase went public back, we've talked to Coinbase about partnership and custody for our wealth clients. Practically, we've had a work stream around this, both for our corporate clients and treasury, but also for our wealth clients. The technology stretch isn't a big deal for us. It's more of a compliance-based issues that you would expect; and then importantly, choosing the right partners that you would choose as a trading transfer platform, and importantly, the custody platform. So that's an open and continuing dialogue here.
Rob Reilly: And suitability in fiduciary.
Bill Demchak: Yes. You can imagine that for wealth clients, there'd be a lot of disclosure around. It's your own risk.
Rob Reilly: Right. Right.
Operator: We have a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Mike Mayo: The fintech comment, not me to ask another question. If you think about some of the players in the bank, in the industry, they're starting to set up bilateral relationships, even multilateral relationships with some big tech. And that's an option versus going directly for the consumer, especially with you going national now. Are you looking to continue permanently with getting customers directly? Or are you looking to partner more to lower your customer acquisition cost and go more broadly, kind of like banking-as-a-service as a plan B?
Bill Demchak: We're going to get them directly. Look Mike, I think when you effectively offer your products as the low-cost provider to somebody else who owns the relationship, you've just -- you sold your soul to the devil. It's the beginning of the end of your franchise in whatever space you're playing. We need to own the customer relationship, and we need to deserve to own the customer relationship through an offering that doesn't need to have fintech platform on the front end. It's the alternative to that, right? And this is -- you heard Jamie talk about this as well. If tech gets into the space and owns client relationships, then we become a commodity provider industry with 5,000 participants, it’s a disaster. You can't default to that end game. You have to own the customer.
Mike Mayo: And when you think about the risk with data, to the extent customers open banking and if customers opt-in to share their data with other providers, does that force your hand more? Or how do you defend against that?
Bill Demchak: I think there's a lot of appropriate focus on data. The CFPB, I know, is working on this as our various politicians and other regulators. We need safety and soundness around data. That is the biggest systemic risk at the moment in my view. People talk about cyber, but what they're really talking about is data. And disruption of account flows, payment flows because data is corrupted. The consumer -- that, by the way, is solved, ultimately through tokenized API-based authorization at the bank for what the consumer wants to share, not through screen scraping. And we're working our way towards that. I think that's the ultimate end game. But the consumer has to be empowered to share data, but the data they want and to share it when they want. Not all the time and not everything and not to places that are otherwise, in my view, not regulated in terms of their controls around data.
Rob Reilly: And looking to monetize that data in some way.
Bill Demchak: Yes.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Bryan Gill: Okay. Well, thanks, Frank. Bill, would you like to make any closing time.
Bill Demchak: Thank you, everybody. Look forward to talking at the end of the second quarter. Stay safe. Looking forward to summer here, I hope you're doing the same.
Rob Reilly: Take care.
Bryan Gill: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone."
