"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Urban Outfitters Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the call to Oona McCullough, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. McCullough, you may begin.
Oona McCullough: Good afternoon, and welcome to the URBN third quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. Earlier this afternoon, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three and nine-month periods ending October 31, 2020. The following discussions may include forward-looking statements. It’s important to note at this time, the global COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a significant material impact on URBN’s business. Given an extremely high level of uncertainty about the duration and extent of the virus’ near and long-term impact to the global retail environment, content discussed on today’s call could change materially at any time. Accordingly, future results could differ materially from historical practices and results or current descriptions, estimates and suggestions. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results is contained in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On today’s call you will hear from Frank Conforti, Co-President, URBN; Trish Donnelly, Global CEO, Urban Outfitters Group; and Richard Hayne, Chief Executive Officer, URBN. Following that, we will be pleased to address your questions. For more detailed commentary on our quarterly performance and the text of today’s conference call, please refer to our investor relations website at www.urbn.com. I will now turn the call over to Frank.
Frank Conforti: Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon everyone. It continues to be a year full of challenges, and I believe we continue to meet them head on. All three brands delivered sales improvement from Q2 and recorded lower Q3 markdown rates versus last year. We produced a new record low markdown rate for the third quarter, which helped to drive nearly $100 million of operating profit and an op profit rate above 10%. Our balance sheet remains strong as we paid down the remaining $120 million on our outstanding line of credit and ended the quarter with $634 million in cash and marketable securities. Each brand controlled inventories well and ended the quarter with inventory below their sales performance. I have said it before and I don’t mind saying it again, during an incredibly difficult environment, we could not be more proud of the teams and their exceptional execution. Before I speak about our upcoming quarter, please note, there remains a high level of external uncertainty. The number of COVID cases are spiking at home and around the globe, resulting in more government restrictions. So, as you can imagine, our current views could change at any time.
Trish Donnelly: Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon everyone. I am excited to report the Urban Outfitters Brand delivered a positive 4% global retail segment comp for the third quarter. These comps were driven by exceptional growth in the digital channels in North America and Europe, partially offset by more challenging comps in the store channel. Well-controlled inventory management enabled historically low markdown rates and fast inventory turns. This, coupled with disciplined expense management, led to operating income double that of last year. As I mentioned, the positive global retail comp was driven by our digital channel. All global KPIs, sessions, conversion, and average order value saw impressive increases over last year. All geographical sectors, Americas, Europe, APAC, Middle East and AU/NZ saw positive double-digit ‘comps.’ In addition, every marketing channel, paid and unpaid, positive comped to last year. Most impressive was ‘new’ customer growth in the digital channel. Globally, we gained 36% more customers over last year with both North America and Europe picking up hundreds of thousands of new customers during the quarter. In addition, we launched a new Urban Outfitters website in Mexico and the early results are very exciting. Turning to the retail store channel, despite the obvious COVID-related challenges, the field teams drove impressive increases in both conversion and average transaction value, which helped offset some of the traffic declines. Our retail stores optimized their pick, pack, and ship capabilities and were able to fill close to one million direct-to-consumer units out of store inventories, globally. In addition, we launched ‘UO to GO’, our curbside pick-up capability, which continues to gain traction as we move into holiday. 
Richard Hayne: Thanks Trish. Wow, what a phenomenal quarter. Strong ‘comps’, lean inventories, low markdowns, and well-controlled expenses, all leading to a 100% jump in operating profits. Truly a great, great effort. Thanks, and congratulations to you, Meg and the entire Urban team. Good afternoon everyone. Today, I will discuss our overall results for the third quarter, talk about performance by channel, then by brand, and give my thoughts on the holiday season, before turning the call over for your questions. I am pleased to report URBN produced healthy revenues and excellent operating profits for Q3 versus the same quarter last year. Total ‘comp’ sales were flat, but operating profits soared 31%. In addition, all large brands were profitable and together they delivered the lowest Q3 markdown rate and best full price selling in URBN history. This is a tremendous accomplishment given the environment we faced. Let me now recap performance by channel, beginning with stores. Not surprisingly, the store channel at all brands struggled again in the third quarter. Compared to the previous quarter, ‘comps’ did improve, but stores still faced punishing traffic declines, particularly our high-volume stores in large cities like New York, London and San Francisco. All stores were open for business, but most were either forced to obey crippling occupancy caps or observe restrictions in hours of operation and sometimes both.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, before our question and answer session, I would like to turn the call over to Dick Hayne for comments.
Richard Hayne: Thank you very much and thank you all for joining the call tonight. Before we answer your questions, I just want to reiterate what both Frank and I have said on our prepared remarks and that is the answers to today’s questions that speak to the future outcomes will be based on current information only and our current view of the future. Right now, the external environment is volatile and highly uncertain. For instance, there is no way for us to know if COVID cases will continue to spike or retreat over the coming weeks. Likewise, it’s impossible for us to factor in possible future government lockdowns or store restrictions. Both could have a big impact on our fourth quarter results. Therefore, please understand that our answers today reflect plans developed from what we currently know and actual results could be very different, if the environment changes. With that, I’m happy to tell you where we stand today as we enter Thanksgiving week. Total retail segment comp sales for November to date are essentially flat with our Q3 comp level. Store traffic and comps have softened slightly over the last few weeks. We currently have 68 stores closed to the public due to COVID-related restrictions. 55 of those stores are in Europe, 11 in Canada, and two in the U.S. Of the stores that remain open, 158 or almost a third of our North American fleet are operating with capacity restrictions under 50% of legal occupancy. All stores are currently permitted to pack and ship digital orders. Digital demand on the other hand has improved and offset the dip in store sales. This is especially true in the U.K. where our current digital business is producing triple-digit comps. With that, we will now be glad to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.
Kimberly Greenberger: Okay, great. So, sorry Dick, at the very end there, did you say triple digit digital growth?
Richard Hayne: I did say that Kimberly.
Kimberly Greenberger: I swear I wrote it down wrong.
Richard Hayne: Now, but listen the stores are closed and as an example of how unpredictable this environment is, we just got word this morning that the stores will be able to reopen on December 3. But in the meantime, we are experiencing triple digit growth in our digital. Thank God, we have opened a new fulfillment center in Peterborough, UK. And because of that fulfillment center, we have the capacity to fill triple digit increases.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.
Lorraine Hutchinson: Well, thanks. Good afternoon. Frank, I just wanted to ask you about the balance sheet, you have more cash on hand than you did at this time last year and now you’ve paid down your debt. Can you talk about the potential to resume the buyback and then also how we should be thinking about CapEx next year and beyond?
Frank Conforti: Yes, Lorraine. So, I think right now, given the uncertainty Dick and I have talked about in the fourth quarter, we feel it's prudent to remain flexible and conservative with our cash and our marketable securities. As you know, we always focus on the cash needs, sort of in the same order, supporting our business, investing in our growth based initiatives and then returning cash to shareholders. We do have a Board meeting coming up next week. And as always, I'm sure capital allocation will be a topic of conversation as a Board meeting itself.  We did kick off a new distribution facility that we're going to be building here in North America. I think we actually broke ground on that today in Kansas. That will impact our capital number next year. We don't have a final number in and of itself. We just completed our facility in the UK, and we will be building a new facility next year. We're excited about both of these facilities as Dick said and they both enabled us to continue to support the strong digital demand and growth that we're seeing, and we're excited to be able to continue invest in the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. 
Kimberly Greenberger: Okay.
Richard Hayne: Hi Kimberly, sorry we cut you off.
Kimberly Greenberger: Yeah, no, no problem. I just wanted to clarify that. I wanted to ask just about digital delivery this holiday season, and, you know, obviously there's been some ongoing deleverage in digital delivery, because digital is rising as a percentage of sales. And I wanted to ask, there are some one-time impacts come into the fourth quarter? Can you lay out some of the strategies for us that you're using to make sure that you can get product to consumers and any strategies to offset those costs? As we look to next year, what do you think – what sort of digital delivery cost increases would you expect to be sustained as opposed to which ones are more temporary? Thank you.
Richard Hayne: Okay, Kimberly, I'll take a shot at that. You're right. We're seeing very strong digital. As I said, in my prepared remarks, mid-double-digit sales growth in the digital channel. And when this started in May, you know, we all sat around and said, this could easily continue through holiday. And, gosh, what are we going to do to fulfill those orders. So, we put together a plan, which included increasing the staffing in the fulfill – all the fulfillment centers, beyond what we've done in prior holidays, incentivizing the fulfillment staff by offering additional bonuses and rewards, that are based on performance metrics and attendance, we installed some additional equipment, that is to increase our efficiency and throughput and productivity, we take in some of the newly distribution center space, and converted that into an area to process some of the fast turning holiday items. And we provided additional labor hours in stores, to enable them to handle more pick pack and ship orders. And also in the stores allowed for curbside pickup, where it's practical. So we've done a lot of – taken a lot of steps to be able to handle the surge in demand. And I have to tell you, that fulfillment center has been working, basically holiday shifts since May, and has done an excellent job of performing. And whenever we have any COVID-related issues in those fulfillment centers, Dave  and his staff have taken care of it so we can get right back in and keep working and they've done a great job. What have we seen in the – through the future? Well, I guess you'd have to tell me where you – when you see COVID dying down or going away. After it goes away, I think things will return a bit to more normal charges for delivery. And so, if you think that's going to happen in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, that's when we expect to see it. Until that happens and the stores are continued challenged, I would suggest that the direct business will remain very elevated. The carriers will all have a problem fulfilling that volume and will continue to charge more. That's how I see it. Frank, do you have anything to add to that?
Frank Conforti: I just want to add, Kimberly as it relates to just being able to meet the holiday volume in addition to all the measures Dick talked about from a fulfillment perspective we did go ahead and add additional regional carriers as well to increase our capacity within the network. I also want to highlight, which – it was in my prepared commentary, the biggest delta between how we're looking at Q3 gross profit margin versus Q4 gross profit margin really is about what Dick is talking about, about the increased carrier rates in the fourth quarter in order – and those surcharges related to the demand that the delivery network is expecting to experience in the fourth quarter, as well as us as a company anticipating a higher rate of expedited shipments in order to ensure that she gets her package on time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.
Matthew Boss: Great, thanks and congrats on the improvement. So, maybe Frank, could you help break down same store sales trends by brand in November? And then Dick, just following the sheltered consumer for months now, what's your sense on a fashion cycle potentially emerging on the other side of this crisis? And how are you positioning the brands today to take advantage of that, if that is, in fact the case?
Frank Conforti: So Matt, I'll take the first one. And we don't give out the same store sales numbers by brand, but as Dick did highlight in his prepared commentary over the last week or so of October, as well as the early weeks in November, we did see a decline in traffic and a slight decline in corresponding decline in our store comps and that has impacted all brands fairly consistently. And offsetting that has been a slight improvement in the digital demand enabling us to be flat where – which Dick mentioned earlier on the call.
Richard Hayne: Okay, sheltered consumer. I like that term. I guess the first thing I'd say is, we think that the free people in Urban brands, right now are already taking advantage of fashion demand. And I would encourage both of those brands to just keep doing what they did in the third quarter. Having said that, anthropology, as I suggested, my prepared comments, is known for structured apparel that's appropriate for occasions outside the home, like work dining out events, like graduate graduations, weddings, and parties. We believe post-COVID, whenever that comes, these events will return in full, and I think with vengeance. If you just look at something like weddings, there have been a significant drop-off in the number of weddings and the size of those weddings. And we believe there's a big demand building up for either weddings, or the people who did get married during COVID to have follow-up parties where they can invite lots of people. So, we think there's going to be a lot of events once it's safe. And we think that anthropology is well-positioned to take advantage of those events, and that social interaction outside the home.  So, once it's over, we think the Anthropologie signature look will be back in high demand. Now, when that happens, is – I guess the, as they used to say, the million dollar question, and it's something that we can answer, but we obviously are being conscious about pivoting back too early, which would just cause a lot of markdowns.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adrian Yee with Barclays.
Adrian Yee: Good afternoon, and let me add my congratulations, very well done. So, tough out there.
Richard Hayne: Thank you.
Adrian Yee: You're welcome. Trish, I was wondering if we can focus on the success of, you know, UO as one of the big core brands, how has the U.S. in the UO business permanently changed regarding inventory management, stocking level, and size and breadth of the store offering? And then Frank as we think about next year and this notion of a mean reversion of sales back into stores? Where should we be thinking of the brick and mortar to e-commerce split and the breakeven leverage point for stores? Thank you so much.
Trish Donnelly: Hey, Adrian, it's Trish. In terms of permanent changes to how we’ve managed inventory, there's really nothing we've done differently. I think what the teams have done really well is taking that inventory that we do have and distorting into things that are working, and we had some really strong business in women's, and as I mentioned in my commentary, our highest growth rates for in home, and our ability to pivot into those categories that that were working during COVID, you know, obviously was really good for the business. But in terms of any, you know, permanent changes to inventory, we still manage on the same type  to supply that we always have. And I'll toss it over to Frank for the rest of that question.
Frank Conforti: Hi, Adrian. Unfortunately, I just don't have a lot of visibility on exactly what our model is going to look like going forward. I can tell you that we've modeled many different channel penetration scenarios, but which one comes true right now is really going to depend on the consumer. With that said, yes, we certainly believe the ongoing digital adoption we've seen over the last decade has definitely accelerated during the COVID outbreak, but to what extent, we just don't know. What we do know is we have strong brands, and we have a strong connect and those brands have a strong connection to the customer. We've got excellent operational capabilities and a strong balance sheet. So, honestly, however, the consumer wants to settle in from a shopping channel perspective, we will adjust accordingly. And I think we've done a very good job at quickly adapting this year. And you can expect the same from us in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.
Janet Kloppenburg: Congratulations. Nice job. Frank, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the positive influence of the rent concessions and the government assistance on gross margin, and if that will be a positive influence in the fourth quarter? And to what degree sequentially? And also if lower clearance levels given your inventory levels may also positively influence the fourth quarter gross margin? And in Dick, I know, this is a tough question, but as you think about the pandemic, and the recent news on vaccines, how do you think about planning, sales and inventories for next year? And, you know, when do you expect a nice rebound to emerge? Thanks.
Frank Conforti: Janet, this is Frank, so you're 100% correct. There were rent abatements recorded in the third quarter, as well as government benefits really in Europe as it relates to real estate taxes. We do have some of those deals yet to complete that will favorably benefit the fourth quarter as well. With that being said, none of those were anywhere near the materiality of what drove our gross profit margin improvement in the quarter. It really was led by record low merch markdown rates with all three brands recording lower markdown rate on a year-over-year basis, as well as our wholesale segment recording favorable merch margins on a year-over-year basis. That's really what led the way for us in driving improvement in the Q3 margin.
Richard Hayne: Okay, Janet, planning sales and inventory for FY 2022. Yeah, you did give me a tough one there young lady. When we think about it, we clearly don't know when this vaccine is going to become available. We don't know when it does become available, at what rate it will be available, and we also don't know how quickly the uptake will be from the consumers in this country. So, it's a very, very difficult question to answer about when we might see a return to I guess what we would put in quotes normalcy. How are we planning? We're really planning our spring-summer business on an omni-channel level because we don't know with what the store channel will bring and we don't know what the digital channel would bring, but we're – have some degree of confidence around what the total will bring and I say some degree of confidence. So we plan on an omni-channel and we order inventory to that omni-channel level and then as it gets closer to the point in time we can split the inventory up to go to whichever channel the consumers are favoring. So, I don't know of any other way to do it without the potential of making really gross mistakes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.
Marni Shapiro: Hey, guys, congratulations. And in case I forget, stores look really fantastic, particularly Urban has been just a lot of fun.
Frank Conforti : Thanks Marni.
Marni Shapiro: Could you talk a little bit, you've had a pretty dramatic shift to DTC and Free People was already there. Can you talk about the differences you've seen in the Urban customer and the Anthro customer shifting online. Did they both move very quickly and have they both stayed there or did you see differences there as to how that sort of transpired over the last couple of months?
Richard Hayne: I don't think that there’s been many differences at all. The Urban and Anthropologie customers have shifted just about the same – at the same rate that the Free People customer has, it's just that the stores are larger and they are more impactful and there's more of them. So the penetration of stores for Urban and Anthropologie is greater, but overall, we see them – all three brands we see them definitely migrating to digital. And I do have to tell you that while our inventories have been extremely well controlled, in some cases, they are almost too well controlled, we could have benefited pretty greatly by having a little more home product. Right now, I think we're sitting at around $26 million in back orders, which is primarily in home and a lot of that home product is Anthropologie home, but we don't see much difference in the usage of digital.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird.
Mark Altschwager: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. First, a quick follow-up on the rent concession topic, I'm wondering if there's any update you can share on maybe any bigger picture changes that are happening to rent structures and how that might change the margin algorithm from here in terms of leverage points on store comps and then I wanted to ask more broadly about just growth investments. Balance sheet remains in great shape, appears to be light at the end of the tunnel with a vaccine on the way. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about ratcheting back up growth investments, China, Europe, Free People Movement, wholesale for the various brands, Nuuly, it would seem that there is a lot of levers there. Maybe if you could you just rank order how you're thinking about those over the next couple of years? Thanks.
Frank Conforti: So, is that all, Mark? Let me start with rent. So, I really look at rent in two buckets, one related to the pandemic itself. I think we focus really heavily on being able to achieve rent abatement for the periods that we were closed or significantly restricted from an occupancy perspective and I think we did a great job and we had good partners on the other side as well getting to help the abatements. Those were recorded in second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter and should largely be complete this year. As you talk about sort of a step change function, I think our opportunity is, is we've got roughly about 10% of our fleet coming up for renewal over each of the next three years consecutively and actually between 10% and 12%. So, think about little bit more than 35% or so of our fleet comes up for renewal and I think it's up for us to remain incredibly disciplined as we look at those renewals and push as hard as we can for variable rent. I think percentage rent is something that's really key for us as it's going to be or has been and continue going to be very hard to predict where consumer traffic trends go. So for us as a percentage rent to sales is something that we would really like to push as hard as we can on in order to change that occupancy line item to become more of a variable base than a fixed base. As it relates to SG&A, I think a lot of our SG&A depends on how holiday finishes and our view of the consumer and the channel penetration at that point in time. I think we have honestly consistently shown that we can be nimble and disciplined as necessary. At the same time, you are right, we do believe in the future growth of our brands and our initiatives and we believe it's important to continue to invest in the future in order to grow our business. We always have seen that as the best way to reward our shareholders, as well as our employees. So we will have more commentary on SG&A when we speak on the next quarter call. We have obviously not finished our plans. Like I said, a lot of it will depend on what our current views are on channel penetration at that point in time.
Richard Hayne: Okay, that's all from our side. We thank you very much for joining us on the call today and we wish you all a very, very Happy Thanksgiving.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
