It has also enabled us to generate above industry average gross margin and derive long-term benefits from those brands continued growth.Secondly, in order to provide our members with better shopping experience, we have been upgrading our logistics and distribution capabilities. We are striking a balance between maximizing logistical efficiency and controlling operating costs. We are able to optimizing our product time to market and the replenishment fee.For those product categories, both for market-based model such as apparels and other asset life suppliers. We have need for them on to our marketplaces and platforms. Within a year of launch our market-based business has become a crucial contributor of our company's overall GMV growth and profit generation.For [indiscernible] segment, we try to accommodate our members brands to pursue our wide range of product selection and get better inspiration from watching how other people model their apparel items. At such majority of our apparel items goes through our market-based business platform.

For example for granting full membership benefits to those users surpassing certain spending threshold. We are able to unleash the full spending potential of those users. In addition, beginning in the second half of 2019, we have started cultivate localized user communities to assess effective. In 2020, those local communities will help to increase our unit business and user engagement on our platform.2019 marks the first year of Yunji to achieve positive adjusted net income both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Such milestone achievement especially momentum during the current time of great economic uncertainties as it validates our business model and demonstrate our success in generating steady and healthy growth.In the fourth quarter of 2019, our GMV increased by 36.1 year-over-year to RMB - and our total revenue reached RMB2.55 billion as of December 31, 2019 our cumulative members come to RMB 13.8 million.

So operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andre Chang of JPMorgan. Please ask your question.
Andre Chang: So let me repeat my question. The company has rolled out free membership starting about January 1st to January this year. So I like to ask whether this will mean the membership program revenue will drop to zero this year in exchange for faster sale of merchandise revenue growth and also membership growth. And also whether that will mean some impact on the gross margin as the membership revenue generally usually have a higher margin? Thank you.
Chen Chen: Thank you, Andre. So, I will take this question. So I can give you some background information first, because as a first membership based social e-commerce company history in U.S. so we need to take the responsibility together with local government to continue to refine the standards of this industry and make the new ecosystem better. This new measure we've just published has been widely pushed by local government and are followed by our competitors.So, for this new member recruitment method either for our existing members to invite and build the offline communities based on location. We still believe this kind of connection based on location will be more solid and active since the connection through Internet, but the nature of our finished model has not changed. So our business growth are still based on the supply chain upgrades as our CEO just stated in his remarks. And second, the social interaction between members.So for your questions, so, first of all the revenue of membership revenue yes because we changed the recruitment method. So the membership of revenue will decrease of course. And a second for the margin, because although the membership revenue decreased, but as we mentioned in both CEO and CFO, scripts remarks, because we will - our supply chain, core value of our supply chain to develop to cooperate with the best emerging brands and factories in China and to find their best SKUs.So our margin will come from the emerging brands and our own brands. So we believe the gross margin and operating margin in 2020 will not be negatively impacted by the cancellation of the member fee.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Liu of Credit Suisse. Please ask your question.
Ivy Liu: I'll quickly translate myself so thanks management for taking my question. My question is on membership as well so can management elaborate a bit more on the existing and strategies or tactics to acquire new members and the channels that Yunji invest and how that will impact the sales and marketing line in 2020. And also there are specific growth targets for the membership in 2020? Thank you.
Chen Chen: Thank you, Ivy. So for this question, the first is from 2020 we will not only around the Internet-based membership member recruitment, we will also use the offline measures to promote our members. So based on the location and based on the different living communities all around China, we will encourage our members to get to do the offline promotions. So and for the cost of each new members, we do not change the incentive program.So for the each new members invited by the existing members, we’ll provide the new members for five RMB coupons. So that's our cost to have one new members so this policy not change. And so, we believe the sales and marketing expense will not increase significantly. And but we will continue to monitor the quality of the members from the new member of equipment approach. So we can - we’ll monitor that and we can discuss this with you after one quarter, we will see that better.And for the total member forecasts, because we did not provide the guidance, so we cannot disclose the detail numbers, but we can foresee the total new members joining Yunji through the new policies will increase compared to the previously qualities. But as we said, our focus is - always on how to get the quality transacting members, but not only the members.So, we will through the - so for our members how we can increase the transaction members will encourage through the supply chain either - which will keep creating the public skills of the new brands with the competitive prices. And we are also developing better skills from the emerging brands to compete with this mainstream brands with lower price and higher margins.So, through this deeply cooperating with the emerging brands and factories we’ll provide our members more values to make the new members to become quality transaction members. So, our focus is still is not only on the number of members, but on the number of the quality transaction members. So we will - spend more efforts to transfer the member to the transaction member quarter-by-quarter.
Operator: There are no more questions at this time. I would now like to hand the conference back to the management team for the closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Kaye Liu: Thank you everyone for joining us today. I’ll see you next quarter. Thanks.
