Before I go through our financial results, please note that all numbers stated in the following remarks are in renminbi terms, and all comparisons and percentage change are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Starting this year, we're committed to enhancing our supply chain depreciation strategy, upgrading our product selection with our new megahit product curation strategy and refining our membership management system. More specifically, we launched a series of private label products with our depreciated supply chain. Our branded product has received a great reception from the market, reflected by our high repeat repurchase rate, which reached 80.6% in the 12 months, ended September 30, 2021.

As a percentage of total revenues, sales and marketing expense were reduced to 13.7% from 14.9% in the same period last year.

This concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator:  The first question comes from the line of Ethan Yu from First Trust Group.
Ethan Yu :  Let me do a quick translation. Could you give us more details about our private label product incubations and featured actions to differentiate them from our -- from other competitors? I've also noticed that the company has made some achievements in investment. Could you please share more colors about the company's investment strategy and expectations?
Shanglue Xiao:  So thank you for your question. And we hope that we could make more efforts to promote the Yunji mindset to the customers. During the past several years, we have kept contact and a close conversion with our service suppliers. So we help them to make profit in their cooperation with us. And these are going to be our external communication strategies, and we will be pleased to -- this strategy in the future. And also, we have noticed that in such serious computing e-commerce industry, if you're going to keep a stable development, you have to have a good communication with the customers. And we have done the survey for the T1 e-commerce platform. We find that currently no first-choice food delicacy platforms for our customers. So we hope that we could make more efforts on this area. So when the customers will like to buy the food delicacy, they will choose Yunji as their first choice platform. And also, we have find out about the new food delicacy, the word of mouth is more important than the brands their selves. And also here in Yunji, we have a large number of the members we're going to promote our platform and the food to other customers. So for Yunji, we will try hard to be the first choice for the customers if you're going to buy the delicious food and also, we're going to corporate more with our sharing members and the service providers to make more and promote motivation food brands through our cooperation and R&D to our users. So that is our first priority. We are going to make Yunji the first choice for our customers for the selection of the delicious food and also the food going to be our first category. So in addition to the food development and also in the food category, we know that the word of mouth is more important than the brand itself. In addition to that, we're going to know that we have a quite mature cultivation and tuning system for the cosmetics and the supplements. And especially in those tune areas, we need the service and professional service for the users. And so in Yunji, the private label development, we are going to have a 1 plus 2 strategy. For this one is in the food. These are going to be the priority for our private label development, for the two, that is in the cosmetics. In addition to the supplements, we are going to promote the products for the service strategy for those tune areas. And we know currently in Yunji, our supply chain is quite open. So probably we have a limited development of the private labels. And also, we have noticed that there emerged many emerging brands supported by the new media development. So we not only want to cooperate with such emerging brands, but also we would like to invest in those brands try to have the long-term development. And in conclusion, in after 5 or more years, we’re going to make more contribution for the development of the , the social e-commerce platform. And also, we are going to focus on tune areas full development of the private labels: The food, the cosmetics and the supplements. Thank you for your question.
