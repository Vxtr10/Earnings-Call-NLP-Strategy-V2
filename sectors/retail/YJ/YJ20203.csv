Now, I would like to hand the conference over to your first speaker for today, Ms. Kaye Liu, IRD of Yunji. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Kaye Liu: Hello, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we start, please note that this call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on our current expectations and current market operating conditions and relate to events that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors affecting Yunji’s industry. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminologies such as will, expect, anticipate, continue or other similar expressions. For a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our related documents filed with the U.S. SEC.
Shanglue Xiao : Hello, everyone, and welcome to Yunji’s third quarter 2020 earnings call. In the third quarter, we generated a total GMV of RMB9.4 billion and total revenues of RMB1.07 billion due to our promotion of fast-moving merchandise with high repeat purchase rates. And moreover, we also reduced our net loss by 14.9% year-over-year. And the timely upgrades we made to our membership enrollment system helped us continue increasing the number of transacting members on our platform, which reached 13 million for 12 months ended September 30, 2020. Yunji has been on the path to becoming a full-fledged membership-based social e-commerce platform for the past 5 years. Over the course of this period, we have made many changes and continued to explore new forms of the membership to further improve the value of our membership model. As a result, we have not only provided our members with more benefit and a better e-commerce experience, but also better cultivating our members’ growing passion for sharing. Meanwhile, we have also focused on helping our members to honing their sales potential by providing them with additional sales training. By providing our members with education and training, we have further engraved members’ knowledge also in different segments and enabled them to earn stable income as either streamers or group leaders in our community. Since our IPO, as we strive to create a win-win value proposition for all participants in our ecosystem, we have continued to invest in upgrading our supply chain and optimizing our community to become China's leading membership-based social e-commerce platform. More specifically, we have also continued to develop and introduce joint medicated products into our community by continuously optimizing our supply chain and discover more members with sales potential through introducing more products that better stimulate member-sharing activities. In terms of specific product categories, we are very focused on beauty, food and health supplements. As such, in order to better cultivate large scale products, we maintained ongoing investment into these private label and joint venture brands during the third quarter. As a result of Yunji's investments, many quality suppliers and the leading manufacturers have been able to adapt their business and grow their online traffic to persist in the face of an evolving business environment. In addition, these suppliers and manufacturers also provided end platform users with more premium products at attractive prices. For example, during this year’s Double Eleven shopping festival, our private label and joint venture brands contributed nearly 20% of our total festival GMV. And moreover, during the third quarter, in the GMV of our health supplement product sold exclusively on our platform, it is RMB500 million. In comparison to other products with lower gross profit and less positive user feedback, these large scale products generating higher profits on our platform were endorsed by our members with the sales potential, and it were celebrated by our users.
Chen Chen : Thank you, Shanglue. Hello, everyone. Before I go through our financial results, please note that all numbers stated in the following remarks are in RMB terms and our comparisons and the percentage changes are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.  In light of the increasing competition in the industry, we decided to forgo the destruction of such short-term gains and instead focus our attention on refining our operational efficiency and bolster our operational revenues. In the quarter, we collaborated with regional agriculture providers to create innovative products and further promote the revitalization of our areas and made our live streaming show different. As a result, we continued to steadily advance towards healthy profitability during the third quarter of 2020 and reduced our net loss to RMB43.6 million from RMB51.3 million. Let's now take a closer look at our financials. Our total revenues in the third quarter of 2020 were RMB1.1 billion. Revenues from net sales of merchandise in the third quarter of 2020 was RMB0.92 billion compared to  and accounted for 85.2% of our total revenues in the period. This decrease was due to the transfer of business to our marketplace business model, which was in line with our continuous efforts to improve our operating efficiency and the operating efficiency of our merchants. Revenues from our marketplace in the third quarter of 2020 increased to RMB130.4 million from RMB86.3 million. This increase was driven by an increase in the number of quality brands and the merchants on our platform. It was also due to the higher take rates that we have incurred by both strengthening our existing partnerships with brands and leveraging our growing community influence to attract new brands to our platform.  Revenues from our membership program in the third quarter of 2020 were RMB4.9 million compared to RMB206.7 million and wholly consisting of deferred revenues from prior paying members, in line with our long-term growth plans. This decline was due to the requirement of our membership enrollment system, which allowed the users to register on our Yunji app as members and enjoy membership benefits free of charge for all year.
