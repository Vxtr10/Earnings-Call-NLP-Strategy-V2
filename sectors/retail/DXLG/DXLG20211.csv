"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q1 2021 Destination XL Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Mokas. You may begin.
Shelly Mokas: Thank you Nancy and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on Destination XL Group's first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. On our call today is our President and Chief Executive Officer, Harvey Kanter; and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Stratton.
Harvey Kanter: Thank you, Shelly and good morning everyone. It is my pleasure to speak with you today about DXL and the solid progress we're making in our business financially in terms of sales and profit, as well as in regards to our ongoing strategic transformation. On our fourth quarter earnings call in March, I shared with you my perspective that we were starting to see signs of a shift in consumer buying behavior and our optimism for greater recovery in fiscal 2021 was growing. And starting today's call, while I have several opening comments, I'd want to certainly lead off by saying sales in both our stores and direct channels have continued to accelerate, and our first quarter financial results have materially exceeded our internal expectations. This has been a strong quarter for DXL and the quarter we believe is a step-forward in a post-pandemic world. We were both fortunate and grateful that since we last spoke, our teams and the recrafted operating model in place are working well to drive sales back and enhanced levels of profit as we serve the big indulge consumer through our ongoing digital transformation. Given our first quarter's performance and what we believe is a chapter of greater growth from our initial expectations at the onset of the year, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2021 annual performance, which Peter will cover in more detail later. As I noted, before I get into the first quarter business details, there are a few topics that I want to cover off. First, I truly want you to thank all of our employees in our stores, in our guest engagement center, in our distribution center and in our corporate supporting departments for your unwavering commitment to our mission of empowering big and tall men everywhere to look good and feel good. And I actually wanted to pause for a second here and truly acknowledged, not just thank what the team has taken on their backs to accomplish on behalf of DXL. If not for the dedication and commitment of the teams we have in our stores and our distribution center, our call center and corporate office, we most certainly would have not made it this far.
Peter Stratton: Thank you, Harvey and good morning everyone. I'm very excited to speak with you today about our first quarter results. As Harvey discussed, the turnaround in our sales trends that began in March occurred sooner and more dramatically than we had expected. Along with the increase in sales, we pulled back on promotions and leverage the many cost reductions that we implemented over the past year, which drove improvements in earnings, cash flow and our balance sheet. Accordingly, we are increasing our full year sales and earnings guidance, which I will review with you after I discussed the first quarter results. Due to the significant impact that COVID-19 had on our first quarter 2020 results, I will also compare our results against Q1 of 2019 for better compatibility. So, let's start with sales. Total sales for the first quarter were $111.5 million as compared to $57.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and $113 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. On a comparable basis, total sales increased 3.7% over first quarter 2019. Stores were down minus 6.7% for the quarter to 2019 levels and improved rapidly from minus 33.1% in February to over plus 3% in both March and April. Harvey spoke about some of the tailwinds that we believe the stores benefited from this quarter. And there was a strong correlation to store performance, vaccine distribution, and relaxing of state specific COVID restrictions. While it is uncertain how long each of these tailwinds will last, we are pleased to see similar trends continuing in May. Our direct business continued to build and was up 40.7% over 2019, primarily driven by DXL.com website, which was up 55.8%. We were especially pleased by the high number of new to file customers that have found us through the web. Also worth noting is that even as our store business rebounded in March in April, our website sales also accelerated. So, we did not just experience a migration of direct shoppers back to stores, but an overall lift across all channels.  Our gross margin rate inclusive of occupancy costs was 45.6% as compared to a gross margin rate of 23.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 43.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The 190 basis point improvement over 2019 was primarily driven by a $2.6 million decrease in store occupancy costs, as a result of closing unproductive stores and our ongoing rent reduction initiatives. Even more exciting is the shift in promotional posture that Harvey talked about. Repositioning our brand to be more full price in less reliant on discounts and coupons will continue to benefit us long-term through improved margins and elevation of our brand image with both customers and suppliers. Now, let me move onto selling, general and administrative expenses. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were 33.3% as compared to 56.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 39.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The 33.3% rate is far lower than our historical expense rate and is the result of the cost reduction actions that we implemented in fiscal 2020. These actions were intended to not only preserve liquidity, but to lower our operating cost structure long-term. Most of you will remember that these reductions included reduced store hours and staffing models, reductions in marketing costs, especially through broad-based non-digital channels, a 29% reduction in corporate headcount and elimination of services, travel and discretionary spending. We're being very diligent about preserving as many fixed cost reductions as possible, despite the fact that certain variable costs will increase as our business accelerates. We will continue to invest in our store associates in store hours to ensure that they are properly trained to provide an exceptional DXL guest experience, but we expect store costs to remain significantly below historical levels. Customer Facing Costs were 17.9% of sales in Q1 as compared to 22.6% in the first quarter of 2019. Corporate Support Costs, which include the distribution center and the corporate overhead costs, represented 15.4% of sales in the first quarter compared to 16.9% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were down $7.5 million compared to two years ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.7 million for the first quarter compared to a loss of $18.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 and earnings of $4.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Net income for the first quarter was $8.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $41.7 million or a loss of $0.82 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and a net loss of $3.1 million or a loss of $0.06 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This is the strongest first quarter net income per share that we have delivered in the last 20-plus years.  Next, I'll turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We spent the past year with a relentless focus on preserving and enhancing liquidity. In February, we completed a registered direct offering for 11.1 million shares of our common stock through which we raised $5 million. Also in March, we entered into a new $17.5 million FILO term loan, the proceeds of which were used to payoff our existing $15 million FILO. Our new FILO has a higher advance rate and will provide us with additional borrowing capacity of $5 million to $10 million going forward. Both the stock offering and the new term loan provided additional flexibility to liquidity. In addition, our revolving credit facility, which supports our seasonal inventory purchases remains in place until May of 2023. Free cash flow for the first quarter, which does not include the financing transactions I just mentioned, improved significantly to proceeds of $7 million as compared to a use of $18.4 million in fiscal 2020 and a use of $20.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Most of this improvement is due to our improved profitability as well as improved inventory turn. With our liquidity position fortified, we have returned to our historical practice of utilizing our daily cash inflows to paydown our revolving credit facility. As a result, you will see we have a relatively low cash balance on our Q1 balance sheet, but also a much lower debt balance. For a more consistent comparison, we look at debt net of cash, which decreased to $44.3 million at the end of the first quarter from $68.2 million at the end of Q1 2020 and $72.3 million at the end of Q1 2019. That's an improvement of nearly $30 million from 2019 to 2021. Our revolving credit facility had $51.1 million of excess availability at the end of the quarter. We were very pleased with these improvements to our financial position, lower debt, increased availability and positive free cash flow. We expect to continue using free cash flow generated in fiscal 2021 to paydown debt. And just a couple of quick notes on inventory. Our inventory balance decreased to $88.4 million at May 1st, 2021 as compared to $108.3 million at May 2nd, 2020, and $112.3 million at May 4th, 2019. Of course, last year's inventory was impacted by the unexpected store closures, but we do believe our current inventory levels are more representative of the improved inventory turnover we should expect going forward. Since the first quarter of last year, we have been managing our inventory conservatively, narrowing our assortment while driving meaningfully greater levels of exclusivity with national brands and at the same time, working to meet our supply chain and logistics capabilities. At the end of Q1, our clearance inventory represented 10.1% of our total inventory, which is in line with our long-term goals. We continue to monitor supply chain disruptions across the globe that could delay inventory receipts in the second half of the year. At this time, we don't foresee any sales jeopardy from supply chain disruption, but it is a risk that all retailers are managing as consumption continues to outpace production across a variety of industries. I also want to address a topic that is top of mind for some of our shareholders, and that is whether we plan to return to a national stock exchange, such as NASDAQ. As many of you know, we elected to voluntarily delist from NASDAQ in December, 2020. At the time, we did not meet the minimum listing standards and chose to list our stock with the OTCQX market.  Currently, we do not have any plans to apply for a relisting on NASDAQ. We are aware of the required listing standards for new applicants, which include a minimum share price of $4 per share. As we do not satisfy that requirement today, we are focusing on executing our business strategy, but we'll continue to monitor if there are any changes to the listing requirements. Lastly, I would like to share with you our updated sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2021. Let me start by saying that we continue to live in a rapidly changing world during a very uncertain time. The impact of COVID-19 continues to be felt in both North America and throughout the world. And there remains -- there remain risks of new variants or a fifth wave of increased infections globally. However, based on the business trends we experienced in the first quarter and our early reads into the second quarter, we believe it is appropriate to increase our financial guidance today. Our revised guidance for fiscal 2021 is as follows: Sales of approximately $415 million to $435 million; adjusted EBITDA of approximately $20 million to $30 million; and positive free cash flow. This guidance reflects a level of caution in our outlook for the rest of the year, but we are very pleased by our first quarter results. It is satisfying to see the hard work that our stores, DC, GEC and corporate associates have put in over the past year, start to materialize through our financial results. We are glad that our customer is starting to feel comfortable socializing and gathering outside the house again, and are thankful to be here, to be able to support him wherever and whenever he chooses to shop with us. With that said, I would like to turn it back over to Harvey for some closing thoughts.
Harvey Kanter: Thank you, Peter. As you heard or so we hope both in my remarks and Peter's, we are quite optimistic and energized. We have an incredible team. We strive to be worthy of their esteem, our customers, and to create meaningful returns for shareholders. We believe we have weather, the worst of the storm and challenges, and we believe we have come through a solid financial position. And most of all, we believe we have a strategy to lever -- to leverage the recovery and do engage consumers in what we do best, creating memorable experiences for big and tall guys to look good and feel good. We do that by offering the most extensive and uniquely curated assortment from value price essentials to luxury brands and exclusive designers, both online, in-store serving an underserved customer, the be all and end all place to shop, browse -- excuse me -- and interact, interacting with their friends and our associates, and that is something that cannot be bought. It has to be earned. And with that, we'll take questions.
Operator:  Your first question comes from the line of Eric Beder with SCC Research.
Eric Beder: Good morning. Congratulations on a strong start to the year.
Harvey Kanter: Good morning. Thank you.
Eric Beder: When you look at some of the gains you have here, I know we're trying to segregate how much of it is stimulus, how much of it isn't. Are you seeing shifts in terms of sizing and other pieces that lead you to believe that even a wider group is looking at your product?
Harvey Kanter: Yeah. We've been doing a lot of analysis. I don't know if it's -- the way it's phrased, but the COVID-15 kind of like the Freshmen-15 and the belief that some level of the amount of time people have stayed at home, they have changed sizes. And we're seeing what I would call it's not material, but small shifts in percentages. So 1%, 2%, 3% movement from a -- let's say a size 48 to a 49 or 52, so small movement up, but I would characterize it as material.
Eric Beder: Okay. And when you look going forward and the stores -- the amount of store personnel, are we going to see adjustments kind of increases in the store personnel and potentially at the home office now to support this level of growth?
Harvey Kanter: Yeah. For sure, relative to variable expense and variable payroll in our stores, we have taken two stabs at increasing payroll commensurate with the revenue. We've tried to be very respectful of maintaining social distancing and the way we've talked about our business. And I'll remind you the way we've talked about our business is three priorities for our stores. First is to engage the consumer in meaningful ways, but to maintain social distancing as makes sense. Second, to create the store experience and really visual merchandising that allows the store to basically sell itself because of social distancing and the practices that we have in place. And the third is the ability to ship from stores with each store being a mini warehouse. And we are leveraging the inventory through that. When you add three of those up, the one that is most changing is the velocity of sales. And in that case, we are adding payroll as it makes sense, but we are still trying to maintain some level of social distancing and those elements, and specifically not layering up the store with a lot of more sales associates in payroll, which would create crowding in the store.
Eric Beder: Great. And one more question, and you actually brought it up a little bit. Ship from store has enabled you -- how has it enabled you to lower inventory and how has it helped in the overall sales process, the ability for people to pick up and for you to have, as I said, ship from store directly to the customer?
Harvey Kanter: Yeah. Eric, it has been something which has been in place pre-COVID. And I think what we've seen is a shift in terms of the consumer sentiment to buy online pickup in store or buy online pickup at curbside. And each store has had the capacity and shipped product. The biggest change I think we're seeing is buy online pickup at curbside or in store where the customer is actually coming in. And we're seeing materially greater levels of incremental purchases in addition to double-digit revenue coming from bylined pickup and stored curbside. And we're seeing the growth of that. If you will, the add-on sale as they come in and they forgot something or literally want you to shop and browse at a different level than historically. Historically, it was very low single digits as a percent of revenue. And today, it's running in very low, but still double-digits compared to single digits from before.
Eric Beder: Great. Good luck for the rest of the year.
Harvey Kanter: Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Silverman with AWM Investments.
Alex Silverman: Hey, good morning and congratulations.
Peter Stratton: Good morning and thank you.
Harvey Kanter: Hey, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.
Alex Silverman: Three quick questions. First, what are your -- the 415 to 435, what kind of assumptions are you using for store comps to get to those numbers? And what kind of assumptions are you using for direct growth?
Peter Stratton: Sure. So, Alex, I'll take that one. The assumption for the store comps is that they're still going to be slightly negative, but very close to where they were -- and slightly negative to 2019. But very close to where they were in 2019. But we do expect to see continued growth in comps indirect, which as we mentioned in Q1 outpaced stores significantly, and we expect that that will continue for the rest of the year.
Alex Silverman: Great. Are you finding that the shopper that's coming in is buying one type of product online now that he's coming in and a different product in the store?
Harvey Kanter: No. We're not seeing materially different. The biggest thing we believe, and we continue to see elements of this is where the customer comes into the store is typically shopping or interacting with our associates. And when they understand a brand, they really like, and the sizing, they have a greater comfort level of shopping online. When we see a customer that is uniquely only shopping online, they're more spot on in specifically purchasing an item. And obviously, the trifecta is when they do both. And our best customer, the richest lifetime value, we continue to see as the customer that crosses channels between the app, which is our richest customer by far the browser experience and the store. But relative to specific product, I would not say there's anything material we have yet seen that they are buying online versus in-store or that's material.
Alex Silverman: Got it. That's helpful. And then my last question is, did you find yourself in out-of-stocks in any broad way in some of your stronger geographies with certain items?
Harvey Kanter: We see -- as we mentioned, a material difference in the comps on the Coast versus the middle of the country, but obviously we have a great inventory practice and between our ability to ship from stores to support the net and the ability to move inventory around based on the DC, we have no out-of-stocks that I would acknowledge of any kind that are material.
Alex Silverman: That's pretty amazing that you were able to keep up with surprisingly above plan. So, congratulations on that. Thanks. That's all.
Harvey Kanter: Thanks. Our goal is to continue to evaluate turnover performance, but our hope is that we will actually see and growing level turnover in the mix and more productive use of inventory.
Alex Silverman: Got it. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Harvey Kanter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson.
Michael Baker: Hey, thanks guys. Just two or three for me. One, really following up on that last point. I mean, pretty strong sales here, of course, on a very low inventory and cutting promotions. As demand comes back, do you start to maybe lead into those a little bit? I get -- we want to be efficient with the inventory and the promotions, but it seems to me as if there's an opportunity to maybe start to be a little bit more aggressive to drive even more sales?
Harvey Kanter: Well, quite honestly, we are going to hang on the evolution of the positioning as long as possible. And I would define as long as possible forever, if we can drive sales with a different brand positioning. And we truly believe that if you think about the three elements we spoke about fit and our proprietary fit, which you really can't get elsewhere, we don't just grade product, we actually developed a proprietary fits for every size. Secondarily, the experience of the assortment, which is exclusive in many cases and certainly unique in most cases. And then last but not least, the experience we're creating. And our hope is by bringing marketing to life in different ways and much more confidently in the words we use in the creative we execute and all the variables we've talked about through segmentation and personalization, that we will actually not return even remotely to the level of promotion we've had historically. And we're actually okay, selling less units strategically and a higher average ticket. The belief is that if we live by the great mix we have and experience we're creating unlike traditional retailer, which I think is not a secret to anybody. There's always that a race to the bottom in promotion. We won't return to level of promotion, and then specifically accomplishing greater level of sales if we pull that off, which we truly believe we can, we will continue to push on inventory. The good news is that our inventory management team has really gone very aggressively at and allowed us in fall to accelerate our revenue if the customer comes in and we're managing the risk and reward of those two variables.
Michael Baker: Okay. That makes sense. Well, perhaps a follow-up to that, that would be, the implied EBITDA margin in your guys for this year is just under 6%. As you sort of do more with less, to really to talk about the art of the possible, what could that be over time?
Peter Stratton: Yeah. I think when we put out the guidance for this year, we are -- as I mentioned, we're trying to be cautious with it. We think that the 20 to 30 is absolutely something that's achievable, but it's just really hard to tell what's going to happen in the second half of the year. And I think we're going to be in a great position with inventory. We've certainly got customers coming to our website, coming to our stores. And if we can hang on to that through the end of the year, then yes, there should be -- there could be upside to that EBITDA number, but there's still water that has to pass under the bridge.
Harvey Kanter: Yeah. I think I want to double down on that because I think that one of the things that Peter just said, and I hope you recognize the cautious optimism we have, we have multiple variables that we're literally, as that thing goes, flying the plane while we build it. And this brand's repositioning, which really has been the better part of nine months in this evolution from away from promotion is a big bet. And so, there's a lot of variables that come into that, our ability to drive revenue, grow our margins, et cetera, et cetera, and then inventory. So, I think we're being pretty prudent and pragmatic with what we've provided as guidance and pretty thoughtful about the risk that's inherent in our results.
Michael Baker: Okay. That makes sense. Two more quick ones, if I could, not to hog the phone line here. But I'm intrigued by the Coast being so far behind the rest of the country. I presume that's just because of the timing of reopening. And so, do we think those ramp up over time to look more like the middle part of the country? And then relate to that, are you seeing any slowdown in the middle part of the country as they move past that perhaps initial surge with the reopening?
Peter Stratton: So yes, Mike, your understanding is correct. We saw that surge in the middle part of the country, and it has just continued since beginning of March when we first started seeing it. The Coast, we believe had been just a little bit slower to respond and we link that very much to the tighter restrictions and maybe less comfort with going out in resuming life like some parts of the middle of the country have found. But we do expect that the Coast will catch up.
Michael Baker: Okay. And so, importantly, and they said the middle part of the country isn't seeing the slowdown, which is good. One more little one here, and this is just math and maybe I got it wrong. But if you look at your gross margins and then -- versus two years ago and subtract out the occu -- so there are 190 basis points. I think the occupancy saved 230 or so basis points without imply that the merchandise margins are down versus two years ago or something. Am I missing something in my math there?
Peter Stratton: Yeah. No. the merchandise margins are down just a little bit, and it's primarily due to the shifting mix that we're doing more business indirect. And you've got some added shipping costs. So, it's not a huge amount. I think we had put it in the press release that it was 30 basis points. But that's what the difference is. It's the change in direct sales penetration.
Michael Baker: Right. Okay. All right. I appreciate all the time on the call today. Thank you.
Harvey Kanter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raphi Savitz with RYS Advisors.
Raphi Savitz: Harvey, really, really masterful leadership over the course of the last year. Thank you on behalf of shareholders.
Harvey Kanter: Hey, that very kind of you. I will tell you, let's be really clear. We have thousands -- a couple thousand people doing heroically good work, and their commitment to our customer is pretty amazing. So, really appreciate the comments. But -- it -- my hats off to our group and our employee population. I'm just one of the team helping have them get through this.
Raphi Savitz: Absolutely. And it was great to hear the comments about winning new customers, what can you tell us about that new customer and what have been your learnings there? How are those customers differ than kind of your existing customers? And then I have a follow-up as well.
Harvey Kanter: I'd say at a very high level, they don't seem to be materially different. I think what we're experiencing is, at some level kind of two elements. One, the customer that might've shopped at another retailer, and I won't go through the names, but that might be under more pressure and might not have the in-stocks or the assortments and they're looking elsewhere. And the way we're really winning there is through our digital strategies where the marketing team is really pushing hard on being where the customer is looking. It's not a secret that nearly 90% of consumers start their shopping process today, regardless of channel shopping online. And then -- and when they're doing that, they're either searching for a specific product or big and tall apparel. And we are popping up there in meaningful ways. And regardless of whether it's for store or web, that's where the customers shop today. And I think a lot more customers -- what we see is it as a perfect example, where direct putting in DXL.com that business is not weak, but it's not as strong as search and search for us implies that a customer might have shopped elsewhere and is now looking to -- obviously come to us because they haven't found what they want or the ability to buy it at another retailer. So, relative to how we're getting that customer, I think it's the combination of both our digital transformation strategies as well as some of the duress other retailers have had and relative to what they're buying. We're not actually seeing a materially different -- actually outcome in terms of the assortment. We are seeing some of our private label brands, which are greater value brands, penetrating pretty meaningfully. And the expectation is a lot of the other retailers that I would have referred to might not be carrying Ralph Lauren, Psycho Bunny, Vineyard Vines, and what we would call collections that are somewhat more fluently oriented versus Harbor Bay and Oak Hill and value brands that are part of our mix.
Raphi Savitz: Got it. Okay. And I guess, as you think out about this business over the next few years, let's say, I mean, what aspects of the business or what portions of the business do you ultimately think will create the most shareholder value? And what I'm getting at is it, is it acquiring new customers, telling more visiting customers, is it the merchandising mix? Is it resizing the store fleet? What -- what's really going to move the needle for you guys over the next few years?
Harvey Kanter: I would say other than your last comment of resizing the store fleet, which will not materially move the business, that's a different conversation. I would say, yes, yes and yes. So, our belief is that there is no silver bullet. There's a lot of heavy lifting that we've been doing as we go through this digital transformative process. It's the assortment. It's the experience or creating the store. It's how we market ourselves to customers in a broad way and then a very specific way relative to segmentation with personalization to great productivity. And there is no silver bullet. I think the greatest excitement we have is the ability to demonstrate what I talked about, which is we're there to create the fit, the lifestyle and the relationship with consumers to be an incredible brand and business, not just incredible retailer, not just a big and tall company, but actually being a really sticky retailer that creates belonging community for a customer that is underserved, who we greatly respect, it's our only business. It's not a business as a sideline. It's all we do.
Raphi Savitz: Got it. Well, thank you. Thank you very much, Harvey and congrats yet again.
Harvey Kanter: Thanks again. Appreciate the comments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of .
Harvey Kanter: Hello, Seymour.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello. Congratulations on an incredible quarter and several quick question for you guys. So, was curious you had mentioned that you were closing unproductive stores and was wondering where you guys were where you are and where that's looking like in terms of retail locations.
Peter Stratton: Sure. I'll take that one. So, we are continuing to close unproductive stores, but every store is evaluated on a one for one basis. So each store in the act of the four-wall economics of each store need to be able to carry their own weight. So, I think we started the year at 314 stores. We're down to 300 -- just over 300 today. We will close a few more stores this year and there's some something like 150 stores that have lease expirations or kick-outs over the next two years. Obviously, there are many, many great stores within that 150 number, but there are some that we'll have to take a real hard look at. And the bottom line is that each store needs to be able to carry a . And if the stores cannot be productive, then we're going to think really hard about should those stores be closed.
Unidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thank you. And that’s it. Appreciate all the efforts you guys do.
Peter Stratton: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Goldman, Private Investor.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thanks and -- for taking my call and congratulations on a phenomenal quarter. Keep up the good, work hard work.
Harvey Kanter: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. My question pertains to any buyout offers or merger, has DXL  approached about a possible buyout of the company in the last, let's day 12 to 18 months?
Harvey Kanter: So, I'll take that one. We're -- we have -- we're not engaged in any conversations about that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. But have you ever been approached in the past 12 to 18 months? Is it possible that a company approached you? That's exactly my question. And maybe, obviously, it didn't happen yet, but my question pertains to, has any company or maybe -- buyout from private equity approached you guys about purchasing the entire company?
Harvey Kanter: Joshua, sure. We appreciate that question, but it's just not something we would ever touch base on and comment on.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Understood. Thanks again. And one more follow-up regarding the NASDAQ relisting. So you say that the NASDAQ requires a $4 of consistent -- $4 share price to apply for a relisting?
Peter Stratton: Correct. That's one of the listing requirements is a $4 share price. So, as -- I had mentioned in the comments, we had moved to the OTCQX we're actually quite happy there right now. And with where the stock is right now, we're just -- we're not thinking about it because we're not close to that $4 share price.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. How long does the $4 share price have to be maintained for NASDAQ and to obtain that application or accept it?
Peter Stratton: Yeah. That's a good question. I'm not sure exactly, but it might be like you have to have a 30-day -- 30 days about $4. I don't know exactly what it is.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And if that share price for DXL G would have $4 for a consistent 30 days or more, the company would consider relisting at that point?
Peter Stratton: No. I'm not necessarily saying that. I guess, all I'm saying is that we've been where we are. It's kind of a moot point because of the $4 requirement, but it's something that we're watching and we will consider and have discussions with our board in the future as to whether we want to do that.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much. Continued success. Amazing. Amazing. Have a great day.
Harvey Kanter: Thank you. Operator, we have one last question I believe. And then we'll wrap this.
Operator: Yes. Your final question comes from the line of Seymour Holtzman , Private Investor.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, Harvey. Seymour.
Harvey Kanter: Hey, good morning, Seymour. How are you? We are happy you're on the call.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Great job. Thank you. Somebody told me that -- with the academic, that 40% of the adults have gained, like something like 29 pounds or something like that. Do you ever hear a number like that?
Harvey Kanter: We've definitely seen some published data that, that adults have gained weight. That was my reference to the COVID-15. I don't think we've seen the magnitude that you're referring to. And what we've seen in our results is a small movement in nearly every size up by a couple points, but again not material.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Good. Say -- Peter,  grow. Okay. Go ahead. All right. Thanks. Great job. Okay.
Harvey Kanter: Take care more, Seymour. Thank you so much operator. I think we're done.
Unidentified Analyst: Pleasure. Bye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
