Menderes Akdag: Thank you, Bruce. Welcome and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review the highlights of our financial results. We will compare our fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended on March 31, 2021 to last year's quarter and fiscal year ended on March 31, 2020. For the fourth fiscal quarter ended on March 31, 2021, our sales were $71.7 million compared to sales of $74.3 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of 3.5%. For the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2021, sales were $309.2 million compared to $284.1 million for the prior fiscal year, an increase of 8.8%. The sales for the quarter might have been negatively impacted by colder weather and the demand was pulled forward last year due to the pandemic. The average order value was approximately $93 for the quarter compared to $90 for the same quarter the prior year. For the fourth fiscal quarter, net income was $6.8 million, or $0.34 diluted per share compared to $7 million, or $0.35 diluted per share for the same quarter the prior year, a decrease to net income of 2.7%. For the fiscal year, net income was $30.6 million, or $1.52 diluted per share compared to $25.9 million, or $1.29 diluted per share a year ago, an increase to net income of 18.4%.
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. First, can you speak to those factors that you were mentioning that were impacting the gross margin in the quarter? And how should we be thinking about that from a quarterly progression standpoint on the gross margin front? And also just longer-term, can you help us frame the margin profile of your business and what are some of the factors we should be considering longer-term? Thanks.
Menderes Akdag: Vendors shifted funding to co-op marketing in lieu of discounting products. This negatively impacted gross margins for the quarter, while positively impacting advertising expenses by reducing them. We anticipate this trend is going to continue. So I suggest you look at that operating margin level is that of just gross margin.
Erin Wright: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a bigger picture question on the broader shift to online pet spending as well as the greater pet ownership trends that we saw over the course of the pandemic. I guess, how should we be thinking about the stickiness of that customer base? What are you seeing now as we lap some of that?
Menderes Akdag: The peak last year was the month of April and it looks like the peak this year is going to be the month of May. The weather was warmer last year in the March quarter compared to this year, and also demand was possibly pulled forward last year due to the pandemic. So we'll see what happens. Consumer behavior post-pandemic is somewhat difficult to predict.
Erin Wright: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Lebiedzinski with Sidoti. Your line is open.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. So just wanted to ask if any way for you guys to possibly quantify the impact of the colder weather? What that was? I know, especially the Texas and Midwest got hit pretty hard in February, so just wondering if you could take a stab at just trying to give us a sense as to the magnitude of the weather impact. Maybe what it was you think?
Menderes Akdag: Yes. February was much colder for sure. It's really difficult to – I mean, it gets into to make some assumption to do that. We are not going to do that at this time.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Okay. Yes. I know it's tough, but I would ask it anyway. Okay. And then you talked in the release about – and this is something you said before, but just wanted to see if you guys could expand on what you were looking at as far as fiscal 2022 plans with respect to exploring alternative ways of acquiring new customers and adding value-added services? Can you give us an update on that? And also, as far as your e-commerce platform or what else – what have you done and what needs there still be done to get that fully finalized? Thank you.
Menderes Akdag: We are still in process of exploring for our new revenue sources and new opportunities within pet health and wellness, and alternative ways of acquiring new customers. So we'll give you more information in later part of the year. Our website and app redesign is continuing. It's going to be about June, July before we complete it. It never really gets completed, but at least, the vast majority of it will be completed and we'll do some AV testing to further improve it.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: All right. Thank you, and best of luck.
Menderes Akdag: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from Ben Rose with Battle Road Research. Your line is open.
Ben Rose: Yes. Good morning to both of you.
Menderes Akdag: Good morning.
Ben Rose: Some questions Mendo, around the ask-a-vet feature that, I guess, in the last several months you've been more prominently featuring on the website. I was curious to know if you could speak either quantitatively or qualitatively about the number of sessions that you maybe having with customers, and just your thoughts about this particular feature and potentially expanding its use over the next fiscal year?
Menderes Akdag: I will talk qualitatively that the usages has been increasing and it's going to be more prominent once we complete redesign. We are redesigning the education section of our website. So that has not been completed yet, so it will be more prominent also on the app that it's going to be more prominent. So it should be helping which – helping the consumer and also may help with acquiring customers.
Ben Rose: Okay. And then either for you or Bruce, it looks like the inventory additions this year for the seasonally strongest June quarter were not quite as strong as they were – were not quite as much as they were last year. Could you speak to the health of the supply chain and your ability to get the kind of medications that you need to fulfill customer orders?
Bruce Rosenbloom: As far as inventory balances, our inventory balance was actually higher this year compared to last year. We really didn't see any significant issues in our major lines, major brands. We did note that there was some possible lead time issues on some of the smaller brands, but nothing material to the overall supply chain.
Ben Rose: Okay. That's it from me for now. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, we have no further questions on the audio line. I'll hand it back to the speakers.
Menderes Akdag: Thank you. In fiscal 2022, we will be exploring alternative ways of acquiring customers and adding value-added services. We will continue investing in our e-commerce platform and mobile app to better service our customers. This wraps up today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. Operator, this ends the conference call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."
