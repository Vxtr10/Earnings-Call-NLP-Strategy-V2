Jian He: Thanks, Christian, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased to announce that the initiative we implemented last quarter continued to stabilize and turn our business around as our outlook and long-term growth opportunities gradually improved. Last year in the early stages, these initiatives continue to positively impact our financials and operations, which clearly indicate we are heading in the right direction.While net revenues decreased 27.4% year-over-year to $50.9 million, we improved our gross margin to 34.8% from 29.2% during the same period last year, which was also essentially flat sequentially. Revenue during the quarter was impacted by the seasonality from the Chinese New Year holiday, where our suppliers based in China shut down. Our net loss expanded to $14.1 million in the first quarter of 2019, a large portion of which was the impact of a $5.3 million loss in change in fair value of convertible promissory notes issued to acquire Ezbuy.If we exclude the impact from the convertible promissory notes and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA was $7.9 million in the first quarter of 2019, almost flat when compared with the same period last year, which I believe is more indicative of the progress we have made in turning the business around. These initial results demonstrate the confidence and the dedication of our employees toward building the long-term success of the business and to weathering challenge in order to regain growth momentum. Let me go into a little more detail.First, the strategy of shifting our focus from geography markets towards generating sales in categories that have higher gross margins such as wedding events, fashion, home garden, and sports is generating solid results. We’re also integrating high-quality suppliers from Ezbuy’s network improving supply chain management and reducing procurement cost, which has resulted significant improvement in inventory turnover efficiency.Second, the integration of operation between Ezbuy and LightInTheBox continues to progress well. Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to create new synergies between Ezbuy and LightInTheBox and optimize operational efficiency.Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue also continued to trend down, falling to 18.3% during the quarter with 23% during the same period last year and 20.5% last quarter. We are working with suppliers of product categories that allow more flexible payment terms and are also seeing increase in repeat purchase as we continue to integrate our systems and optimize our product implementation algorithm to recommend more cost-effective products to users.The consolidation of four warehouses into two was completed during the quarter as well. We are also creating more opportunities to consolidate digital marketing, shipping, order fulfillment, and further drive down costs over time. We incurred a onetime charge of approximately $3 million, which was split between G&A and fulfillment expense during the quarter in connection with warehouse and operational team consolidation, which we are confident will improve our overall operational efficiency over the long-term and strengthen our competitive position.I’m very pleased with the progress we have made so far and the direction we are moving forward to implement these initiatives, and a number of others will continue to improve efficiency and fully leverage the synergy between LightInTheBox and Ezbuy.I will now hand the call over to Wenyu to go through the financials for the quarter.
