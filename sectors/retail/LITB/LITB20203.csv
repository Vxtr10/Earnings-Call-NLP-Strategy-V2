Your sales have done extremely well versus previous years. And I think maybe more people are buying online because of COVID. Certainly, that's the case with U.S. race to online retailers. But has there been a product mix that has accounted for increased sales? I mean, have you – your business as your – I guess, the products that you're selling, has it attracted more buyers?

Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And I see that your cash balance, which had grown in the second quarter, declined somewhat in the third. Is that seasonal? Or is there a reason for that since your sales continue to do well?
