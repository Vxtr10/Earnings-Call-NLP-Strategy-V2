Alan Guo: Thanks, Christian, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We are happy to report our second quarter revenue which came in at $78.5 million, representing an increase of 19.6% year-over-year and at the high end of our previous guidance. While also returning to profitability was $0.3 million net income on a non-GAAP basis. Total number of product orders also increased to $1.7 million, a strong rebound of sequential lead and year-over-year. This is our third consecutive quarter of revenue growth on a year-over-year basis and our highest year-over-year growth rate in last two years. I believe these results are direct attribute for to the effectiveness and the persistent execution of our strategy to strengthening supply chain management, improve customer satisfaction, leverage big data enable part of merchandising, expand into emerging markets with more localized product offerings and service solutions and the folks on mobile internet opportunities. Growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in product sales as number of customer in order increased year-over-year particularly in closing choose sports, as well as Toys & Hobbies categories. Geographically European and South American markets, as well as India generated significant growth momentum for us during the quarter. Both our gross margin rates and gross profit increased on a sequential basis. G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue came in at a historical low of 9.1% demonstrating higher level of operating efficiency and business automation. We were impacted by the significantly depreciating British Pound over the past year resulting in unfavorable Forex impact of $1.6 million. We continue to make products available -- accessible to our global customer bases at affordable prices. Our post-sales return and refund rates dropped to a historical low during Q2 as our primary focus remained on continuously improving our supply chain by fine tuning new vendor acquisition practices, implementing stronger product quality control and developing an incentive system which segments suppliers according to product defect rates, on-time fulfillment rates and out-of-stock ratios. This effort has resulted in the continued decrease in post-sales returns and refunds especially with regards to product quality issues demonstrating the effectiveness of our supply chain management initiatives and improving customer satisfaction. As the next step in taking advantage of our stronger supply chain, we have successfully launched a number of OEM and ODM products marketed under the LightInTheBox associated brands in the electronics accessories category such as mobile power banks and cables which are generating exciting initial sales results with higher customer conversion and satisfaction rates. During the quarter we established a new OEM/ODM business units by recruiting expert talents in the OEM/ODM business. We will continue to invest in developing our OEM/ODM business in an effort to turn this business into a growth driver moving forward. We continue to make great progress in increasing our mobile penetration rate. Both user visits and a revenue from mobile platforms hit another historical high during the quarter. This was the direct result of our mobile focus to Facebook marketing initiatives and a number of new features incorporated into our mobile apps such as the improved personalized product recommendation engine. We also made good progresses in expanding to new emerging markets. Our expansion into India is moving rapidly as number of orders there continue to grow. We formed a strategic business partnership with Gati during the quarter to further expand our presence in this rapidly growing market. Gati's customized cross-border logistics solutions between China and India would significantly improve the speed, reliability and cost of delivery of our parcels to India. We officially launched a tailor-made website in Arabic for members of the Gulf Corporation Council which offers targeted products to the region. We also began using videos and online opinion leaders marketing to Russia, Brazil and a number of Mid-East markets especially targeting younger audiences which we believe can potentially generate a higher return on investments. We also developed a more localized payments options in emerging markets by offering younger generations there with offline payments and installments which increase our payment success rate significantly in markets such as Brazil and Russia. We have opened a number of online outlet stores on low cost third-party e-commerce platforms in markets such as Brazil, France and Japan during the quarter which offer selected products tailored to local needs and tastes. In addition, we established multiple specialized shipments routes to Russia with Mid-East and Brazil enabling us to shorten door-to-door delivery time without impacting shipping cost. Overall, we continue to develop new ways to access and serve global customers in different countries and regions with more and more localized approach. In summary, we are pleased with the continued progress we have made during the quarter as we drive revenue growth. Our strategy is clearly beginning to bear fruit. We are confident with our strategy and executional strengths as we seize long-term growth opportunities in global cross border e-commerce. I would now turn the call over to Robin to go through the financials for the quarter.
