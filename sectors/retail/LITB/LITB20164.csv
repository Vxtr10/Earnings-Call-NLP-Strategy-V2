Alan Guo: Thanks, Christian and thank you everyone for joining us today. I am pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter with revenue being at the high-end of our guidance of $93.0 million. More importantly, revenue increased 8.8% year-over-year, a major improvement when compared to the third quarter of 2016. This was a direct result of strong sales during Black Friday and the Christmas holiday season as well as the increased traction that our logistics and warehousing platform and services are getting. We believe, this marks a milestone as we have reversed our top-line trend and are regaining growth momentum again. This demonstrates our persistence and effectiveness of our strategy to strengthen our core business, to improve supply chain management and customer satisfaction, to develop new business growth engines, and to continue to innovate. We continue to persistently execute our strategy to improve our supply chain management and customer satisfaction. Throughout the year, customer complaints about the product quality steadily decreased. We believe improved customer satisfaction leads to revenue growth in a number of key categories including sports and hobbies, home décor customized apparel and wigs and hair extensions. During the quarter, we deployed an upgraded version of an intelligent quality assurance system, which is able to digest a vast amount of data we have collected and with increased precision predict and cash [ph] product quality deficiency prior to being shipped to customers. We have also significantly improved our data-driven merchandising infrastructure. Our IT systems are able to grow [ph] index and understand a wider variety of websites to more precisely identify emerging product trends. We have also leveraged the online behavioral and demographic data of our users to enhance the personalized recommendation engine on our website, direct e-mail and mobile app. We believe that intelligent merchandising using big data has enabled us to gain momentum during the quarter in a number of geographic markets such as the UK, Brazil and Australia. With big data in our corporate DNA, we are naturally progressing towards become a new type of online retail company with sophisticated machine learning and AI tools to make intelligent decisions on almost all aspects of our online retail business such as merchandising, quality assurance and the personal recommendations. We are still in the very early stage of the AI era but we strive to build a long-term competitive advantage as we enter the early stage of the AI adoption lifecycle in a global e-commerce. Our improved supply chain management is creating opportunities for us to introduce more of our OEM products marketed during -- under LightInTheBox associated private label brands beyond the wedding category. This gives us more margin expansion opportunities and allows us to develop new sales channels outside of our website and app. While still early, some of our OEM products in the home décor category have become to gain traction on Amazon platforms globally. As China’s manufacturing industry moves from product imitator to product innovator in many sectors, we are developing ways to connect innovative domestic manufacturers across variety of different categories with the global consumer market under our own brand. The rapid adoption and the penetration of mobile internet, has developed in tandem with the growth of e-commerce in major emerging markets such as India. This has created new opportunities for us, given our knowledge of China e-commerce market developments, as many lessons learned in China can be applied directly or indirectly to India and other emerging markets. We think our strong consumer value propositions such as price and quality, trendy selection and large variety can directly appear to Indian internet users. We are leveraging this experience to develop and/or encompassing solution specifically tailored to the India market as one of our major focuses in 2017. Our logistics and warehousing platform has become an important growth driver. We are exploring value-added service that leverages our overseas warehouse in Europe and North America. Our self-developed and proprietary cloud based ERP system is now officially launched. We are now working with our strategic partner, Zall Development to roll out in their wholesale system. [Ph] We believe that our cloud software will be a very important long-term strategy for us in the years ahead. I am pleased with what we have accomplished this quarter. I am confident in our ability to effectively execute our strategy and look forward to further improving our business and developing new initiatives in 2017. I would now turn the call over to Robin to go through the financials for the quarter.
