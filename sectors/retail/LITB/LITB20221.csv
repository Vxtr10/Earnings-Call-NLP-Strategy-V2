We had a very challenging first quarter of 2022 which is due to the continuous spread of Omicron variant in China. Manufacturing and logistics were delayed as multiple suppliers could not rejoin daily operations where restrictions were imposed in certain regions. But thanks to our effective response mechanism, prevalent business model, and the strong implementation capabilities we were able to take concrete actions to minimize the impact of our supply chain.  Total revenues for the first quarter were 93.8 million compared with 112 million in the second quarter of 2021. Orders were 15.7 million where you can see this at the end of March 2022 and were well received by customers during Q2. Apparel has become our most popular categories and there's a primary one that we have continuous study invested in and located more resource to. During the first quarter revenues from apparel increased by 13.7% year-over-year to 67.2 million representing 71% of total revenue up from 52.8% in the same quarter of 2021. Our gross margin, financially the trends are changing in product mix improving to 15.7% compared with the 46.6% year ago. If you do the apparel sales will make up the majority of total revenues for the full year of 2022. The current challenges we are facing have actually provided us with upside opportunities. Lastly, in response to economic change, similar restructuring and a better coordination of all our capabilities has helped us to withstand a multiple economic uncertainties and the external pressures.

Please be reminded that all numbers reported are in the U.S. dollar. In the first quarter, our total revenue was 93.8 million down 16.3% year-over-year from 112 million due to the pandemic prevention measures impacting the supply chain.
