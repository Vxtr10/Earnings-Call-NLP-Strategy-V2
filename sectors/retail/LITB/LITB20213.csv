Jian He: Thanks, Sophia, and thank you everyone for joining us today.  We had a challenging third quarter with much uncertainty in turbulent markets and the decelerating growth of the global eCommerce industry, as a result of uneven pace of market reopening, and the global supply chain challenges.  Total revenues decreased slightly year-over-year to $98.7 million in the third quarter, while for the first months of 2021 total revenue increased 25.5% year-over-year to $333 million. Gross profit margin improved to 44.5%, from 43.1% in the third quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, we experienced several cost pressures from various markets.  Cost of digital advertising increased much higher than what we anticipated, due to the widening effects of the Apple's App Checking Transparency feature since overall release of iOS 14.5. Since then, the new privacy feature has allowed users to control how their data is used for online advertising. Cost of shipping and delivery continued to raise. The fluctuation in foreign exchange rates also increased our operation costs.  At the same time, Europe countries implement the new VAT rules from July 1, which basically removed the tax exception on small consignments. Meanwhile, since July 16, the new market surveillance regulation has also increased the compliance and the product safety requirements on imported products into the Europe, which has increased cost for manufacturers. As a result, we had to remove un-compliance products from our product listing, and partially raised some of our prices, which impaired our competitiveness in the short term and had a certain negative impact on the top line.  To confront these challenges, we continued to optimize our product mix with a particular focus on the apparel categories because of higher margins compared to standard categories like electronics. With our wide exposure and experience in apparel, we can also respond much quicker to market demand and the fashion change and adjust our strategies to counteract different kinds of uncertainties. In Q3 apparel sales represented 64.5% of total product sales, up by 39.6% from $44.4 million in 2020 Q3 to $61.9 million in 2021 Q3.  The year-over-year growth in apparel sales has been the most successful result from our continuous efforts and investments in R&D. Our indexed research provide the designers and the suppliers with powerful insights on fast changing fashion change, which has actually helped us mitigate the impact from online advertising prices mentioned earlier on. Fashion is one of the largest B2C market segments for the eCommerce industry and also for our platforms we will continue to leverage on the capabilities we have developed to meet our customers' evolving needs and optimize practical decision making down to the design style and even fabric materials.  In conclusion, the overall macroeconomic environment in 2021 has been more challenging, which in turn generated higher requirements for our operations compared to a year ago. Our continuous investment into R&D and ability to optimally balance our apparel product mix to appeal to different markets have all proven to be highly effective in responding to these new challenges. We will continue to achieve better growth momentum through optimizing our platforms to showcase the best curated and most comprehensive variety of quality and trending products sourced globally.  As always, we remain firmly committed to provide our customers with value added service to stand out as a reliable shopping destination. I will now turn the call over to Yuanjun to go through the financial results.
