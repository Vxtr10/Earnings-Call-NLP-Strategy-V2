Today’s conference call is being recorded.

Janet Barth: Thank you, Adrienne, and good afternoon everyone. Joining me on our call today are Steven Temares, Bed Bath & Beyond's Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors; Gene Castagna, Chief Operating Officer; and Sue Lattmann, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements including statements about or references to our internal models and our long-term objectives. All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today. Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as events or circumstances may change after this call. Our earnings press release dated September 21, 2016 can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com. Here are some highlights from our financial results. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.11. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% compared to the prior year period. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 1.2%. Sales from our customer facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% and sales from our stores declined in the low single digit percentage range. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016. Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be within the range we described in our previous earnings press release. I will now turn the call over to Sue who will review our second quarter financial results and our fiscal 2016 key modeling assumptions. Steven will then discuss some of the notable developments relating to our strategic initiatives. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to questions. I’ll now turn the call over to Sue.
Sue Lattmann: Thanks Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start with a review of our second quarter results which include the activity of One Kings Lane from June, 14. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% from the second quarter of last year primarily due to a decrease of approximately 1.2% in comp sales, partially offset by an increase of approximately 1% in non-comp sales including new stores and One Kings Lane. The decrease in comp sales for the quarter was attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. As a reminder, One Kings Lane is excluded from our comp sales calculation and will be until after the anniversary of the purchase. Comp sales from our customer facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% in the second quarter, while our comp sales from our stores declined in the low single digit percentage range. Gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the second quarter of last year. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to in order of magnitude a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of an increase in redemption, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount. Also contributing to a lesser extent as a percentage of net sales was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense which reflects a reduced free shipping threshold of $29 at Bed Bath & Beyond for much of the quarter. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total company gross margin by approximately 12 basis points in the second quarter. SG&A for the second quarter was approximately 28% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an order of magnitude in increase in payroll and payroll related expenses and an increase in technology related expenses including depreciation. The inclusion of One Kings Lane increased total company SG&A expense by approximately 16 basis points in the second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was approximately $18.2 million compared to $25.1 million last year. Approximately $5 million of the decrease resulted from a favorable change in the value of our non qualified deferred compensation plan investment, however that favorable change was offset by an unfavorable change in SG&A and therefore the $5 million reduction in net interest expense did not impact net earnings. The remaining decrease of approximately $2 million in net interest expense for the quarter is the result of the realized loss related to the tender of certain auction rate securities which was included in last year’s second quarter. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 36.3% compared to approximately 38% in the prior year period. The second quarter provisions included net after tax benefit of approximately $2.9 million this year as compared to net after tax cost of $800,000 last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarter. Considering all of this activity net earnings per diluted share were $1.11 for the quarter. Moving onto the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with approximately $661 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion of cost, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the end of the prior year period, due in part to the growth and the inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers. Our newest facility in Lewisville, Texas opened for inbound freight during the second quarter and we are targeting it to begin shipping to customers in October. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and or in good condition. Capital expenditures for the first six months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $185 million and included the following. Enhancements to our digital capabilities, ongoing investments in data analytics, expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system, spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas, and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. We opened six new stores during the second quarter, including three Bed Bath & Beyond stores, two buybuy BABY stores and one Cost Plus World Market Store. Since the end of the quarter, we have opened one Bed Bath & Beyond and one BABY store, both in the Canadian Province of British Columbia and closed one Bed Bath & Beyond store. In addition, our joint venture in Mexico now operates eight stores, including the newest store in Morelia [ph] which opened in July 2016. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $121 million of stock representing about 2.7 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2 billion at the end of the second quarter. In addition, we paid our first quarterly dividend in July, and today our Board of Directors declared another quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016. Now, I’d like to review our planning assumption for fiscal 2016, which incorporate our year-to-date results including One Kings Lane and recent business conditions. We are modeling our cost sales change to be in a range of relatively flat to 1% increase for fiscal 2016 with the net sales increase to be about 125 basis point to 140 basis points higher than the comp sales change. We are modeling gross margin de-leverage including increases in coupon expense and net direct to customer shipping expense as well as the inclusion of our modeled results for One Kings Lane. Even with the inclusion of One Kings Lane, we still expect the 2016 gross margin deleverage to be slightly less than the deleverage of 2015. We are modeling SG&A as a percentage of net sales to deleverage primarily due to payroll and payroll related items including wage increases, further investments in technology, including depreciation as well as the inclusion of our modeled results for One Kings Lane. We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is now estimated to be $75 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid with [ph] 30ish percentage range with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and closed about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concept. Capital expenditures in 2016 continue to plan in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions. As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share has been in the $4.5 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I just discussed which reflect our results through the second quarter, the slight dilution anticipated by our purchase of One Kings Lane and current business trend we continue to model our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share to be in its range. Also as we said before the fourth quarter contribution of net earnings per diluted share to the full year is anticipated to be somewhat stronger than its similar prorata percent to the total year it has been in previous year excluding onetime item due in part to the additional shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and advertising changes. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steven who will share some highlights of the progress we are making to position Bed Bath & Beyond for continued success. Steven?
Steven Temares: Thank you, Sue. As retail continues to evolve, there's been a democratization of shopping enabled by technology and the Internet, which has resulted in an ongoing shift in the way the customer shops. We now have more choices, more transparency and more convenience than ever, all resulting in significant investments in technology and dramatic shifts in the retail landscape highlighted by both new shopping options on one end, and retailer consolidation and closing the website and stores on the other. Over the past several years, in this environment that we have been transforming our company have laid the groundwork for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world class omnichannel retailer. We are making great progress in improving our capabilities everyday. We are taking a systematic and logical approach. We are evolving toward providing a more inspirational and personal shopping experience, with an expanded offering which includes a more differentiated product mix and enhanced services and solutions for our customers. This is to earn the reputation with our customers as the experts for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests. Our investments over the past several years have furthered our foundational ability to do so. The opportunity to do more forward [ph] with our customers have never been greater. At the same time, while we make the investments necessary for our transformation, we remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long term profitability of our company. Today, I will provide an update on some of the developments since our last call. We announced the purchase of One Kings Lane on June 14, about two weeks into the second quarter. As we've said previously, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. We're only a little more than three months into the integration process so it's still early, but things are progressing as expected. We continue to be impressed by the quality and capabilities of the people of One Kings Lane, and we believe that their merchandising expertise and passion for their customers homes will further enhance both our ability to satisfy and our credibility with our customers. Over time, we believe One Kings Lane will provide us an opportunity to improve the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through design services and studio locations. We believe the home furnishing space provides tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment of differentiated product to engage with our customers in a meaningful way and to provide inspiration across various lifestyles. With respect to differentiated product, Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Tree Shops and Bath and Of a Kind have always had a substantial assortment of proprietary and private label product that we continue to improve upon. As Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Harmon Face Values and One Kings Lane, we have also strived to grow a proprietary offering, and as brands are very important to our customers, we have worked to expand our exclusives or first-to-market opportunities for named brand products. Some examples of these merchandising initiatives include proprietary or exclusive brands such as Wamsutta, Olivia and Oliver and ED by Ellen DeGeneres and Bed Bath & Beyond and Wamsutta Baby and Jonathan Adler crafted by Fisher Price and buybuy BABY. We also have a growing line of private label health and beauty care products under the Harmon Face values label. And just this week, One Kings Lane launched the One Kings Lane collection, a line of proprietary furniture and lighting. In addition, we now offer more than 3000 items that could be customized using text, a monogram or personal photos. This personalization service is available on the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY websites, and we will begin to make this available in store through the Beyond store this fall. These items are easy to find under our personalized gifts category and are identified on most shopping pages via an icon or a label that indicates personalization is available. There's an even [Ph] convenient way to create a unique gift or an accent piece for your home. Early customer response has been favorable, and we are continuing to add to the assortment of items that can be personalized. We view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional product differentiation and enable us to do more forward with our customers. We also continue to broaden our merchandise categories online. Some recent examples include other home improvement products such as power tools, kitchen and bath fixtures and silver and gas generators. We also expanded our fitness categories to include treadmill, stationary bikes and other exercise equipments. In the bath department, we have recently increased our assortment of vanity and lighting. And then in our outdoor category we have added camping gear and equipment. Differentiation and constant improvement are paramount for us, and this also applies for the services and solutions we provide. We have added more curated experiences to the Bed Bath & Beyond website such as a new category called, Designer Picks, which offers an inspirational collection of favorite finds from throughout our websites put together by professional designers. Within our shops category, you can find a curated assortment of products and solutions organized by themes such as healthy living, smart innovation and fine linens. We have also added several new lifestyle trends to our Look Love collection. In our Back to College offering this summer, in addition to our popular in-store events and other services such as pack and hold, shop now, ship later and college registry services, we launched Shop With an Expert. This new service enables customers to make an in-store appointment with one of our expert associates to receive personal assistance to get campus ready. Our associates and our website have valuable information regarding thousands of U.S. colleges and in many cases, the details about select dorms on campus. We also produced our first student life catalog that was mailed in June to a targeted distribution of incoming college freshmen. This 36 page catalog, also available digitally, presented a more inspirational view of the products, services and solutions we offer for this important life stage. We were pleased with the results of this catalog and we will continue to evolve our targeted marketing efforts in this area. We have also recently introduced a product expert chat feature on the desktop to select categories on the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites to enhance the online shopping experience and provide customers with an opportunity to interact with one of our expert associates. Currently we have enabled several categories including car seats, strollers, monitors, coffee and tea makers in cookware. So for example, if you were browsing through items in the car seat category, you will be prompted to chat live with one of our expert associates for further assistance. Our customer service representatives engaging in live chat undergo additional training to be able to respond to product specific questions. We have plans to roll additional categories going forward. These new offerings give us an opportunity to elevate our customer service, and as a result create more stickiness with our customers. We know our customers benefit from our expert associates when they shop with us in store. Now we are beginning to translate a differentiated level of service and expertise to the digital experience. As consumer shopping preferences continue to shift to digital, our investments are driving a better omnichannel experience. We have another round of digital upgrades scheduled over the next couple of months. Some examples for Bed Bath & Beyond include extending chat and in store appointment schedule into a mobile website; adding the ability for our customers to browse the entire site including product list and search result pages for a particular item and then further refine their search by what's available in their local store, adding interactive tools to guide our customers to building a registry as well as assisting them in shopping for specific occasions or events; and continue to improve our search experience through enhanced algorithm and data integration. Our goal is create a seamless and more personalized shopping experience and to present our customers with more relevant product recommendations and offers, not just more products but a more relevant experience. This means we need to serve up our offerings in such a way that resonates with our customers. To that end, our marketing capabilities continue to evolve as we further leverage our robust customer database and third party data to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities. For example, our target of lifestyle campaigns for college, new mover, baby and wedding enable us to engage with our customers and present timely and relevant information to them about a specific life stage. These campaigns enhance our ability to be viewed as the expert by communicating the products, services and solutions we offer at a relevant time for the customer. As with everything we do, we strive to improve upon the execution of these campaigns in order to better satisfy our customer, expand our services and achieve greater returns. We have also been refining our existing print advertising program and expanding our specialty print pieces including catalogs to drive engagement and enhance product awareness. So far this year, we have published two catalogs, Outdoor Living and Student Life. We will soon be releasing a third catalog called Welcome Home, which will showcase the depth and breadth of our product expertise in a more inspirational way than we've ever done before. This 84 page catalog will also be available digitally and includes interactive features to drive further engagements. We're really excited about telling our story and furthering our efforts to be known as the experts for the home. We have several other marketing initiatives underway this fall, including the rollout of our new cross concept co-branded credit card, and the testing of some additional aspects of a future loyalty program. Our focus on driving a better omnichannel experience also include advancing the rollout and driving adoption of My Offers, our virtual coupon wallet to additional Bed Bath & Beyond customers as well as to our buybuy BABY customers. We're also evolving our physical channels to further integrate our omnichannel capabilities to enhance the in store customer experience by bringing our products, services and solutions as well as our brand to life. We want the highlight the service components that reflect how customers are utilizing our stores as well as providing more experiential shopping environment through events such as product demonstrations, how to sessions, food samplings and cooking classes. Our growing list of services include being able to reserve an item online and pick it up in store, being able to return online orders to a store, to have product shipped to your home from a store or to schedule an appointment for wedding and baby registry and to shop with an expert for college. In addition, we have introduced new technology in some stores such as a scan-for-more digital tool, which enables a customer to view product images, get product pricing information as well as customer reviews; our interactive catalogs, which enables customers to view a curated assortment of products such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items; and our digital product advisory tools, which enables customers to find what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment of products that best fit their needs. We've also talked previously about our newly located Bed Bath & Beyond stores at Hyannis, Massachusetts and our new, And Than store in Kennesaw, Georgia. These are other examples of how we are revolving our physical footprint by testing and bringing differentiated products, services and solutions including new technologies to our stores. We continue to learn and transition our stores over time. We are set to open our newest retail space in Brooklyn in November. Liberty View Industrial Park is the setting for this unique shopping venue, which will include a Bed Bath & Beyond, a buybuy BABY, a Cost Plus World Market and a Harmon store all under one roof. We're excited to this new iteration of the blending of our physical and digital capabilities as we move towards a more experiential shopping environment. And finally, regarding our newest retail distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As Sue mentioned this new facility opened for inbound freight during the second quarter, and we're targeting to begin shipping to customers in October. Over time, this 800,000 square-foot facility will be able to fulfill orders for all our concepts and improve our overall delivery capabilities. We continue to assess our supply chain network for opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies as we build world class fulfillment capabilities. We remained on course this quarter as we continued to strategically navigate the ever evolving retail landscape. We remain focused on our customers and what we need to do to earn still more relevancy and to become their destination as the experts for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests. It's a transitional time for retail and many retailers including us are experiencing pressure on their operating margins. Despite the fact that we continue to achieve among the highest profit margins in retail we too have experienced downward pressures on our financial results as our transformation continues. During this evolution, we've recognized that we must remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long term profitability of our company while returning value to our shareholders. We have spoken a lot today about differentiation, nowhere is it more important than it is with our people. Our historical success and the success we will achieve in the future is due to our dedicated, hard working, intellectually honest, intellectually curious and never satisfied associates. I'd like to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business. I'll now turn the call back over to Janet so we can move forward with our Q&A portion of our call.
Janet Barth: Thank you, Steven. [Operator Instructions] Adrienne [ph], we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse in line with a question. Please go ahead.
Seth Sigman: Thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon guys. So my first question is on gross margin. The decline this quarter was, I guess less bad relative to prior quarters. The factors you discussed are pretty similar. But I guess the question is which components are getting better sequentially? And then as you think about the current sales trends, how do you think about the promotional levers and perhaps the need to be a little bit more aggressive as we move through the year to achieve the comp guidance that you provided? Thank you.
Sue Lattmann: Hi Seth, it's Sue. So for the second quarter we did see a decrease in merchandised margin and increases in coupon expense and to a lesser extent, direct-to-customer shipping expense in that order. That is consistent with what we also saw for first quarter. So that's been our general trend for what we're seeing. Regarding your second question, if you don't mind repeating it?
Seth Sigman: Yes, I'm just wondering about what promotional levers you have to potentially improve sales as we move through the rest of the year. And I guess, the point was that gross margin the decline this quarter was less bad relative to prior quarters. And is there a need to perhaps get a little bit more aggressive as we head into this important holiday period.
Sue Lattmann: Well regarding the back half and the promo levers, I mean, we do have in for the back half of the year. Our third quarter is anniversaring a slight decline in comp from last year. It was our weakest quarter so we have that. We also have two additional shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and we also have some of the advertising changes we mentioned including our Welcome Home catalog. We're going to continue to work managing the deleverage of our gross margin. We do believe that for the year, the gross margin deleverage will be slightly less than last year, and so that's what we're modeling for the full year.
Steven Temares: And Seth, this is Steve. The only thing I would add to that is that we built into the -- our expectations that it will be a fairly promotional back end of the year. We don't see any indication from other retailers that, that would be different, that our expectation should be different from that.
Gene Castagna: And Seth, this is Gene. Also, as far as different promotional levers we have been testing different shipping thresholds and we are planning on the $29 free shipping threshold that we currently have through the holiday season.
Seth Sigman: Okay, thanks for that color. And then my follow up question is about the SKU expansion that we've seen online. We've certainly seen it in the furniture category, and then I think you talked about a number of categories that you've added online most recently. Can you give us a sense of the inventory commitment required to really grow these businesses? And then also, if you're starting to see any sort of incremental sales lift as a result of this SKU expansion? Thank you.
Steven Temares: Sure. A good deal of the inventory we are adding is vendor [ph] direct, so that's really no additional inventory requirement on our part. And we are seeing stickiness and good performance across many of the categories that we're adding. In the big picture, it's just -- it's incremental. I wouldn't call it significantly meaningful at this point, but we're showing -- it is showing that the customers starting to recognize it, it's appealing to the customer and it's growing.
Seth Sigman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead
Kate McShane: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. My question is centered around more of the dorm business I know Steve you mentioned a little bit about this in your prepared comments. But I just thought specific to the quarter what you saw for the back to college, back to dorm business. And how much did Memorial Day contribute to the second quarter?
Steven Temares: I'll start and Sue could jump in. I think we said that starting with the back and Memorial Day, I said that, what we do call it? That we said it would be...
Sue Lattmann: It was a marginal impact.
Steven Temares: A marginal impact on the first quarter, so a marginal benefit to the second quarter.
Sue Lattmann: That's correct.
Steven Temares: And with Back to College, there's so many ways for us to measure it. There are certain things that indicated good strength. We measured the number of events, the number of attendees at events, the number of high school kids we reached, the number of pack and holds we do. From a sales perspective, it's a little bit more difficult for us to measure it because we peg items each year that we call back to college items, and they don't -- they're not the same necessarily year-to-year. And sometimes even additional categories might drop off or get added year-over-year. So when we looked at the entire quarter, which was relatively flat for us, I think it's fair to say that directionally, you could conclude that our Back to College business is probably similar.
Kate McShane: Okay, great. And my second unrelated question is differentiation was a big focus also prepared comments. And I know you've achieved a lot of differentiation by acquisition whether it be One Kings Lane or Cost Plus, so could you maybe remind us how you are thinking about this acquisitions going forward especially in light of the focus on differentiation?
Sue Lattmann: Sure. While you know in terms of a capital allocation structure, obviously we first invest back into the company. And then second, it would be acquisitions. And so we're constantly looking at things that we did would be beneficial or complement our business. And so that’s where we look at acquisitions. We have done in the past as you've seen recently, One Kings Lane. And it's something that we would consider but it's -- again, it's part of our capital allocation review that we discuss with the board on a regular basis.
Kate McShane: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Please go ahead.
Alan Rifkin: Thank you very much for taking the question. My first question is, as you continue to expand these noncore categories, be it e-commerce or the catalog or spending merchandising categories. Steve, could you maybe tell us how you are managing the risks of getting into these categories with respect to some of your return requirements?
Steven Temares: Yes. Its -- we've had the historically very high return. The Bed Bath business that we developed was a very profitable business. And basically a lot of the things, basically I think everything that we've added of significance has been impacted; you know the margins that we operate under. But when you talk about noncore categories, Alan, we wouldn't all e-commerce our noncore category. E-commerce is a core category for us. I mean again, how we reach the customer, how we do more with the customer, how do we satisfy the customer, the digital experience is part of the entire experience, and we have to be great at it. So, -- but again, the things that we're doing, we do tend to do things incrementally. When you mentioned or when Kate mentioned acquisition, the things that we purchased were always done in a way that we didn't have to – have being able to form [ph] on it. So we always try to test into something, to make it work, to get better at it and to roll it forward. Similarly, all the things that we're doing with these categories that -- they're very -- they're not highly -- they're not risky, in the sense that if it's furniture or home decor, it's vendor direct for the most part. The categories that we are bringing in and how we show them, we do them in a way that it’s not to the detriment of our core categories so it doesn't confuse the customer or doesn’t [indiscernible] the site in a way they can't find what they're looking for. So even as we add categories to our website, it's very important that we improve the left side and our marketing and communication and personalization so that the customer can find what they're looking for. And we're not just adding a bunch of nonsense to customers or noise to a customer. So everything we do is with an eye towards being better in the eyes of the customer and with an eye towards not betting the house on anything but doing things systematically, deductively, logically, testing them out, proving them out and then rolling them forward.
Alan Rifkin: Okay, thank you. And then it appears for the second quarter in a row, you slightly reduced your revenue estimate despite keeping comps in your earnings guidance the same. Can you maybe just tell us where the incremental gains on the EBIT margin is coming from?
Steven Temares: There was a little bit of noise at the end of your question, I'm sorry. What'd you say, Alan?
Operator: Unfortunately, that line disconnected. We'll move on to...
Steven Temares: Well, we want to go on record that it wasn't us.
Operator: And we'll move on to Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
David Vargas: This is David Vargas on for Budd. I think I'll take a stab at that previous question that was asked. Kind of the results this quarter kind of imply that you're keeping -- you're taking down a little bit of your sales guidance for the year, but keeping the EPS window roughly the same even though it is a wide margin. Could you tell us where some of the levers are maybe in the P&L that might help you achieve that, continue to achieve your earnings number, but potentially on a little bit softer top line?
Sue Lattmann: Well, some of the items that we've been discussing is we do have our gross margin that we've talked about how we do things, the deleverage will be slightly less than last year. We have initiatives, ongoing initiatives. We're always trying to optimize our couponing and marketing strategy as we discussed before with our data analytics team. And we'll continue to try to be -- look at the SG&A line items and try to be a focus from a cost cutting initiative. We've always been a cost-conscious organization and ongoing culture of cost reduction.
Steven Temares: And also, I'm not sure but we did maintain our comp guidance
Sue Lattmann: We did maintain our comp guidance of relatively flat to a 1% increase.
Steven Temares: Right. So David, are you talking about the spread between comp and non-comp? What are you talking about?
David Vargas: Yes, exactly. So the results came in a little bit weaker than what we were looking for but keeping – you know we ended up keeping our EPS roughly the same, keeping EPS guidance roughly the same. But I think the results this quarter were a little bit weaker than -- they were weaker than what we were looking for. So I was just wondering where in the P&L there opportunities to take costs out.
Steven Temares: Right. One thing I would say is that they are really fun for us there's been no fundamental change. But that actually this quarter was what we had expected. And so you know whether -- our maintenance of the guidance, I know that you're saying that we were higher than when it came in perhaps. But again, for us there's been no fundamental change to where we are, you know that we expected that foot traffic to be down and sales to be where they are in the stores and basically where sales were digitally to be about where they are. So for us, we're still able to maintain that flat to 1% comp range and can maintain the historical range that we've been during this time of heavy investment for earnings. So I'm not sure but for us again we remain basically on course as we anticipated it.
David Vargas: Okay, thank you very much.
Steven Temares: Thanks, David.
Operator: And the next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simeon Gutman: Hi, good afternoon. It's Simeon Gutman. First question is a follow up to the first question that was asked regarding sort of sales and gross margin. I'll just ask it a little differently. So your gross margin was down a decent amount but a little bit better on a run rate if you take out One Kings Lane. But the top line decelerated, it got a little worse. And curious if there's anything to read into it. The current state of your promotional intensity, if you got less promotional, if there's some delivered strategy where you are seeing, if you take your foot off the promotional lever what type of response you see at the top line?
Steven Temares: You mean, promotional versus last year? First quarter -- or this last quarter versus last year less promotional?
Simeon Gutman: Yes, or look at it sequentially, right? The top line looks like it got a little worse, it decelerated. And the gross margin also got a little better. And so and thinking about if there is anything you are tinkering with on either side or if just this is how the business played out?
Steven Temares: Yes. I mean, the promotional environment is consistent. We're always tinkering and trying things, maybe switching from print to digital -- or trying to become more efficient. Yes, and try and become more efficient but there has been no significant change in the promotional environment last quarter. There are some advertising changes that as Sue described that we have in the third and fourth quarter we have a new catalogue coming out, there’s also some additional advertising changes but nothing -- and they all continuously testing in between store and digital advertising, but there's nothing significantly different.
Simeon Gutman: Okay. And a follow up on One Kings Lane. Can you talk about what you think, what was hurting them or their chances of success as an e-tail business? And then how does that change, like what are you doing differently, why did they become more successful within the Bed Bath portfolio?
Steven Temares: I think they've always been a very successful merchandising organization. We've always admired the way they sell product and tell a story about product. Some of the things that we can add to an organization of that size are just capabilities that a large company has that we can observe within our structure that David have to bear on their own, so sometimes you just get the leverage of scale joining a larger organization like ours.
Operator: And your next question comes from Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Please go ahead.
Alan Rifkin: Thank you very much. I think I got cut off on the middle of my last question. Can you hear me okay?
Steven Temares: We can.
Alan Rifkin: Okay. Thank you. It appears for the second quarter in a row, you've slightly lowered your revenue outlook while maintaining your comp and earnings guidance. I was hoping where the incremental improvement in EBIT margins was coming from that gives you the confidence that you can still hit that earnings range. Thank you.
Steven Temares: The third and fourth quarter?
Sue Lattmann: Yes. So in terms of improvements, we continue to try to manage our expenses and believe that we can achieve that by still maintaining the range the historical range we've previously provided.
Steven Temares: And as Sue said earlier, the third quarter was the quarter last year that we did have a negative comp so slightly weaker. And the fourth quarter this year we do benefit from, I think, it's two additional shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And also the timing on the weekend of when Christmas flows benefits us and some slight shift in our advertising through this -- down again?
Janet Barth: Adrienne?
Operator: [indiscernible] is online.
Janet Barth: We can move on to the next.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And Michael Lasser from UBS.
Michael Lasser: Good evening, thanks for taking my question. It’s on the productivity of your coupons; you think you are seeing the same level of customer response, especially as the world becomes a bit more dynamic and transparent. And are you seeing the same level of return that you might have historically?
Sue Lattmann: Well we did see an increase in coupon usage for the second quarter, with a slight decrease in the average coupon amount. I mean price transparency continues to be prevalent and the coupon helps bridge that gap if there is a difference.
Steven Temares: And the coupons critically -- it's always been an important part of our value proposition, but at the same time we're committed as an organization to smarter, more intelligent marketing, personalized, targeted, being more meaningful and being more efficient and optimizing that over time as well. So it's -- I think when you go back to question in the '08 and '09 when people became much more cost conscious, became aware of pricing when things started to go down this track, you know that coupon is clearly and has been strongly associated – strongly associated what has been very important, but really we need to be working and we are working on becoming a lot more intelligent about our marketing and making it much more personalized.
Michael Lasser: But do you think that the consumer is responding the same way to your coupon that they have in the past?
Steven Temares: You know while I think that we had as Sue said, I guess in this last quarter, that the coupon redemption was actually up. So at the same time I think that people aggregate, they gain intelligence about it over time in terms of how they aggregate them, how they use them so that does change. And I think what other competitors do and availability of coupons impacts, things as well and their marketing. So, but I don’t think if you're looking for a thesis that has become a lot less responsive or a lot more responsive, we cannot support that thesis.
Michael Lasser: Okay, and you are expecting your comps to get better over the next few quarters in the fourth quarter, due in part to more days between Christmas than -- Thanksgiving, Christmas. So do you think that's going to have an equal impact on your stores as it will online or do you expect one channel to get better? I'm just trying to understand like where do you expect to see the improvement business over the next couple of quarters?
Steven Temares: Good question. It's funny because it's all integrated for us. So a customer goes into a store and whether they are standing and there are buying online on their phone today, so customers researching online and going into its store. So it bleeds in many different ways, so it's not easy to predict but we would expect and we would be modeling that incrementally both should improve. So again, being up against a weaker third quarter is, in both cases, across our businesses and the additional day’s benefits whatever channel you shop through and whatever concept you are shopping with. So we should see it incrementally across -- everywhere we do business.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher Horvers: Thanks, good evening. So a couple of questions. Is the $29 freight ship threshold; is that going to be a permanent change? And then following up on the gross margin question. So if you take out One Kings Lane, the gross margin decline did moderate, so curious why that happened. Is it that you're becoming more efficient in terms of the distribution aspect? Is marketing some sort of marketing efficiency driving that? Are investments moderating that's impacting cost of goods? From a big picture perspective, I think the market's trying to figure out when that gross margin rate might flatten out and -- is there something going on underneath that's driving that moderation that you could talk about?
Steven Temares: Well, I'll take the first part and you'll take the gross margin. The $29 nothing is permanent, right? I guess, death is permanent. But I’m not even sure are, but the $29 is something that we've planned now through to the holiday but we have to be nimble enough to respond to competitive environment and into things that we learn and see in this time frame. But we are modeling and planning on that through the holiday season. But again that -- so we would not term that as permanent. For the margin question, I'll leave that for Sue.
Sue Lattmann: Sure. So to your point, when you exclude the 12 basis points there was a little bit of improvement I guess in the deleverage. But essentially, we're always looking to improve any aspects within gross margin, the merchandise margin as well as we discussed earlier even though we have increases in coupon expense, we are looking to optimize through coupon strategy to how to improve that. We're always focusing on strengthening our deals with our vendors and the additional differentiated product that helps to mitigate margin erosion as well.
Gene Castagna: And as I -- earlier in our comments, we had anticipated the pace of gross margin deleverage to be reduced and less than last year.
Operator: And the next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Brian Nagel: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to just dive a little bit deeper into the comment you made, I guess, you made previously about some forthcoming moderation in your investment spend. So the question out there is maybe remind us again of the timing of that, discussion of the magnitude how much -- and I think most of the CapEx that you were discussing. And what investments are you making now that are beginning to wind down? Thanks.
Sue Lattmann: So you're right, Brian, we did -- we had talked about how 2016 is a peak in terms of the CapEx spend for us and that we anticipate coming off that after 2016. One of the items that we've called out for 2016 and previous years is our POS, which we do believe that will not be as anniversaring as much as it has been is a peak for 2016. So there are items that come on and there's items that come off, but POS is one of them that I could call out.
Janet Barth: And also, Dave, the new Lewisville distribution facility that we mentioned on earlier that is just opening for inbound freight, this past quarter but will start opening for outbound freight next month. So that's another callout that we made earlier in the year in terms of the part of the CapEx spend for the year. As you recall, it's 800,000-square foot facility. So I think its [indiscernible] again.
Steven Temares: And I think as we said on the last call, we will have large investments in the future whether we open up future distribution centers, but we also expanded our cost center. We just had a lot of large expenditures all hit in this year. And we don't anticipate at least for the foreseeable future that we'll have all those large investments like that all hit within one year.
Brian Nagel: So is the move online towards the omnichannel model, does that keep the investment -- I mean, you talked about this moderation coming this year to next year, but does the online initiative basically keep investment spending higher that otherwise normally would be?
Steven Temares: I guess what you're asking Brian is they're a new normal, so it's dependent upon technology. Things change so quickly. We're seeing literally hundreds of vendors that we didn't see three years ago with opportunities of things where we might want to try or do we look at. So I think the best -- that's right to think that we and there's more opportunity, more things that are possible and things that we would be choosing among than historically when you are opening up stores and that the world you lived in and the things that you are doing, whether it be in logistics or real estate or construction office to a point and the things that you are doing were much more predictable. And again, they were stayed whereas the things that we looking at today are rapidly changing. So I think there is a new normal but to what Sue and Gene were saying, I mean for the foreseeable future is that we do see what's on the horizon, a short term horizon and that we see the spend coming down, but I do think there is a new normal.
Operator: And the next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Daniel Binder: Yes, thank you. Just following up on that question I mean, versus when you started this investment phase, do you foresee it being longer and deeper as you respond to new competitive threats? And I know you commented on the CapEx, but as you think about the gross margin investment, the expense side and the P&L, is that something that you think peaks this year as well or do we need more time?
Sue Lattmann: I would say that we need more time. I mean, the pressures on gross margin continue to be an aid to all of retail as retail's just going through a transition, and we've been going through a period of investment for sometime.
Gene Castagna: And I would say a lot of the things we're investing in today we wouldn't have foreseen years ago. There's a lot of opportunities and this is our forecast for now and if we think at least for next year or so, we should be in that position. But we're always going to be looking at opportunities to improve the company and improve our future. And like Steve said, there's a lot more to review and decide and invest than they have historically been moving to simply opening stores.
Steven Temares: And hopefully with the new POS system, the back end and the front end put into place for the Web businesses, there’s been a lot of the big expenditures, hopefully the things that we'll be building on won't be as expensive as putting them in place initially.
Daniel Binder: And then with regard to the new categories, I know you had some questions on the call about it. I'm just curious, you are obviously adding stuff here to have a bigger presence with potentially a greater share wallet with the customer but, what -- how do you think about your position in the marketplace. What's Bed Bath's angle? Is it going to be price on these new items? Is it the assortment? Is it content? And how do you get recognition for those categories? I mean, I just did a quick search on some of the items you mentioned, Bed Bath doesn't immediately come up as the top place to buy those items so I'm just kind of curious what the strategy is there and where you see yourself providing some sort of a competitive advantage.
Steven Temares: Well you're right, Dan. For the moment really there's been little marketing around most of it, and it will be an effort to be better known for these areas. But I think it really starts with us doubling down being viewed as the expert for the customer’s home and everything home-related. And if we start there and do a good enough job there with differentiated product with really getting better services and solutions in place then it opens up the doors for these other things. And the other -- the further you move from the trunk of the tree out to the branches, the more difficult it is to tell the story. But when we are adding lightning and furniture and those type of categories, those will be easier for us. But you know for someone to look like for the chicken coup that will be less likely. But again it is -- so -- but we are not in a rush to make a mistake. We have to do it right and be diligent about it, we also have to vet [ph] all these vendors that have vendored [ph] direct to make sure that they could shift, they could ship on time that their product is what they say it is, that the customer's experience are good before we want to be out there pounding our chest that we have it, but overtime if we execute against the core business and continue to earn the reputation and the credibility with the customer growing to -- these other aspects of the business will be a marketing effort but a lot more easily done, but it's a great question, Dan.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Thomas: Yes, thank you for taking my questions. A follow up on some of the expenses for this year, the $0.23 for payroll I believe you reiterated that number when you reported the first quarter. Is that number still looking good for this year in terms of an expense? And as we think about some of the growing areas that wage pressure is emerging, it does appear from many retailers that it's trickling into 2017 as well. How are you thinking about payroll outlook for next year at this point? Thank you.
Sue Lattmann: Hi, Brad, yes. We did call out in order of magnitude payroll related expenses for Q2 that’s similar to the increase that we saw in Q1 as well. And we believe payroll and wage pressure will continue. We're not immune to it; it's impacting our broader workforce including all of retail. It’s also something that we seeing as you pointed out seeing a more than one year impact that there are scheduled increases depending upon the state or the city or the county for multiple years out. So we'll need to incorporate that as we make our plans going out and provide that communication in the future. But we do see continued wage pressure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Peter Benedict from Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Benedict: Hey guys thanks for continuing on with the Q&A here. You gave the gross margin and SG&A impacts from One Kings Lane. Could you give us a sense for what maybe the sales contribution was in second quarter?
Sue Lattmann: You know I think that is not something that we directly provided although I'm sure with some of the communication and information that we have you could make some assumptions from there. That's probably not the direct answer and something we could consider in the future. But I do believe, with some of the assumptions we provide or some of the metrics we provided you can make some relative assumptions but overall, it's not material the entire sales activity for One Kings Lane for the quarter is not material.
Steven Temares: It's a small part of the overall business.
Peter Benedict: Fair enough. Thank you. And I guess, can you help us what drove the change in your view about the gap between total sales and comp growth if you narrow that versus your prior view in the first quarter, what drove that change? Thank you.
Sue Lattmann: Yes. There's a multitude of reasons for assumption changes in there. We’ve updated it for Q2 actual. It reflects modeling changes for non-comp businesses such as Linen Holdings and One Kings Lane. It reflects changes in timing for new store openings and closes and reflects changes and shipping in sales return estimates. So it’s a multitude of items in there and we'll continue to update that as the year progresses.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Michael Baker: Thanks. So we talked a lot about investments and CapEx peaking. I guess, this was kind of asked, but I'll ask it again more directly. Should we expect a similar trajectory in terms of investments that more directly impact the P&L, i.e., cost of goods sold or SG&A? And then I guess the follow up to that and related to that is, you have been saying for a while that earnings would be in that range of $4.50 to just over $5 during this heavy investment phase, and then it sounds like this could be the peak year of that heavy investment phase. So is the proper conclusion that earnings will break out of that range next year? Thanks.
Sue Lattmann: Right now, we're working on our fiscal 2016 year. And when you get closer to fiscal 2017, we'll provide information on where we think that model in EPS range will look like for next year. And if you wouldn't mind repeating the first part of your question, I believe it was investments in cost of goods sales -- cost of goods sold and SG&A for the year.
Michael Baker: Yes. I mean, -- I'll just ask it more simply. This year will be the peak year of investments on CapEx. Will also be the peak year in investments that impact the P&L more directly?
Steven Temares: As in pricing? I'm not sure I understand.
Michael Baker: SG&A, -- expect a lot of...
Sue Lattmann: We are going to continue investing in payroll as we had mentioned, we do have wage increases and we're committed to providing superior customer service in our stores. And so the technology expense also that are associated with our strategic initiatives we'll continue to see some of that as well. It depends on our mix of strategic initiatives as we roll forward in terms of IT projects.
Michael Baker: Right. I guess that will suffice.
Steven Temares: I'm sorry, Mike go ahead.
Michael Baker: I guess that’s the point of the question right there, is that the CapEx investment is peaking, can we say that that technology investment peaks this year as well, or are you not saying that?
Sue Lattmann: Well, in terms of CapEx, if our -- if we invest less in CapEx in future years, so less CapEx you will have over time, you will have less depreciation associated with that's what you're asking about. And considering all your existing assets remaining the same, you would see over time a benefit in the P&L with less depreciation.
Michael Baker: Okay, okay, understood. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Matthew Fassler: Thanks a lot. A couple of quick ones. If you think about One Kings Lane and its impact on the second quarter, were there any transaction costs that may have inflated the SG&A on a one time basis that won't recur going forward?
Sue Lattmann: No.
Steven Temares: Nothing significant.
Gene Castagna: Although we would say, Matt is that a lot of the benefits that derive the closing of the San Francisco offices system conversion and a lot of the benefits obviously we haven't begun to see yet.
Matthew Fassler: Understood. And then secondly, your inventory growth was subdued relative to what you'd seen over the past few quarters, which I guess is good news to the extent that the environment is challenging. Can you talk about what brought the inventory levels down? Do you feel like you're in stock where you need to be particularly as you broaden out the assortment and as you presumably took on some inventory from One Kings Lane?
Sue Lattmann: Yes, we took on some inventory for One Kings Lane. We also took on a little inventory related to the opening of the Lewisville, Texas facility we talked about. Our inventories, we continue to manage them. We're obviously getting ready for holiday and so we think they're in good shape and they're going to continue to be tailored to meet customer demand.
Steven Temares: And then also going forward, Matt you still look at that we've said it a few times, the inventory we're adding for the furniture and home decor business, that's heavy BBC. And then if you go into our Hyannis store, the Bed Bath, the new store there, I think you'll see an example of some opportunities to what we call store of the future, which is to show product not carried and make it available to the customer and reduce inventory carrying costs.
Matthew Fassler: Great. Thanks so much Steve.
Steven Temares: You’re welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Seth Basham: Good evening and thanks for taking my question. My question revolves around differentiated products when you spoke about in this call. If you could give us a sense across the enterprise what percentage of your sales mix is from proprietary or exclusive product that will be really helpful?
Steven Temares: Here's the answer. The answer is that we don't have a target. So -- but we do have the objective to drive differentiated product. You probably heard it from us before and everybody will cringe, but differentiated product is life and death to us. So it really is -- so if you look at Bed Bath & Beyond, which does depend a lot on branded products, we work on lead time first to market with product, but we've worked very hard on if you look at artisanal or you look at bedding or you look at what we've done with Wamsutta, very important. You look at concepts like Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Trees Shop and Bath, largely proprietary, significant proprietary projects -- products. If you look at One Kings Lane and that we've now launched this private-label program, if you look across Harmon, where we measure costs and growing our private-label product. In each of the categories that we do business in, it's essential for us to drive differentiated product and to, over time, be known for it. So but we don't set a goal because it goes down to what we're able to execute and customer acceptance of it. So in certain categories, things that you have applauded plug, it's very difficult for us to drive a lot of differentiated product. So I can't answer the question with a percentage or a number, but I can tell you that it's larger in certain businesses, smaller in others and being driven passionately across all.
Operator: That completes the question and answer session. I'll now turn the call back over for closing remarks.
Janet Barth: Thank you, Adrienne and thank you all for joining us on the call today. We look forward to having you join us on our next quarterly earnings call which is scheduled for December 21, 2016. Have a good night.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."
