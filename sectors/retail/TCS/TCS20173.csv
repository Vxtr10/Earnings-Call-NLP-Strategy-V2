Melissa Reiff: Thanks, Shannon, and we appreciate everyone joining our call today. I'd like to begin by showing the highlights of our fiscal Q3 performance followed by an update on a few of our strategic priorities. Jodi will then give you a more detailed overview of our financial results for Q3 and discuss our outlook. Overall net sales for the third quarter of fiscal '17 were 223 million, up 3.1% compared to the prior year period. This was driven by new store sales and offset slightly by a decrease in comp store sales of two tenth of a point. Elfa third-party sales were up 10.5% in U.S. dollars primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 8.3%. Specific to our comp store sales results we did fall short of our plan in Q3 largely due to soft sales in our holiday department which caused us approximately a 4-percentage point of comp store sales during the quarter. We saw continued positive comp store sales contribution from our Custom Closets business, contributing 60 basis points of Q3 comp store sales performance and this is in spite the shift of one Elfa sale selling day out of fiscal Q3 and into fiscal Q4. We were also pleased with the improvement in our other product categories outside of holiday departments' as our broad sales revitalization initiative that span merchandizing, marketing, store operations and customer experience all continue to positively impact our business. It's important to know that since Q3 is our only quarter with holiday sales, our holiday departments typically have a notable impact to that quarter sales, however on an annual basis it's generally a small percentage of our total sales that come from our holiday department. In addition, after analyzing the 2016 holiday season we made the decision to head into this season in 2017 with the more conservative inventory ownership and we're successful in clearing through our inventory without a negative impact to our gross margin; in fact, despite our soft holiday sales we delivered healthy gross margins overall in Q3 and ended the quarter in good shape from an inventory perspective. While we recognized we may not be a call it, traditional holiday gift destination, we remain committed to maximizing our sales during the holiday season, we've a team specifically focused on speaking with our customers, analyzing our great data, reviewing our product assortment and making recommendations with a goal of improving our holiday results next year. Let's shift gears now to what went well in Q3. Our strategic focus on our core competency of Customs Closets continues to generate positive results for us as evidenced by the 60 basis points comp store sales contributions on this business in Q3. We kicked off our annual Elfa sale on December 21 and we're pleased with our important start to this big annual event. And as a reminder, Elfa sale runs through February 28 with the exact same number of Elfa sale days in the campaign this year as last year. The improvement we've been discussing for several quarter now and our other product categories with the exception of holiday department continue in fiscal Q3 achieving a slight positive comp store sales contribution. We again delivered a strong quarter of e-commerce performance driven by our expanded digital efforts, web generated sales were up 17.7% including quick and pick up sales and 21.7% for online direct to customer sales only. And as we’ve discussed before these sales are not operating margin diluted for us, so we remain relatively agnostic to the channel in which we fulfill our customers order. Our primary focus of course is to ensure that we’re meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations in any channel they shop. And as I said and as we communicated in our press release we have seen a strong start to annual Elfa sale that has continued into the fiscal fourth quarter and expect comp store sales in the fourth quarter to improve from the third quarter as reflected in our implied fourth quarter comp store sales outlook, a flat to up in the low single digit range. Q3 profitability was driven by a 50 basis points gross margin improvement due impart to the anticipated cost of goods project benefit, which began to be realize in Q3. Slightly softer sales, improving gross margin and continued discipline with our SG&A despite a headwind from the timing of certain marketing and technology expenses that we flagged last quarter, resulted in over a 10% increase in operating income year-over-year. With higher interest expense of approximately $0.04 per share adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.11 which was towards the lower end of our Q3 expectations and compared to $0.11 in Q3 2016. I'm really pleased with the progress against our strategic priorities, we had made many changes throughout our business and our organization has responded positively with a more targeted focus and speed of decision making. We've a clear understanding of our vision, our purpose and the direction we’re heading. To share a few highlights with regards to new stores, we opened two new stores during Q3, Livingston, New Jersey and Staten Island, New York and relocated our Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts store completing all planned fiscal 2017 new store openings and the one relocation. Fiscal 2017 also included the opening of our Cleveland store and our Albuquerque, New Mexico which occurred in five quarters. Our 18,000 square feet in Albuquerque, New Mexico continue to perform well which we believe is a positive indicator for what smaller store could mean for us. One of the location, that we have committed to open in fiscal 2018 will be a smaller size store like Albuquerque and will be sharing [full] new store and relocation activities for 2018 on our May earnings call. And as we previously discussed we’re deepen the process that redesigning our Dallas flagship store, construction began last month and we anticipate the store to remain open during this work with the completion projection in the June of 2018. This is very exciting for us as we will test and learn and tweak along the way and the appropriate time apply our learnings to existing stores, from product assortment, visual merchandizing technology and training prospective as well as anything else we can learn to maximize the customer experience. And speaking of product assortment, our focus on Custom Closets continues to generate positive results and our new Elfa product introductions from June continue to be well received by our customers. Product innovation with Elfa remains a priority. Our President and Chief Merchant Sharon Tindell is heavily focused on our Custom Closets business and is leading a specific team to ensure our pipeline of new Elfa products remains full. In Q3 we continue to work on our pricing optimization project that we plan to continue for the rest of the fiscal 2017 and into early 2018. We're eager to leverage the many insights this project will generate and have already begun testing in some stores. Again, our goal is to use our great data to ensure our refill pricing is maximizing growth profit dollars in our business. On customer acquisition and marketing our media mix model and subsequent increased allocation to digital spin are contributing positively to our sales. We continue to shift our allocation of marketing dollars from traditional to digital in order to optimize our marketing spend and ensure we are allocating our dollars where we can achieve maximum returns. And to further increase sales from our paid media we are testing channel exclusive offers. Our POP! program has now reached over 5.8 million POP! starts to further increase the purchase frequency of our POP! starts we've developed a comprehensive strategy that takes into consideration our customers journey with the Container Store and leverages advance analytics to identify the next best action to increase purchase frequency at each stage of the customers journey. We plan to focus on a multi touch, multi-channel direct marketing strategy to further engage or educate our customers about our brand in order to drive additional purchases. We plan to test several pilot campaigns in the coming months across various stages of the customers' journey. In addition, we've developed an offer optimization model to further increase the redemption rate from our targeted offers. We've tested some of the activities during Q3 and saw a notable lift in redemption rates. And our team, as previously mentioned we lifted our wage freeze last September and updated our compensation and performance review process to ensure we are utilizing a best in class approach. We also have been busy assessing the talents of our leadership teams to not only ensure we're maximizing our existing talent and focus but to also identify areas where we should add talent. In December we did just that with the addition of our new EVP of Strategy in Analytics, Gretchen Ganc has been a senior executive of this area and much larger retailer, and began her career by spending six years at bank consulting. We're very fortunate to have extensive and good data at our company and believe we'll be able to effectively use that data even more to drive our business forward under Gretchen's leadership and expertise. Lastly with regard to the Tax Act, like all retailers we are pleased with the recent actions around tax reform. We currently expect to reinvest a good portion of our tax savings in our business specifically around strategic priorities which may include marketing, technology and our employees. We'll provide more information when we release our Q4 results in May. So, in summary we're pleased with the progress being laid in our business including around our key strategic priorities, given our year-to-date performance as well as the impact of the Tax Act, we've narrowed our outlook ranges for fiscal 2017 and look forward to building on this progress as we close out the year. Now I'd hand it over to Jodi to go through in more detail on our financial results and our outlook.
Jodi Taylor: Thank you, Melissa, and good afternoon everyone. Today I'll be reviewing our third quarter fiscal 2017 results and then discussing our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. For the three months ended December 30, 2017 our consolidated net sales were 223 million up 3.1% compared to the prior year period. Sales for the Container Store retail business were up 2.4% to 203.9 million driven by new store sales, offset by a slight decrease in comp store sales of 0.2%. As Melissa discussed, software sales in our holiday department combined with the shift of one Elfa sale, selling day from fiscal Q3 into fiscal Q4 with the primary drivers of the comp store sales decline versus Q2. Custom Closets continue to be a positive contributor to our comp store sales generating 60 basis points of our third quarter comp despite the just mentioned one Elfa selling day shift from Q3 into Q4. We ended the quarter with 90 stores and approximately 2.2 million of gross square footage as compared to 86 stores and approximately 2.1 million of gross square footage at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Now turning to Elfa International AB. Elfa's third-party net sales were 19.1 million up 10.5% compared to the prior -- to the same period a year ago with a positive impact from foreign currency translation of 8.3% as well as growth primarily in Russia. Moving on to profitability. In the third quarter, consolidated gross profit dollars were up 3.9% to $130.6 million, consolidated gross margin increase 50 basis points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the benefits from our cost to goods sold project, which was a key component of our optimization plans. Gross margin at The Container Store retail business was up 110 basis points, reflecting lower cost to good associated with the optimization plan and the benefit of favorable foreign exchange contracts that were partially offset by higher cost of goods associated with our installation business. The 160 basis points decline in Elfa gross margins was primarily due to higher direct material cost. As a percentage of net sales, consolidated SG&A increased 30 basis points to 46.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior year period. Primarily due to the timing of marketing and technology expenses as well as deleveraging of occupancy cost due to the slight comp store sales decline partially offset by ongoing savings and efficiency efforts. As we mentioned last quarter, we experienced a timing shift for certain marketing and technology expenses that resulted in an approximate 55 basis points shift into Q3 year-over-year with an expected benefit due to the timing shift in Q4. New store pre-opening expenses decrease by approximately 1 million to 1.9 million in the third quarter as we opened stores inclusive of one relocation in the third quarter this year, compared to four store openings in the prior year period. Net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $7.3 million, up 3.2% or approximately $0.04 of EPS from the prior year period due to the refinancing of our term loan obligation completed in Q2. The effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 330% compared to 39.7% in the third quarter of 2016. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the initial estimated impacted of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was acted toward the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We recorded an estimate of the impact of the lowest federal tax rates on our deferred tax balances, since when the net deferred tax liability position this resulted in an approximately 24.3 million tax benefit during the quarter. We're currently enable to calculate a reasonable estimate of the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that we will record in a future period once available. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was 28.4 million or $0.59 per share inclusive of 57 per share provisional benefit related to the tax act, as compared to net income of 5.1 million or $0.11 per share in the third quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, excluding the $0.50 per share provisional benefit related to the Tax Act among other items, our adjusted net income of 5.1 million or $0.11 per share. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $22.7 million in cash, 314.1 million in outstanding borrowings net of deferred finance costs which was down 24.2 million from the end of the third quarter last year and combined availability on revolving credit facilities and cash on hand of approximately 102.6 million. We ended the quarter with inventory of approximately 1.3% reflecting increase in stores opened from 86 in the third quarter of 2016 to 90 at the end of third quarter of 2017. On a per-store basis, inventory levels at TCS were down 4.2%, we had a clean inventory position coming out of the holidays. With regards to our outlook for fiscal 2017 factoring in our year-to-date results as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter including the Tax Act we're narrowing our outlook. We now expect fiscal 2017 consolidated sales to be 850 million to 860 million and comp store sales to be flat to up 1%. We continue to expect TCS and consolidated operating margin improvement driven by our SG&A savings and efficiency program as well as the impact of our optimization plan that we discussed this year. Given the impact of the Tax Act we now expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '17 to be approximately negative 170%, excluding the impact of the provisional benefit recorded as a result of the Tax Act in the third quarter of fiscal '17 and the tax impact of adjustments to net income, the fiscal 2017 effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 35%. The estimated 35% range does not include any impact related to the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings to be recorded in the future period as we are not yet able to reasonably estimate that amount. Factoring our year-to-date results through Q3, we've increased and narrowed our fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS to range from $0.60 to $0.66 versus the previously expected $0.11 to $0.22 and we now expect fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS to range from $0.31 to $0.37 compared to our prior outlook of $0.30 to $0.41. EPS is still based on 49 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We continue to expect CapEx for the year of approximately 30 million. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect an increase in operating profit dollars of approximately 30% to 50% driven by ongoing improvement in gross margin due to the optimization plan and flat to slight leverage in SG&A. Our narrowed full year comp store sales outlook implies Q4 comp store sales of flat to up in the low single-digit range. We continue to expect to earn approximately two thirds of our adjusted EPS in Q4. Interest expense is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.04 per share year-over-year, as we saw in Q3. And our effective tax rate for Q4 is projected to be approximately 35% as we anticipate a benefit from the Tax Act in Q4 of approximately $0.01 per share. The projected tax rate for Q4 also does not include any provisional amounts for one-time transition taxes on foreign earnings to be recorded in a future period. From fiscal '18 forward our current best estimate of an effective tax rate is the high 20% range as we take into consideration the 21% federal tax rate as well as partial offsets such as executive compensation limits and international taxes. As Mellissa mentioned we expect to reinvest in good portion of these tax savings to further our strategic priorities. We'll share more information on our fourth quarter call in May when we will provide our fiscal 2018 outlook. So, in summary, while our holiday department sales were soft, continued growth of our important custom business and improvement in our other product categories outside of holiday combined with strong gross margins and disciplined SG&A were our bright spots in our fiscal third quarter. We remain encouraged by the progress being made across all our key strategic priorities and look forward to updating you again on our year end call in May. Thank you. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Omar if we can open the line for your questions. Omar.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Forbes: Maybe you can start, you can expand on the performance of holiday sales during the quarter, in a kind of a couple of quick questions that come up really how broad based was the other performance, if you could touch on the categories, what percentage of sales this holiday represents in the third quarter. And then what was the performance of the category last year, I think you had a difficult compare in the first quarter of this fiscal year, was there also difficult fair this year or really any context on what transpired here.
Jodi Taylor: Sure, first of all as far as the first part of your question Steve, let me talk about the percentage of sales that holidays represent just to make sure we’re scaling in. So, for us within the quarter, you heard us talk to generalities but to be a little bit more specific holidays represent around 20% of our total sales in Q3. And then if you go obviously into the full year, it becomes single digit percentages. So, it's really only meaningful to us in our fiscal Q3 period since for us, fiscal Q3 is the months of October, November and December. So, it's an isolated time frame, number one. Number two, in terms of looking across holiday for us, we saw declines across all of our holiday categories, the three departments that we specifically have that we develop our holiday products into. So, it really wasn’t any specific category that drove the decline per se, it was more broad. And then you're correct, that’s why Melissa referred to it in her script, I don’t know if you want to speak more to Melissa, a bit, we have seen a pressure in holiday sales for few years now and that is why we're very devoted to our team really digging in to our great data and talking to customers to make sure we're reacting appropriately.
Melissa Reiff: Exactly Jodi and Steve don’t forget it, it did contribute one full point of comp store sales in a negative way, we were down for the quarter that's two tenths of a point and so holiday was a drag that cuts and cause [ph] contribute positively, all the other product category that are so important contributed positively and we've now begin Q4 with a very strong, strong Elfa sale, start to the Elfa sale and we do expect that it's going to continue to increase, we're going to have a good Q4.
Steven Forbes: And then as a follow up may be on that topic with Elfa, right so may be regarding the Elfa sale bonus that is currently live, right you're going to your website and obviously the emails and so forth. Can you touch on I guess may be the thought process or the anticipated outcome of this sale? I don't know if you've done it before but there's obviously multiple scenarios where it could either be -- it could drive Elfa sales or incremental Elfa sales or you could drive sales within the non-closet categories, was there a particular thought process for the sales bonus or is the idea here really just to drive greater share of wallet, any color on that would be helpful?
Melissa Reiff: Well first of all I just want to make sure that you understand that the annual Elfa sale has exact same number of days this year as it did last year, it just had one shift from Q3 to Q4 that one day, and we did the Elfa bonus last year as well, and so we're repeating it and again we are trying to drive traffic, drive closets along with selling the complete solution in all the other product categories and we continue to see improvement in that.
Jodi Taylor: And Steve just to clarify one other thing, that bonus is specifically designed to drive an incremental purchase between the time of purchase in the short window in February through the end of the Elfa sale within February 28th, so it's absolutely to try to sell both more Elfa and more of our other product categories, it's designed to do both and it successfully did that last year.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Fassler, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Matt Fassler: First question when you're commenting on the web business I think you gave one 17% number and one 21% number and I think that the 21% was all in and the 17% might have been the pure play or maybe I [indiscernible], but if you could just give some clarity around what those two numbers were and what that implied for the I guess what would be the omnichannel or buy online, pickup at store piece of the business?
Melissa Reiff: Ecommerce sales we did show a large increase in Q3, with that 21% compared to 17.6% in Q2 and up 20.1% in Q1 so it has been a significant improvement in the trend, and all website generated with Click and Pickup delivered 17.7% in Q3 compared to 25.7% in Q2 and 26.7% in Q1, but we continue to see a strong online sales performance in Q3 in virtually all departments Matt including holiday did well online.
Matt Fassler: I guess the question it sounds like the first two quarters of the fiscal year your total ecommerce business was up more than the pure play ecommerce business i.e. your buy online, pickup at store is growing it looks like the buy online pickup at store business shrink a bit here in Q3 just curious what's that related to?
Jodi Taylor: Matt I'll hop in, it's Jodi, that was really driven by one thing specifically the last year [indiscernible] to the holidays we ran a Click and Pickup that we did not replicate this year, we wanted to make sure that we drove that more online and really didn't want to comprise service levels in the stores, it was a little bit of a challenge from operational perspective to run that offer and we chose not to this year.
Matt Fassler: And no real impact, that was not a gross margin driver this quarter, it was done purely with operational priorities in mind?
Jodi Taylor: Absolutely
Melissa Reiff: Yes
Matt Fassler: Second quick question in terms of gross margin drivers going forward and if you could comment on the tweak that you made in the timing of the cost cutting program, what that tweak relates to and what kind of legs you think the effort has as we think about gross margin trajectory, in your next fiscal year. I know you're not going to guide it but just in terms of the color on whether you are making that, obviously your gross margin, certainly [indiscernible] this quarter, so that will suggest some headway here.
Melissa Reiff: Absolutely, I think the tweak we made, let me take you through this separately. The tweak we for the expected benefits for this year where we did reduce by 1 million or $0.01 per share, so you saw that, that is completed due to the excepted flow through of the cost of goods project that we did on to the optimization plan, we still expect the same amount of savings, we're just seeing that flowing through a little bit lower than what we can anticipated which will cause that to shift out of fiscal '17 into fiscal '18, we don’t expect the amount to be lower. The 20 million is still very, very valid, it's just the timing how works, second as flow through now. And then specific to how we’re thinking about gross margin of first, we will be much more specific when we get to our outlook in May but in terms of sort of high-level headwinds and tailwinds that I would think about it, we absolutely see the ongoing benefits of this optimization plan cost to good project to give us a nice tailwind as we head into fiscal '18. As you will recall we didn’t start to see those benefits really flow through until the fiscal third quarter. That was a large reason why we had our overall margin of 50 basis points. And then in addition, we do expect that to continue to rise because it takes a bit of time for the purchases that are lower cost to become at that higher rate or that lower cost on an average basis since we use an average cost inventory system. So that will absolutely benefited, particularly into the first half of next year and then our pricing optimization project, which we’re not really clear yet, with the benefit of that, we will now, bring us but that is the last days in sort of our optimization plan and we anticipate that will completed in the first quarter of next fiscal year. And then I suggest comment as it well, I think one other quick thing to mention, just to keep in mind is, we're keeping a close eye obviously on the dollar and don’t have any firm commitments for our purchases of the inventory for next year, in terms of where that may cost us but that could be a potential tailwind or headwind excuse me again to the optimization plan benefit based on our visibility right now we still believe that the optimization plan benefits would be higher than what that headwind may be though.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Dan Binder: Just going back to the holiday related product and the performance there and you said now, a few years or weeks I mean initial takes, you think is it the content, is it the product, is it the promotion around it or the marketing of the product. What do you think is the key issue there?
Melissa Reiff: Dan we are not sure, that’s why we put together a team that is specifically focusing on it and we are going to be talking with customers, we're going to be looking at the assortment, we're going to be analyzing the data and we're going to make appropriate changes because we definitely want to play in holiday sales and our gift wrap wonderland is beautiful and it is very comprehensive but we're going to be looking at ways we can build on that business and the necessary changes that we need to make to get that going in the right direction.
Jodi Taylor: And Dan I think one thing to thing about for us versus stated some other retailers is playing so to speak in this space isn’t getting into businesses outside of our core categories we sell in, we already on -- an if you look at our departments and our stores we already do sell, the tower items that are often what we're presenting in our stocking separate area as well as the gift wrap items in our gift packaging department, so we do bring in items specifically for the holidays but as Melissa said we would make sure we are doing what we can to maximize that business, we don't plan to retreat from it.
Melissa Reiff: No build on it.
Dan Binder: And then Jodi could you give us a little bit finer detail on the gross margin impact from FX, and then from installations separately because you mentioned a higher cost for that as well as then what the likelihood, if you can give us that detail for Q3 and then what the likely projection is for Q4 on those line items?
Jodi Taylor: Absolutely, FX this quarter Dan to be real specific was a benefit of about 30 basis points, I am going to speak to just the Container Stores improvement that I think you were enquiring about which was the 110 basis points, additionally the offset for the service model for installation that was a negative 20 basis points, and then the balance was around just sort of optimizing the retail assortment which largely about 70 basis points of that came from our estimate of the optimization planned benefits from the cost of goods project.
Dan Binder: And then for fourth quarter best guesses on those items to more type of magnitude or…?
Jodi Taylor: I would expect that we should see a little acceleration in the optimization plan benefits from the cost of goods project as we continue to sell through our inventory and gain some of those benefits and then we would expect to still obtain some of the favorable foreign currency benefits I wouldn't expect that to be significantly different than what you saw in Q3.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt McClintock, Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Matt McClintock: I am sorry if I missed this but I dropped off for a second there, just two questions on pressures, cost pressures, number one transport cost, did you talk about that are you seeing any inflation there in terms of your transportation costs in your supply chain? And then number two wage inflation clearly you guys have a strong reputation for paying very strong wages to your employees but how do you think about wages going forward particularly as -- and I know I am not trying to get ahead of your discussion on tax reform but as you think about maybe spending that -- those proceeds?
Jodi Taylor: Matt I'll start and then Melissa you probably want to add here, but as far as the transportation headwinds that you're hearing called out we are fortunately been able to manage through those well and really haven't seen any notable cost pressures to call out so we did not call that out on this call. Obviously, we'll be watching it very closely and could become more of a headwind as we move into 2018. We are able fortunately to really leverage well our relationships with Leonard Green, they pulled together their consortium group from across their portfolio and we leveraged and negotiated as one large group and that does in fact I think give us a little more ability to negotiate through this than perhaps we can do -- that I know we could do on our own. So, that's definitely something we keep an eye on. On the wage side here you're absolutely right, we don't -- some of the announcements you're seeing other retailers come out and announced the new wages we already were at those levels for what we were starting to focus at anyway, so we are not up against some of those immediately. What it does of course do is put a little less gap between us and where some are announcing. But there is not an immediate short-term cost pressure that we’re facing there. But certainly, as you heard Melissa say investing in talent and employees is part of how we believe we will prioritize some of the tax reform savings.
Operator: Our next question is from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tami Zakaria: We have a couple of questions, the first one is. You mentioned in the past about customers procrastinating or waiting till the final days of the Elfa sales program. So, have you seen this time that trend changing and if so can you comment on whether you changed any marketing strategy to drive that?
Melissa Reiff: Yes, I can, hi Tami. First of all, yes, historically our customers have procrastinated, there is no doubt about it, but we have seen a very strong start to this Elfa sale, more order volume. And in terms of marketing, we have been working very hard I think as we talked about in past quarters, so always improve our selling process and some changes that we made in our store with some of our systems is really benefiting, we’re having a lot more follow up with our customers in our stores as well as on the phone and it is and I know it is driving more order volume. I still do anticipate, we still do anticipate procrastinators to come out, those last days of the Elfa sale are very, very huge. So, we have a lot of big volume days ahead of us.
Tami Zakaria: Great thank you that’s really helpful and my second question is can you help us understand the store redesign that you're doing and if you could remind us, some of the specifics around what areas in the store you're changing.
Melissa Reiff: You bet, we started construction in January just last month, so on this redesign of our Dallas flagship store and it should be completed and launched in June. And as I said the store will remain open during this week, but when we talk about the redesign we're looking at everything from new flooring, new fixing, new signage, new technology, new cash rap, this is what we call the container store of the future and we’re going test and learn and understand what works and what doesn’t and then we're going to volatile those learnings obviously at the appropriate time there is a proper capital allocation we want to apply that to existing stores to give them a redesign and update. So, this is really big deal for our company, everyone in our company is very excited about it and we just can wait to get it open in June and learn.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman we've reached the end of the question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Melissa Reiff for closing comments.
Melissa Reiff: Thanks, Omar. And I just want to say thanks to everyone for joining the call for your great questions and interest in our company. We appreciated and we will look forward to talking with you again in May and we will give you Q4 and the full year results at that time. Have a great rest of the day.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
