"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Citi Trends Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Friday, March 15, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Filandro, Managing Director, ICR. Please go ahead.
Tom Filandro: Thank you, Alicia. Our earnings release was sent out this morning at 6:45 AM Eastern Time. If you have not received the copy of the release, it is available on the company's website under the “Investor Relations” section at www.cititrends.com.
Bruce Smith: Thanks, Tom. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining us today. Also on the call is our Chief Financial Officer, Stuart Clifford; and our two merchandising Senior Vice Presidents, Christina Short and Brian Lattman. In the fourth quarter, comparable store sales increased 0.2% on top of a 5.6% increase in last year's fourth quarter. Continued strength in home and accessory businesses was almost completely offset by declines in the ladies business and to a much lesser extent children’s and men’s. The comparisons to 2017 were challenging for all three major apparel areas as each of them was up 6% to 7% in comparable store sales in last year’s fourth quarter. Ladies was impacted more so than the other areas as there continue to be fashion misses in the fourth quarter that we first started to see in the third quarter. We did a very good job of managing expenses during the fourth quarter, actually achieving 30 basis points of expense leverage on sales that were below our plan. From an earnings standpoint, diluted earnings per share increased 55% in this year’s fourth quarter, or 18% on an adjusted basis, driven by a much lower tax rate this year and fewer outstanding shares as a result of our stock repurchase program. Now, I will turn the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on the results before I discuss future expectations.
Stuart Clifford: Thanks, Bruce. Comparable store sales increased 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 1.6% for the full year. And looking at total sales, fiscal 2017 had 53-weeks, so fourth quarter and full year comparisons of total sales are impacted by having one fewer week this year. In the fourth quarter, total sales decreased 5.2% to $201 million with more than all of the decrease coming from the loss of the extra week sales of $14.8 million in 2017.
Bruce Smith: Thank you, Stuart. In other fourth quarter developments, we successfully opened seven new stores and relocated or expanded two stores, while closing two stores. For the full year, we opened 19 new stores, relocated or expanded eight stores, and closed six stores. Also, in connection with our expanded capital return program, we returned $45 million to our shareholders in 2018 in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Since the initiation of the program in 2015, we have returned $94 million to our shareholders. And looking forward, as we have entered 2019, sales were off to a slow start, decreasing 8% in comparable stores thus far during the quarter. Through mid-February, comp store sales were up 1% similar to third and fourth quarter trends, before significant volatility started to occur with a delay in IRS tax refunds relative to last year. As we went through the remainder of February, we had a nearly two week period where comp store sales declined every day ranging from approximately 20% to 60% before sales turned positive again in early March. Unfortunately the largest distribution of refunds by the IRS occurred at almost the same time that first of the month checks were received by some of our customers. It would appear that last year, our core customers made two shopping trips, one in February, when they received their tax refund, and one in early March when they received their first of the month check. This year, it appears that a portion of those customers made only one shopping trip, because we did not fully recover lost sales from the delay in tax refunds as we would have expected. In addition, total season-to-date IRS refunds, are lower than last year by more than 3%. In our guidance included in this morning's earnings release, we stated that we believe we will make up some of the loss in comparable store sales incurred thus far in the first quarter. However, we still expect to have a comp decline of approximately 3% for the fourth quarter. This assumption is expected to result in EPS ranging from $0.83 to $0.87 in the first quarter, compared with $0.83 in last year's first quarter. For the full year, we are projecting earnings per diluted share to be in a range of a $1.85 to $1.95 compared with $1.64 in 2018. This guidance is based on an expected increase in comparable store sales in a range of 1% to 2%.
Operator:  And the first question comes from Luke Hatton with B Riley FBR. Please proceed with your question.
Luke Hatton: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So you did a nice job managing expenses in 2018. Looking forward, does your annual guidance assume expense leverage or deleverage for 2019, and then can you sort of quantify any of that, or walk through that the puts and takes that are gone into that?
Bruce Smith: Yes, I'll give you a little bit of high level guidance. Generally, we need a comp store sales increase around 2% to 2.5% to break even on leverage although the past two years, we've actually beaten that, that historical norm. However, while we provide earnings and sales guidance, we don't break out the other lines, such as gross margin and expenses. However, there are some assumptions built into both areas regarding incremental improvement from the projects that we have going on that I mentioned earlier, such as the efforts to reduce freight cost, efforts to reduce certain SG&A line items, and the efficiencies in the distribution center from the enhancements to the packing system. So you should expect to see maybe a little bit of leverage in expenses within our guidance, but not a lot.
Luke Hatton: Got it. Thank you. And then, extending on the freight cost savings initiative, what exactly is that project and then sort of can you frame the potential annualized savings that you expect to get once that is completed?
Bruce Smith: Sure. Thanks Luke. It's a multipronged approach. It includes everything from rebidding our inbound contracts, and also likely expanding the base of our inbound suppliers while at the same time implementing a transportation management system that is designed to more efficiently allow us to select the lowest-cost routes each time.
Luke Hatton: Understood. Thank you. That's it for me. Good luck next quarter.
Bruce Smith: Thanks, Luke.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. So ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."
