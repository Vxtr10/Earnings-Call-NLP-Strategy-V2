Joel Anderson: Thank you, Farah, and thanks everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I will review the highlights of the quarter before handing it over to Ken to discuss our financials and our outlook and then we will open the call up for questions. We are pleased with our Q1 results. We delivered a sales increase of 22% to $153.7 million exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. With the upside coming from continued strong new store performance. This sales upside drove the EPS speed of a penny. Even as we absorbed the cost associated with the investments we have made in our business since last year, which Ken laid out to you in detail on our year end earnings call in March. We opened 19 new stores in Q1 representing store growth of 19% from Q1 last year and these openings included the new states of Alabama and Kentucky. As you can see from our results, the performance of our new stores continues to be very strong and with each set of openings, our excitement and our confidence and the store growth potential for this brand continues to grow. We offer and additive trend right merchandise assortment at exceptional value that caters to our core teen and pre-teen customer yet enjoys universal appeal. Our offering is delivered within a differentiated store experience that creates a destination for our customers. These continued to be distinguishing attributes of our concept that resonate with our customers in both new and existing markets. This is why our store growth opportunity is so attractive and store growth remains our number one priority. Already in Q2, we’ve entered the new market of Kansas City with three openings including our first store in the State of Kansas and we are thrilled to enter the very important new State of Florida with nine planned new store openings for the month of June. Our Q1 comp increase was 1.7% making this our 36th consecutive quarter of positive comps. This was inline with the upper-end of our expectations and compare us to a 6.2% comp increase in the first quarter of 2014. The weather impacted February and early March performance this year gave way to much improved March, April trends. And I do say March, April, because as you know, Easter shift limits the usefulness of discussion of any individual months. Teens did a great job improving several worlds during Q1 which were well received by our customers. Specifically, as we headed into Easter, the improvements we made with cross-merchandising and enhancing the visual appeal resonated with the customers. This continued with our post-Easter reset of spring. It is all part of the more holistic merchandising approach we are taking where we pull in products in different worlds to create a customer presentation that we believe is more cohesive and compelling. In addition, the merchant team has done a great job infusing the assortment with the right amount of newness and freshness like selfie sticks and shopkins just to name a few. Overall, from a merchandising standpoint in Q1, we saw strong performance at certain categories in our style, sports and candy worlds and we are well positioned for the summer selling season. Last quarter I talked to you in detail about our priorities for 2015. And the entire Five Below team is making good progress on each one. I just discussed our store growth which remains our number one priority. Florida will be our fourth new state so far this year, coming on the heels of Kansas in May and Kentucky and Alabama in Q1. We remain on track for our planned openings of 70 new stores in 2015. This will be a combination of six new states as well as densification in existing markets like Texas and the New York Metro areas. As we continue to realize the tremendous growth opportunity that still exists for Five Below. In fact, our planned opening in the Orlando market in Kissimmee Florida next week will be our 400th store. Opening in Orlando will expose our brand to new people from all over the country and a world for that matter. As we have consistently seen and as is implied by our outlook, the class of 2015 is expected to be another strong one for Five Below and our real estate teams are already hard at work on the planned 85 openings for 2016. On the merchandising side, those of you who have been in our stores have surely noticed the merchandising improvements that I spoke to earlier. You can expect to see our merchant team touch more the worlds as we move through the year and continue to make progress on this important strategic priority. I’d also like to give you more color on two of our key 2015 priorities. Number one, marketing and brand awareness. We continue to see a significant opportunity to increase consumer awareness of Five Below. Our most recent study which was completed since our last call with you confirmed the earlier brand awareness observations that I shared with you in January and on our Q4 call. As you know, we did a TV advertising test in Q4 last year, which we will expand during Q2 and again in Q4 this year. In fact, the Q2 ad launched on this past Monday in our test markets and you can view it on our website. There is also the opportunity to reduce our historical reliance on newspaper circulars and increase our digital mix. We made progress on this front in the first quarter testing multi-page digital ads via email and Facebook and we like what we are seeing. As an example, in Q1, we shifted one of our circulars to a purely digital ad fully supported on our social channels and sent to our email database. We expect to see more of this as we continue to work to optimize our media mix. We are also ramping up our digital content by producing engaging videos targeting on our core teen audience. For example, we created our first 60-second Easter video ad Sugar Rush that received strong viewership on YouTube. In addition, our daily Instagram content is receiving positive engagement levels. Lastly, as our store count increases, we are adding new customers to our email database and using email to tell compelling merchandising stories and drive traffic to our stores. I am proud of the progress the team is making in our digital transformation. Number two, systems and infrastructure. We continue to make good progress on our initiatives to build for our future. Our East Coast distribution center in Southern New Jersey is on track to be operational in July. In fact, we held the ribbon-cutting ceremony just this morning and have already begun receiving products. Our overseas consolidation initiative is starting up this month and we believe this will start to have a positive impact on our supply chain in the second half. I am also pleased with the progress we are making on all our systems initiatives including the implementation of a new merchandising planning system later this year which will help make us more efficient and nimble strengthening the inventory management and improving product flow. Now, to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail, I’ll hand it over to Ken. Ken?
Ken Bull: Thanks Joel and good afternoon everyone. I will begin by reviewing our first quarter results and then discuss our outlook for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2015. Our sales in the first quarter of 2015 were $153.7 million, up 22% from the $126 million reported in the first quarter of 2014 with the upside versus our guidance driven by continued strength in performance of our new and non-comping stores. We ended the quarter with 385 stores, an increase of 62 new stores or 19.2% from the 323 stores at the end of the first quarter of 2014. Comparable store sales increased by 1.7% compared to a 6.2% comp increase in the first quarter of last year. As we said last quarter, Q1 got off to a difficult start given the weather impact in the back half of February and early March. But solid performance for the combined months of March and April helped drive comp store to the high-end of our guidance range for Q1. Our Q1 comp increase was driven by average ticket as the adverse weather in late February and early March impacted traffic. In addition, last year in Q1, we had the residual impact of lower ticket rubber band sales related to the loom trend. So average ticket this year is more normalized in comparison. Gross profit increased 21.1% to $47.2 million from the $38.9 million reported in the first quarter of 2014. Gross margin decreased by approximately 20 basis points to 30.7%, inline with our expectations and driven primarily by higher freight expenses. When I refer to SG&A, operating income, net income and EPS for the first quarter of 2014, these are all references to adjusted amounts. There are no adjustments to the reported financial results for the first quarter of 2015. Please see the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation table in our press release for further detail on these adjustments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A for the first quarter of 2015 delveraged slightly to 26.1% from 26% in the first quarter of 2014. This deleverage was less than anticipated due to our better than expected total sales performance as well as favorability on certain expense line items including the more cost-efficient marketing mix that Joel spoke to which is funding our TV ad test in Q2 and later this year. Our operating income increased 14.7% to $7 million or 4.6% of sales as compared to $6.1 million or 4.9% of sales in Q1 last year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was 39% compared to 37.7% in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of changes in state tax rates. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2015 to be 37.5%. Net income increased 18.4% to $4.3 million or $0.08 per diluted share from $3.6 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. We ended the first quarter of fiscal 2015 with $52.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, availability of $20 million under our revolving credit facility and no debt. Inventory at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2015 was $119.8 million, as compared to $98.6 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Average per store inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 2% as compared to the end of the first quarter last year. Now, I’d like to turn to our guidance. For the second quarter ending August 1, 2015, net sales are expected to be between $182 million and $185 million, assuming a 4% to 5% comparable store sales increase and the opening of approximately 25 new stores. Earnings per share are expected to be $0.12 to $0.13. As discussed on our year-end call, in Q2, we will see the most significant operating margin decline of the year for the following reasons; first, our new DC becomes operational late in Q2 and we expect to see associated year-over-year deleverage of approximately 100 basis points given start-up and relocation costs including approximately 50 basis points of depreciation, which is included in SG&A. Second, we also expect deleverage of approximately 100 basis points resulting from compensation expense related to the leadership investments we have made since mid-2014, most of which falls in SG&A. And lastly, as we have said before, we will see a shift in marketing spend out of Q3 into Q2, resulting in deleverage of approximately 100 basis points related to the Q2 TV types that Joel discussed. These items will be partially offset by slight leverage and some other SG&A areas. For the full year 2015, we are increasing the guidance we provided back in March. Sales are expected to be in the range of $820 million to $828 million, with the comparable store sales increase of approximately 3%. This full year comp outlook continues to assume that our comparable store sales increase in both the third and the fourth quarters will be approximately 3%. This back half comp outlook takes into consideration the comparison against a healthy frozen license business in Q3 last year, which came on the heels of a strong 9% comp in Q3 of 2013. We now expect Q3 operating margins to be down slightly year-over-year as we have further refined our quarterly cadence estimates for depreciation related to our DC transition which resides in the SG&A line. This full year sales guidance compares to net sales of $680.2 million for fiscal 2014 representing a growth rate of 21% to 22%. In 2015, we plan to open 70 new stores and expect to end the year with a store count of 436 as compared to our 2014 ending store count of 366. For the full year, we continue to expect operating margins to be down slightly versus 2014, given the new distribution center and leadership investments that we have made since mid-2014. Both of these investments will be partially offset by leverage in other areas of gross margins and SG&A. For the full year, the incremental distribution center cost will show up primarily in SG&A due to an increase in depreciation on the larger facility, which represents approximately 30 basis points in SG&A drag or approximately $0.03 in EPS. We expect the full year effective tax rate of approximately 37.5% and GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $56.4 million to $58.2 million or an approximate 18% to 21% increase over 2014 with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.03 to $1.06. Net income is expected to increase by approximately 16% to 20% over fiscal 2014 adjusted net income. We are still planning CapEx at approximately $56 million for the year reflecting the opening of 70 new stores, investing in distribution centers, system upgrades and corporate infrastructure. Included in our fiscal 2015 CapEx forecast is approximately $20 million for the new East Coast distribution facility which we expect to be operational by the end of July. For more details related to our results and guidance please refer to our earnings press release. And with that I would like to turn the call back over to Joel to provide some closing comments before we open it up for questions. Joel?
Joel Anderson: Thanks, Ken. So in summary, we are pleased with our overall Q1 performance and the solid start to Q2. The entire team including our great store associates is focused in executing on all of the initiatives that support our strategic priorities and I want to thank them for their efforts. Let me reiterate. We are on track for a 70 new store openings and continue to see very strong performance out of our new stores. We are excited about our marketing mix changes that are designed to drive brand awareness and customer engagement. Our merchandising teams are hard at work invigorating the worlds and assortments with more newness and well to keep the stores looking fresh and the product presentation compelling. And as such, we continue to operate the business with a thoughtful, measured and disciplined approach. We are keenly focused on systems and infrastructure to ensure the foundation for this great business that’s capable of supporting significant growth that lies ahead for Five Below. With that, I’d like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Dan Binder with Jefferies.
Dan Binder: Hi good afternoon, it’s Dan Binder. My question is around some of the tests you are doing on TV. Is there anything more concrete in terms of the two fix of data that you can share with us on what you are finding and then just as a – maybe as a follow-up to that, as you think about Q4 and ways to engage with customer beyond these TV tests, any early thoughts on what you can do either from a promotion or store event type initiative?
Joel Anderson: Yes, thanks, Dan. Regarding the TV, it’s a little early to really give you any further statistics on the Q test. We shared on the last call the results from Q4 which we said, we are very pleased. It moved consumer awareness and it moved comp store sales. We expect that same results to happen here in Q2 and given that the TV test just started, I mean, literally less than 48 hours ago, we really don’t have any results yet on that. As for Q4, you can expect us to give you a little more clarity on that in our Q3 call. But, it’s safe to say as we’ve said; we are going to build a lot of our Q4 marketing around the TV tests based on what happens with our Q2 results, like I said started two days ago. And we’ll certainly share little bit more on that as we get later in the year.
Dan Binder: Great, thanks.
Joel Anderson: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.
Michael Lasser: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Really, two parts, maybe unrelated. I’d hopefully account for one. The first is on the guidance for the second quarter, 4% to 5%, you would imply at the top end a nice acceleration on a multi-year stack basis. So, maybe you can walk us through some of the puts and takes that you are thinking about for the second quarter, how much did you factor in the response to the television advertising plus, as I believe last year in the second quarter started out a little slow as trends cut off following Easter. So, maybe you can give us more detail on your confidence in the second quarter outlook. And then Joel, you also mentioned the updated brand awareness study that you had done earlier this year. Can you give us an exact percentage of where you think your current brand awareness is? Thank you so much.
Joel Anderson: Thanks, Michael. On the first part of your question, in terms of guidance, 4% to 5% range it’s on top of the three comp last year in the second quarter, so you are looking at a two year stack of about eight comp and so it’s right kind of in the range of that four comp per year for us. Certainly, we baked in some thoughts on the TV test as that based on the results from Q4. And we are off to a solid start as I said for May here as we go into June. In terms of brand awareness, I think what I meant by the latest results we got March, what we are continuing to see, Michael is that, our brand awareness whether we are in a market two years or six years, the delta is less than ten points in terms of brand awareness and for a brand our size and in markets where we’ve been for that long, we believe we should have much higher brand awareness levels. And hence the reason, the shift into TV and digital which is really where our core customers spend time. So it’s continued to see that. We looked at that before holiday. We looked at it after holiday. We look at it in the TV markets before we started and the TV markets after, and we saw significant increases. So, the numbers are about the same as they’ve been in the past. It’s just the – we need to move the needle in total. Ken, anything else to add on comps?
Ken Bull: No, Michael, again as Joel mentioned, as we always do look at our guidance, we see where we are up to this point and then we also consider what that ahead of us and I think, Joel mentioned, we did bake in some upside around the TV and as we probably know, we have been benefited by some good weather and we are pleased with the results so far in the beginning of the quarter and coming off of Q1.
Joel Anderson: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee CRT.
Charles Grom: Hi, good afternoon. I am just going to dovetail to the last question, when you look at your AUVs, where do you think they can ultimately go as you build the brand awareness, because clearly, since the IPO the rub on the company as at your – your new stores don’t have that traditional comp waterfall, but if your AUVs can continue to grow, then theoretically you do have a comp waterfall. So just curious where you think does the AUVs can go over time? Thanks.
Joel Anderson: Yes, I think the issue with TV is, more about rising tide raises all boats. And so, I think that if we can significantly change the trajectory on brand awareness, it will impact new stores as well as existing stores. So, I think it’s too early Chuck to have a sense of putting a projection on that. We are still in the early days of this test. We are going to roughly be in about the same percentage of stores in Q2 as we were in Q4. And, as I guided all of you on the last call, our goal is that we come out of holiday and have a full plan on where we are going to go with our digital strategy. But to get there successfully and to do with the discipline that Five Below always does, we’ve got to get through this test, and we’ve got to get through an expanded Q4 digital test. And then I think we’ll have a good sense on where we think AUVs will go.
Charles Grom: Thanks guys.
Joel Anderson: Yes, thank you, Chuck.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel: Thanks. So, two things. On the TV test, it looks like the incremental cost maybe a $1.5 million to $2 million, it seems us, is that about right? And then, how many markets, how often is that ad running? Is this broadcast or cable? And then, if cable, is it sort of cable geared to your co-audience Disney? And then secondly, more strategically, Joel, if you think about the worlds, I don’t know if you want to – if I can frame it one or two ways, but when you look at the ones that are maybe not reaching their potential when you see the most opportunity, one or two worlds are kind of have the most headroom, right, to where you think they can ultimately be?
Joel Anderson: Yes, thanks, John. There is a mouthful in there, John, so, let me try and get on and then you can come back at me if I missed it. I think you are about right on the TV test numbers, it’s right in that range. In terms of markets, it will be nine markets and in terms of the mix, it’s roughly about 75% TV, 25% digital somewhere in that range. And, it’s certainly weighted towards cable when I say TV. But it’s certainly a combination of cable and network, but about 25% of that will be digital meaning things like YouTube and that. In terms of worlds, John, what’s great about this business is that, it changes every quarter. I mean, the worlds bounce themselves out. We certainly shared with you that, crafts, games and style, we saw a lot of positive and I would say the, if you press me on it and I think we could have done better in crafts and room. But you know what that’s going to change next quarter. And the nine months I’ve been here John, I continue to see it change quarter-after-quarter and I think that’s what’s so unique about this business, is those worlds help keep us relevant as our teen changes from time-to-time. As for the TV test, it’s only going to be in 13%, 15% of our stores for this second quarter. Did I capture everything there, John?
John Heinbockel: Yes, thank you, very much.
Joel Anderson: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question.
Joel Anderson: Yes, you bet, Meredith.
Meredith Adler: I just would like to talk a little bit about the stores you are opening in new markets, are you seeing anything different in terms of the kinds of products people are buying, the patterns of when they buy? Anything that tells you, you need to be adjusting for different markets?
Joel Anderson: Yes, good question. But the answer, quite simply is, no. Florida is still in front of us. We certainly expect to see a different pattern down there more from a seasonality perspective, but not from a type of product that we carry. But, quite honestly, as we move from market-to-market, in similarities, I would say the one difference is, anytime we see a hot new trend emerge, it tends to hit the coast first and work its way inland. And, but other than that, there is nothing that’s said we need to be thinking about different assortments by markets.
Meredith Adler: And then maybe – I am sorry, I just wanted to follow-up, what you just said, do you have the capability if it seems obvious to not put that most hot trendy merchandise into the other markets as quickly and do you have a technology or the capability to do that?
Joel Anderson: Yes, we certainly, we have the ability already today to assort stores differently. We sort our classic stores as a example differently than our large stores. But teen sports is another great example in our Texas market. In Dallas, you are going to find the Cowboys and here in Philly you'll find the eagles. So, we've already built – have those capabilities built in.
Meredith Adler: Great, thank you very much.
Joel Anderson: Thanks, Meredith. Have a great day.
Meredith Adler: You too.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.
Christian Buss: Yes, you can talk a little bit about how much progress you made in terms of the reset of the assortment? How far through that process are you? And is it been rolled out across all stores?
Joel Anderson: Yes, first of all, Christian, I’d say, we’re probably never going to be done. I mean, this is a business that’s always evolving. Michael and his team have already made an impact, specifically in the now worlds example I talked about. But I think, as we get through the entire year, you will feel that impact touch each world and the reason it takes the year is, it trends on if it’s a domestically sourced world versus sourced overseas. So each world takes different amount of time before you’d have an impact, it might be seasonality, et cetera. So, certainly by the time we roll through the holidays, you will begin to see an impact on the assortment across all worlds. But when we do impact the world, we do, do it across the chain.
Christian Buss: That’s very helpful. Can I also ask about traffic and what you are seeing from the TV test that you are doing? Is it helping stimulate traffic in the markets that you are rolling it out?
Joel Anderson: Yes, absolutely and that’s why as we saw in Q4, healthy increase in comp store sales and that was certainly transaction-driven. I don’t have any commentary on the second quarter. Here it’s, literally it got into market Monday night.
Christian Buss: That’s very helpful. Thank you and best of luck.
Joel Anderson: Thanks, Christian.
Ken Bull: Thanks, Christian.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Paul Truesesel with Deutsche Bank.
Paul Truesesel: Hey, good afternoon guys. Ken, on the gross margin, I believe you attributed the declined in the first quarter, mainly to freight expenses. Could you just give us a little bit of detail around merchandise margins overall? What your – how you guys have been trending in terms of mark-ups, mark-downs, and just what are the factors that are going to impact that line item in 2Q and the second half?
Ken Bull: Sure. Thanks, Paul. As I said in the statements, the gross margin declined by about 20 basis points over the last year again driven by the freight expenses. A little bit more of a hangover from those – the additional container cost that we saw from the West Coast Port disruption that started back in Q3 of last year. But if you dig in deeper, from a merchandise margin perspective, again consistent with what we’ve seen historically, excluding the freight component of that, that those were relatively flat year-over-year and I think we’ve talked about this before that we would expect to see that going forward as we continue to invest in our scale in terms of our product as opposed to taking the cost there. So, merchandise margin is relatively consistent year-over-year.
Paul Truesesel: That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then, similarly, just on an expense, from an expense standpoint, like you said, there is a lot of timing that is impacting the second quarter. If you don’t mind, just give me a little bit of detail, specifically, as we move forward to the second half of the year on how you are going to be able to leverage, what’s the comp that you are going to need to leverage in the back half?
Ken Bull: Sure. I think, again, we have called out from an overall performance standpoint for Q3, and Q4. Q3, what we are looking at now is a slight decline in operating margins and again, that’s more of some clarity around the transitional cost around the distribution center, specifically in SG&A and depreciation, which we’ll see and that’s probably the key driver there. We’ve also said historically that we’ll start to see some of those leadership cost start to anniversary themselves in the back half of the year. And then also, the start-up DC cost that we are seeing in Q2, those should dissipate as it’s embedded in cost of goods sold. So, that’s just a little bit more color in terms of the back half of the year.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.
Matt Nemer: Afternoon everyone.
Joel Anderson: Good afternoon, Matt.
Matt Nemer: First question is on your comments, Joel, around new store performance driving some upside in the quarter. I am wondering if you can provide a little color on whether that’s coming from existing markets or new markets and if any changes have been made to the stores in terms of some of these recent states that you are going into or about to go into?
Joel Anderson: What was the second half? What the second half again?
Matt Nemer: Have you made any changes to the store in these newer states that you are going into?
Joel Anderson: Yes, I’ll take the second half first and then, Ken, maybe he’ll give some cadence on the upside on the new stores. Similarly, I was talking about with Meredith, we really haven’t made any material changes to the – what we are doing in new stores versus what we are doing in the rest of the chain. As I talked on the last call, we made changes to the now section. We’ve done that in both our new stores and we’ve done it in our existing stores. As for the new store performance, Ken, maybe you want to talk about kind of the cadence and to that upside?
Ken Bull: Sure. Yes, we were – as we noted, we were pleased with the performance of the new stores and Matt, that was actually coming out of both new markets. Right, so we had, we opened up Alabama and Kentucky, but also in existing markets also. And we were benefited slightly from the new stores from the timing of the new store openings. But again, performance was the key driver there and we saw that in both new and existing markets.
Matt Nemer: Okay, if I could just ask one follow-up too. If we look at frozen versus licensed opportunities that you see this year, how do you think that plays out on a full year basis. Can you match frozen with some of the movies that are coming out later this year? Thanks.
Joel Anderson: Yes, you know, Matt, you are asking for a crystal ball there to kind of predict what’s going to happen with the past. Frozen was a great license last year. But as you look at the history of Five Below, we’ve had several great licenses. So, it’s too early in the year to say what’s going to materialize for the back half on licenses. As you can recall, frozen was non-existent in Q1, 2014 and it turned out to have a large presence in the back half. So, overall, we are not materially worried about it one way or another and it’s just was a big license last year and others will surely materialize as we go through the year here.
Matt Nemer: Okay, Thanks and good luck.
Joel Anderson: Yes, thank you.
Ken Bull: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Patrick McEver with MKM Partners.
Patrick McEver: Thanks everyone. So on the inventories up 2% per store at the end of the quarter, pretty big decrease from where they’ve been running. I think they were up 20% per store I think end of the quarter and then up 7.5% at the end of last year. So, maybe you could just talk about that and how you manage to – I know the comp was a little bit, the sales were a little bit better than expected, but that wasn’t a huge variance there. So just wondering, how you are managing the inventories down, if that level up, let’s say about 20% relatively in line with footage growth is where you’d like to keep them? Or if there are opportunities perhaps to continue to work inventories down and boost inventory turns?
Joel Anderson: Let me give you a overall commentary and let Ken speak to the numbers exactly. But, this is just a great example Patrick of the investment we’ve made in people. Eric Specter joined us last year as our CAO, Michael Romanko and he is now our Head Merchant. And both those gentlemen have their teams focused on a discipline approach of running the business. And, just as we are investing in systems, we are investing in infrastructure, we are investing in people to run this business with a disciplined approach and growth for the future and those examples have made a difference. Ken, do you want to talk about?
Ken Bull: Sure. Just, Patrick, from a comparison standpoint, I think we’ve talked about in the past, we get affected by the timing of the imports and the penetration of the imports. And I think if you go back to Q3, that high average store increase was really driven by getting around that West Coast Port disruption where we wanted to get the product in earlier to position to us appropriately for holiday and for Q4. And I think you see us now getting into little bit more of a normalized period, I think we were in high single-digits in Q1 and now down to a 2% increase. So, we feel good about where we are right now. It’s a good level of inventory especially given where we see the summer business and where that needs to be. And again, we can in the future have some of those puts and takes if there is changes in import levels and taking ownership of that inventory and when it comes on the balance sheet for us.
Patrick McEver: Are you having any problems getting any specific products, I guess, I am thinking and you did call out shopkins as a strong item in the quarter. Some of my checks haven’t bee – it sounds that the inventory levels on those to be pretty spotty. So, and so it’s just a nice way infinite with that particular item or any other issues that might be stemming from perhaps in other areas of the store from the ports’ disruptions?
Joel Anderson: As we shared on the last couple calls, the West Coast Port disruption had a relatively extremely minor impact on Five Below and so any checks you maybe seeing with certainly be in isolated incidents, anytime you have a hot product that’s going to be – that’s in and out. But we are not having any supply chain issues that we control in terms of fulfilling our store inventory levels.
Patrick McEver: Great. Okay, thanks guys.
Joel Anderson: Thanks.
Ken Bull: Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Ruben: Hi, this is Andrew Ruben on for Vini. Thanks for taking the question. Is there any detail that you can provide on the entry into Florida? It looks like the initial stores are a little more spread out compared to some of the clustered openings in some cities? Is there any color in your approach to entering the state? And how you look at the opportunities for expanding in Florida longer-term?
Joel Anderson: Yes, Andrew, the nine stores next week in the month of June will be largely in the Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa metroplexes and the stores will add the balance of the year will be largely in those marketplaces as well. So, while not clustered on one day like prior ones, we are clustering largely in those three metros for the 2015 openings.
Andrew Ruben: Thank you.
Joel Anderson: You bet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Kelly Houser with Buckingham Research Group.
Kelly Houser: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just a question about your more mature markets like Pennsylvania and New Jersey for example. What inning are you in there with the store growth plans? And I think, as we look at those markets as benchmarks for the trajectory, at your newer markets going forward, have you seen any changes or differences in the performance of those stores from a traffic or a new store productivity perspective?
Joel Anderson: Yes, you know, certainly, our Philadelphia market is probably one of our most built-out markets. But we continue to see opportunities to open new stores there. We are going to open one as an example here in Center City Philly later this year and we still see opportunities emerge as we go forward. So you have to balance these existing markets with the need to continue to expand into the new markets. And you’ll roughly see us continue down that path over the next several years of expanding in this case, for 2015, six new states and we’ll backfill into markets as the real state opportunities present itself. I think all signs, Kelly, would still say, we haven’t seen anything that would limit our growth below the 2000 market that we’ve shared with you a number of times.
Kelly Houser: Okay, great. Thank you and then just secondly, you talked a lot about the merchandise changes that the new team has made and you talked about the cross leadership initiatives, could you just give us any specific examples of what we should be seeing in the stores? Is it better products? Is it sharper price points? If you could just elaborate on that please?
Joel Anderson: Yes, you know, I think it’s a combination of all of those. We are always going to be sharp on the price point. And the team is really focused on newness while value for our customers. Examples in the now area, is you might – you will see now in there apparel and tech items in the now area as well as the traditional items like inflatables, boogie boards, beach dolls. So it’s really bringing that holistic approach to everything somebody is going to need to have a great summer experience. And we’ll pull from what whatever world’s necessary they are kind of cross-merchandise and bring a more holistic approach together.
Operator: And this does conclude today’s Q&A session. I will turn the call back to Joel Anderson for closing remarks.
Joel Anderson: Thank you. Appreciate the time you’ve given us to share our Q1 results with you and we look forward to sharing Q2 with you in the months to come. Thank you. Have a great day.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you again for your participation and have a wonderful day."
