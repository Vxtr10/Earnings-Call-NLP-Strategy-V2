"Operator: Good day and welcome to the DICK'S Sporting Goods First Quarter Earnings Conference. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. 
Nate Gilch: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2021 results. On today's call will be Ed Stack, our Executive Chairman and Chief Merchandising Officer; Lauren Hobart, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Belitsky, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find the reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call. And finally, a few admin items. First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices. Our consolidated same-store sales calculation include stores that we chose to temporarily closed last year as a result of COVID-19. The method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19. Accordingly, our method of calculation may not be the same as other retailers. Next, as a reminder due to the uneven nature of 2020, we plan 2021 off the 2019 baseline. Accordingly, we will compare 2021 sales and earnings results against both 2019 and 2020. And lastly, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our second quarter 2021 earnings results before the market opens on August 25th, 2021 with our subsequent earnings call at 10:00 AM Eastern Time. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ed.
Edward Stack: Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. We are extremely pleased to announce yet another quarter of record results, as we continue to execute at a very high level and capitalize on incredibly strong consumer demand. We're in a great lane right now, and 2021 will be our boldest and most transformational year in the company's history. We believe the future of retail is experiential, powered by technology and a world-class omni-channel operating model.
Lauren Hobart: Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. As announced earlier this morning, we delivered another exceptionally strong quarter achieving record first quarter sales and our highest ever quarterly earnings, both significantly exceeding our expectations. Our Q1 consolidated same-store sales increased 115%, as we anniversary the majority of our temporary store closures from last year. The strength of our diverse category portfolio, supply chain, technology capabilities, and omni-channel execution helped us continue to capitalize on strong consumer demand across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness, and active lifestyle. We also saw resurgence in team sports business, as kids began to get back out on the field after a year in which many of these sports activities were delayed or canceled. Our strong comps were supported by sales growth of over 100% within each of our three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear, as well as increases in both average ticket and transactions. Like others, we also benefited from the recent stimulus checks. These results combined translate to a 52% sales increase when converts -- combined -- sorry -- when compared to the first quarter of 2019. From a channel standpoint, our brick-and-mortar stores generated significant triple digit comps and importantly delivered an approximate 40% sales increase when compared to 2019 with roughly the same square footage. Our eCommerce sales increased 14%, which was on top of our 110% online sales increase in the same period last year when the vast majority of our stores were closed for over six weeks. This represented nearly a 140% increase when compared to 2019. Within eCommerce, in-store pickup and curbside continued to be a meaningful piece of our omni-channel offering, increasing approximately 500% when compared to BOPIS sales during the first quarter of 2019. And as a percent of online sales, we saw sequential growth compared to the second half of last year. These same day services along with ship from store are fully enabled by our stores, which are the hub of our industry-leading omni-channel experience, both serving our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment.
Lee Belitsky: Thank you, Lauren and good morning everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results. Consolidated sales increased 119% to approximately $2.92 billion. Including the impact of last year's temporary store closures, consolidated same-store sales increased 115%. This increase was broad-based with each of our three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear comping up over a 100%. Transactions increased 90% and average ticket increased 25%. Compared to 2019 consolidated sales increased 52%. Our brick-and-mortar stores comped up nearly 190%, as we anniversary last year's temporary store closures and compared to 2019 increased approximately 40% with roughly the same square footage. Our eCommerce sales increased 14% over last year and increased 139% versus 2019.  As a percent of total net sales, our online business was 20%. As expected, this decrease from the 39% of net sales in 2020 given last year's temporary store closures, but increased compared to the 13% we had in 2019. Lastly, in terms of stimulus, while this can be difficult to quantify, we recognize that our athletes have more cash to spend during the quarter and believe we benefited from this during the first quarter. Gross profit in the first quarter was $1.09 billion or 37.3% of net sales and improved approximately 2,100 basis points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by leverage on fixed occupancy costs of approximately 1,000 basis points from the significant sales increase and merchandise margin rate expansion of 787 basis points, primarily driven by fewer promotions and a favorable sales mix. Additionally, last year included $28 million of inventory write-downs resulting from our temporary store closures, which were subsequently recovered in the second quarter of 2020 due to better than anticipated sales and margin on merchandising at the end of life upon the reopening of our stores. The balance of the improvement was driven by lower shipping expense as percent of net sales due to higher brick-and-mortar store sales penetration following last year's temporary store closures. Compared to 2019 gross profit as a percent of sales improved by 795 basis points driven by leveraged on fixed occupancy cost of 475 basis points due to the significant sales increase and merchandise margin rate expansion of 312 basis points, primarily driven by fewer promotions.  SG&A expenses were $608.3 million or 20.84% of net sales and leverage 940 basis points compared to last year due to the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $205.1 million of which $21 million is attributable to the expense recognition associated with changes in our deferred compensation plan investment values. This expense is fully offset other income and has no impact on net earnings. The remaining $183 million is primarily due to normalization of expenses following our temporary store closures last year to support the increase in sales, as well as higher incentive compensation expenses due to our strong first quarter results. SG&A expenses include $13 million of COVID-related safety costs, which in light of the latest CDC guidance. We expect these costs to the client significantly beginning in the second quarter. Compared to 2019, 2019's non-GAAP results, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales leverage 446 basis points from the -- due to the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $122.3 million due to increases in store payroll and operating expenses to support the increase in sales and hourly wage rate investments and COVID-related safety costs, as well as higher incentive compensation expenses. Driven by our store -- our strong sales and gross margin rate expansion, we delivered record quarterly non-GAAP EBT and EBT margin results. Non-GAAP EBT was $477.1 million or 16.35% of net sales, and it increased $684.8 million or approximately 3,200 basis points from the same period last year. More relevantly, compared to 2019 non-GAAP EBT increased $396 million or approximately 1,200 basis points as a percent of net sales. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79. This is compared to a net loss per share of $1.71 last year, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.62 in 2019, a 511% increase. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $3.41. This includes $7.3 million in non-cash interest expense, as well as 9.2 million additional shares that will be offset by our bond hedge at settlement, but required in the GAAP diluted share calculation, both related to the convertible notes we issued in the first quarter of 2020. For additional details on this you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables in our press release that we issued this morning. Now looking to our balance sheet. We're in a strong financial position ending Q1 at approximately $1.86 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.85 billion revolving credit facility. While at quarter-end inventory levels decreased 4% compared to the same period last year, our strong flow of product supported Q1 sales growth in excess of our expectations. Looking ahead, our inventory is very clean and we can continue to expect a robust product flow. In terms of supply chain expense, we are seeing elevated costs, which we expect to continue, but thus far have mitigated this pressure through higher ticket as a result of being less promotional and increasing prices in select categories. Turning to our first quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $57.2 million and we paid $33 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we also repurchased just over a million shares of our stock for $76.8 million at an average price of $74.59. And we have approximately $954 million remaining under our share purchase program. And our plan for 2021 continues to include a minimum of $200 million of shares repurchases. Let me move onto our fiscal 2021 outlook for sales and earnings. As a result of our significant Q1 results, we are raising our consolidated same-store sales guidance, and now expect full year comp sales to increase by 8% to 11% compared to our prior expectation of down 2% to up 2%. At the midpoint, our updated comp sales guidance represents a 22% sales increase versus 2019 compared to our prior expectation about 11%. While we have been very pleased with the start of our second quarter and are highly encouraged about the rest of the year, beginning in June, we will start to anniversary significant comp sales gains from last year. There's also continued uncertainty around when consumer behavior will normalize and what the new normal will be. And we are limited in our ability to forecast demand, particularly as it relates to the second half. Given this within our updated outlook, we have maintained our Q3 and Q4 performance expectations in line with that original guidance, which assumes comps will decline in the range of high single to low double-digits. Non-GAAP EBT is now expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion compared to our prior outlook of $550 million to $650 million, which at the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis is up 142% versus 2019 and up 45% versus 2020. At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10%. Within this gross margin is expected to increase versus 2019 driven by leveraged on -- leverage on fixed expenses and higher merchandise margins. When compared to 2020, gross margin is also expected to increase driven by leverage on fixed expenses, while merchandise margins are expected to be approximately flat. This assumes a gradual normalization promotions beginning in the second quarter and modest deleverage on fixed expenses in the second half. SG&A expense is expected to leverage versus both 2019 and 2020 due to significant projected increase in full year sales. As a reminder, at the beginning of 2021, we transitioned last year's premium pay program to a more lasting compensation program, including increasing and accelerating annual merit increases and higher wage minimums. The impact of these programs has been included within our guidance. In total, we are raising our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $8 to $8.70 compared to our prior outlook of $4.40 to $5.20. At the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis, our updated EPS guidance is up 126% versus 2019 and up 36% versus 2020. Our updated earnings guidance is based on 97 million average diluted shares outstanding, and the effective tax rate of approximately 24%. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our Q1 results, and we remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods. This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And operator, you may now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Robby Ohmes: Good morning Ed, Lee, Lauren. I'm sorry. I'm still too speechless to say congratulations.
Edward Stack: Thanks, Robby.
Robby Ohmes: I wanted to -- I think, I guess, Lauren, I'm going to ask you, on the curbside customers, can you remind us what the spend is on them? Is there like a calculation where as you're building more curbside customers, do they spend two X or three X normal customers? And do they spend that within the stores, and not in the stores? And maybe also with -- I guess it's 10.5 million new customers, you said they're younger and they're more female. Could you talk about how they're spending with you? And can you give us any kind of numbers? Do they spend more than historical customers? Are you losing some customers as you bring on all these new customers -- sort of more help on what -- who's actually coming into the store and how they're spending?
Lauren Hobart: Yeah. Thanks Robby. So, in terms of curbside customers, I mean, our best customer is our omni-channel customer, someone who shops in all channels. And the curbside is so new. We don't have specific data on those specific customers versus the general eCommerce customers. But overall, when somebody comes into our system and if they shop in the store and they shop online, they are more valuable customer. In terms of new customers, so, you're right. We had 8.5 million last year and 2 million new customers this year. Our database continues to grow. We have over 30 million emails that we can reach out to people with and communicate to and personalize our offers to them and our communication to them. And those athletes are spending more than the last year, and doing well versus existing customers. We're not going to share specifically how they're doing, but we are very pleased with their retention rates. They're shopping again. They're shopping again within a short window, a few week window and we're very pleased with that.
Robby Ohmes: Gotcha. And then just a quick follow-up. Lee, on the guidance, I just want to clarify what kind of promotional environment are you guys expecting kind of a return to full normal in the back half of this year? Or how should we think about the promotional environment?
Lee Belitsky: We're not anticipating a return to full normal, have we might've seen in 2018 and 2019, but we are anticipating the gradual return of promotions kind of beginning here later in Q2 and then building throughout the back half of the year.
Robby Ohmes: Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Congratulations.
Lauren Hobart: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Adrienne Yih: Good morning. Just as we thought it couldn't get better. It does. So, congrats.
Lauren Hobart: Thank you.
Adrienne Yih: Lauren, so my first question for you. For those, we've talked about this, for those who were strengthened during the pandemic, you're in a very unique position of being able to accelerate investment, has some new formats, take a little bit more risk than maybe some others. And so, we're seeing you do that with House of Sports. But you're also doing a variety of other things exclusive high touch in store soccer, Soccer Shops, and then also lower -- going lower with Overtime warehouse and off-price concepts. I know they're very small and still in test format, but what are you learning about each, particularly at the lower end Overtime Warehouse and the Going, Going On? Are you just testing those to see which format will win out? And then any ideas on kind of the thoughts there, the strategies? Thank you.
Lauren Hobart: Okay. Thanks Adrienne. So, in terms of -- you're right. We're investing in our business in many, many different ways. But the one thing I think is important to realize is that many of these initiatives were in place before the pandemic and are just continuing on now. So that would be, including our Golf Galaxy investments, our House of Sport, a lot of things -- our Soccer Shops, a lot of things were in the works and just basically pause during the pandemic. We come out of the pandemic now with a lot of consumer demand and tailwinds and the strategies that we knew made sense. Before the pandemic, we are even more eager and more excited to get going on them. So, we're definitely investing in the business. We're investing in our omni-channel experience. We're investing in experiential aspects of the stores you see with House of Sports and things like rock climbing walls and the soccer shops and footwear decks and HitTrax, it’s everywhere, where we can add experience. We're doing that. Specific to Warehouse and Going, Going On, that is truly just a test. We're using it as a clearance vehicle in the DICK'S channel. And we will have more to come on that, but it's just -- it's a handful of stores right now, and it is a test. It just in order to keep our clearance moving.
Adrienne Yih: Okay. Got it. 
Lauren Hobart: Yeah. Okay.
Adrienne Yih: Yeah. You bet. Lee, a quick one for you. What percent, if you -- if you're willing to share that with us, what percent of team sports and associate accessories sort of on an annualized basis. And I'm sure that that bumps up in the back-to-school season. So, if you can give us kind of penetration in the third quarter? And then lastly, $2 billion -- close to $2 billion in cash, what are your thoughts on what to do with all that money? Thanks so much.
Lee Belitsky: Well, a couple of things. The team sports has its highest penetration, the business typically in the first quarter. And then that's followed by the third quarter as the second highest penetration. And then the second and the fourth, fourth quarter as long as penetration. So, we did really well with team sports in the first quarter. And that's in its highest penetration corner. So, we're excited about it. We were well inventory coming into the quarter, expecting a resurgence and we were able to meet -- and we were able to meet that demand With respect to the cash that we have on the balance sheet right now, overall, we intend to continue to be conservative on maintaining cash balances. However, we're able to support the investments in new concepts that we have going forward. We're able to invest in working capital. We haven't rebuilt that inventory as yet, but we are continuing to be fairly aggressive on our inventory buys for the back half of the year. So, even though, in our guidance, we have anticipated sales down 10%, approximately 10% to last year, up 10% to 2019. We are going to be buying to support continued comp sales gains. As -- because we don't want to kind of lead the consumer there and we want to let the consumer -- let our customer tell us when they're ready to slow down. So, we're going to have the inventory and we have the working capital. And we have the cash to go to do that and make those bets. Ed had talked earlier and as had Lauren that we're going to continue to invest in our stores and new concepts. We are maintaining our guidance on buying back $200 million of -- at least $200 million in stock this year. And we expect to continue to make our dividend payments, as we increase those over the last several years. So, we have a lot of uses for it. But having said that, we anticipate continuing to be conservatively capitalized and maintaining sizable cash balance.
Adrienne Yih: Thank you. Great job.
Lee Belitsky: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Simeon Gutman: Hey, everyone. Nice results. My first question is on gross margin and I wanted to focus on two elements of it. First, if you can look at product margins and look at it within category, are there any changes that are improving that you could sort of attribute structurally getting better, whether the hardline margin is getting better within itself because of mix or apparel and footwear. And then, the other part of it is, if you look at the eCommerce business and I realize you look at it all combined multi-channel, but any way to quantify, how much better EBIT margins can be structurally from higher BOPIS or from ship from store than pre-COVID?
Lauren Hobart: So, I'll start with the last question. So, with eCommerce, it's certainly advantageous for us to have a higher penetration of BOPIS and curbside. We were up 500% versus 2019 on those areas. The channel is benefiting from that, but also benefiting by the fact that we invested in technology many years ago. And we've created a platform now what we do get leveraged as the sales come in. And then our gross margin -- getting to your second question, which has been extremely strong for the last few quarters and including this past quarter. Within categories, for gross margin, we are finding across the board. We are not in a promotional environment, nor are we certainly leading in any promotional way. And so, across the board, the categories have been improving in gross margin. It's true of hardlines. It's true of footwear. It's true of apparel. So, overall, it's a really, really good story and we're very, very pleased with eCommerce profitability. The more BOPIS and curbside better, but even the ship from home business, everything is more profitable now as we scale.
Lee Belitsky: Yeah. And I would just add to that too. The strength of demand, it’s kind of across our product assortment. We're not really creating much in the way of clearance merchandise. So, we don't have a little bit of an anchor on our merchandise margin rates coming from dealing with clearance that we would typically have. And the clearance stores that we've opened have also helped us to more efficiently deal with our clearance inventory. So, structurally that's helped us with our merchandise margin rates, but the strong demand has helped us as well.
Simeon Gutman: Okay. And then my follow-up maybe for Ed and for Lauren. I know you're trying to be prudent about what we extrapolate for the future given how strong things are right now. Maybe can we talk about certain things that you think may continue, whether it's the category stay stronger and then things that you've changed, whether it's product assortment or your platform? And I don't know if you throw around at this stage sort of comping the comp again, right? But this business is, I think, did double-digit last year, now it should -- looks like it's on track to do double-digit again. Is that even a scenario that you've been joking around with? I know it's early, but curious how you think about what's sustainable here.
Lauren Hobart: Yes. So, there -- look, we're learning every day as is everybody in terms of what the new consumer's going to be and what the new consumer behavior is going to be. There's a lot of factors going on right now, including as Lee said, stimulus and a whole bunch of other things, but there are -- but what we've seen for sure is that team sports came back with a vengeance at rightly so, has it had been a year or so since people had played or more, and at the same time, some of the quote unquote surging categories, that were quote unquote pandemic related, such as golf and fitness, outdoor are still really, really, really strong. So, can we predict the future? We can't? We were sort of joking that you guys were going to ask about if we can comp the comp, but we feel really, really positive about the business and what we're seeing about consumer demand as we head into the future.
Simeon Gutman: Okay. Fair enough.
Edward Stack: I think a couple of things that have changed -- I think a couple of things that have changed that we've done -- has been -- our team has done a great job with differentiating products that we have in the store versus our direct competitors, or even some tangental competitors by differentiating product, not only from the key brands that we have. If you take a look at our footwear assortment and what we've done with the premium full-service footwear areas, or what we've done with our concept shops from Nike and a few other brands. And along with what we've done with our vertical brands, the team has so differentiated the product out there that we're really a different retailer than our competitors. And I think that's -- that the consumer is realizing that, shopping us more and gives us the opportunity from a margin rate standpoint to not be in that promotional environment. And I think we'll be less promotional. When and if a promotional environment comes back, I think we'll be in less of a promotional aspect of -- from our company because of the differentiated product. And I can't say enough about how this merchandising team, the store team, the marketing team has developed this and one of the real reasons for our success right now.
Simeon Gutman: Yeah. That's helpful. Thank you both.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Please go ahead.
Paul Lejuez: Hey, thanks guys. Here, if you could give -- curious if you could give some of the com metrics traffic, ticket versus 2019, particularly at the store level. We'd also be curious to hear about categories versus 1Q 2019, just which ones have really taken a large amount of share within the box and online versus those that are down. Obviously, hunt would be, I think, the obvious one there, but curious if any others are lower? And then just second, on the team sports strength that you saw in the spring, how much of that was driven by spring team sports versus fall sports that just got pushed out to the spring? Thanks.
Lauren Hobart: Yeah. So, our traffic and ticket versus 2019 are both positive and we're feeling really good about that. Obviously, when you look versus 2020 that the traffic numbers are a little distorted due to the fact that -- I think we're up significantly, our stores were closed, but even during -- versus 2019 where we have a strong double-digit growth in both of those. With regard to team sports, it's an interesting thing what's happened with team sports. There's certainly a lot of pent-up demand. And then there's also strange phenomenons. Like there was a mini football season this January/February that you wouldn't have thought would have happened. And so, it's definitely -- there's been excessive amounts of team sport demand in Q1. But I don't think that that's -- I mean, I'm guessing, but I don't think it's a pull forward of ball sports. I think there's still tremendous number of athletes who are going to take the field who are not equipped yet. And football come back in mass and kids are still growing. So, we feel good about the future of team sports.
Paul Lejuez: Got it. Thanks. And just on the supply chain side, any categories that you're still finding it hard to chase.
Lauren Hobart: So, I think this is an important point, but our supply chain group is -- has done an absolutely outstanding job managing through 15 months of real challenges from a supply chain standpoint. And that's been -- originally it was in the hard goods and fitness, and we talked about that, but we -- it's hit almost every aspect of the business. So it's -- we're chasing all the time. We're chasing everything, but we've gotten really good at it. And we have tech teams on it day-in and day-out. We're working with our vendors. We're picking up product wherever it is, and helping get it into our supply chain sooner. And so, I think this has actually become a core capability of ours that we can drive growth with a challenged and challenging supply chain.
Paul Lejuez: Got it. Thank you. Good luck.
Lauren Hobart: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. So, you're pointing to a 10% operating margin this year. Your prior peak has been a 9% operating margin. Is it 10% margin the right way that we should be modeling the business moving forward?
Lee Belitsky: Michael, we're going to have to see how the back half of the year settles out this year. I think there's still quite a few unknowns about what the new level of demand is that's out there within our product categories. We know it's going to be where we are. We're very confident it's going to be significantly higher than 2019. And we -- and we've become meaningfully more optimistic about that as we get longer and longer into this run we're making right now. But we certainly feel better about higher levels of operating margin than we did three months ago, six months ago, but I don't think we're ready to guide on what the long-term margin outlook is yet until we see kind of a normalization of spending on travel, on restaurants and how that affects our categories. But certainly the consumer is saying they want to continue to be outside, trying to -- continue to try to get fit, buying athletic appeal, athletic footwear, playing golf. And I think a lot of those trends are going to stay with us for some time, but we've got to let this play out a little bit before we can get the long-term view.
Michael Lasser: And Lee, as part of that, can you frame when you had a 9% operating margin back in 2012, you had a 31.5% gross margins, eCommerce penetration was much lower than. How does your merch margin today compared to where it was back then? And as an unrelated point to that, you had mentioned that you were very pleased with the start of the quarter. What does that click the bias to the upside to for your full year guidance? It's the strength you're seeing now continues. Thank you.
Lee Belitsky: The merchandise margin rates are running higher now than they were at peak, because -- simply because we just don't have any promotions right now. And we have very little clearance merchandise to work with, and we've never really been in a position where we haven't had to run promotions. Now that's going to be -- as we go forward, it's going to be a matter of when do promotions return to what level or encouraged by some of the activities that some of our brands has been narrowing distribution of product, and it's been narrowing it basically away from some of the players that have typically led promotions in the past. So we're excited about that and what the outlook could be around promotions there. We're encouraged by the -- we're encouraged by the restraint there's been on putting product into the various channels as well. So product continues to be -- product levels continue to be pretty thin, which suggests that continuing favorable margins. So, merch margin as we look out should continue to be favorable, but right now we're running meaningfully higher than we were at peak. The start of the quarter, how does it impact fiscal year guidance? We baked some of the beat from Q2 into the guidance. The guidance roles in our first quarter beat versus what our expectations were in a little bit from Q2. At the low end, it's got a small beat from Q2; at the higher end, it's got a little bit of a bigger beat from Q2, but we are flowing through some increases from the second quarter as well.
Michael Lasser: That’s very helpful. Good luck with the rest of the spring. Thank you.
Lee Belitsky: Thanks, Michael.
Lauren Hobart: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Michael Baker: Okay. Thanks. A couple of follow-ups here. Just -- we know the first quarter -- you said the third and fourth quarter down about 10%. You can get a pretty big range for the second quarter anywhere from -- loosen my math, down high single digits to up low single digits. Can you sort of -- why not just tell us what you think the second quarter will be since you already -- what the guidance is the second quarter, since you already gave us the back half? Just to make sure everyone's on the same page.
Lee Belitsky: We're not going to get the specific numbers around the second quarter. However, we're very pleased with the start. And really in June, we started to come up against these significant double-digit comp sales gains and coming to Father's Day and the beginning of back-to-school. So, we're going to have to let it play out here as we start to come up against the big gains that we saw in kind of the back half here of the second quarter.
Michael Baker: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. I also wanted out to follow-up on Mike Lasser's question just about where you are now versus your prior peak. It seems to be that your vendor relationships have improved quite a bit. Just on my math, you're a -- Nike is actually a smaller percent of your business and it was -- you're in bigger percent of Nike's North American business, if you will. I think Under Armour is coming back on some of the vendor. Can you just get a bigger picture? Maybe this is the question for Ed. Just describe, how and why your vendor relationships have changed over the past eight years or nine years since the past peak.
Edward Stack: I think our vendor relationships are better than they were back then, but they weren't bad back then either. And I think that some of the key people that we partner with have seen the commitment we've gotten to from a service standpoint, a commitment we've gotten to the environment and the experience when an athlete comes into our store. And they've liked that. We've worked with them -- with that. They've given us additional allocation of product, which we've -- we've done a great job. Our teams have done a great job of merchandising, marketing, selling. And I think it's -- we really look at the key partners that I've mentioned truly as partners, and I think partnership can be an overused word, but we really do partner with them. They partner with us. We understand what their objectives are. They understand what our objectives are. We sit down and we have a conversation, we come to marketplace. That's good for both of us. And I think that we'll continue to move forward. And our relationships with the brands I think will only continue to get better. And I think that's good for us, and I think it's good for our brands too.
Michael Baker: Okay. Yeah. Makes sense. I'll just end by saying I'm not looking forward to buying my second pair of football cleats for my son in five months, but I guess, that’s for me …
Lauren Hobart: His feet are growing.
Edward Stack: Well, I hope that everybody feels the same way you do.
Michael Baker: Thanks.
Lauren Hobart: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Please go ahead.
John Kernan: Yeah. Let me extend my congratulations on just phenomenal performance and just such a differentiated offering versus all your competitors out there.
Edward Stack: Thank you.
John Kernan: Lee, could you give us any detail on how you're thinking about transactions and tickets for the remainder of the year? I feel like there's still tailwinds behind tickets. Obviously, transactions was going to be huge in Q1, but I'm curious in terms of how we should think about transactions ticket in the overall comp guidance from the remainder of the year?
Lee Belitsky: Well, I think generally, they're more tailwinds behind the ticket side and the transaction to what will remain to be played out here. But as we continue to be not very promotional and not getting back to normal kind of levels of promotion really this year, that bodes well for ticket. Also we've seen trading up in some areas as well. Particularly like in golf, where there's a better inventory, supply of new products. And there is in cascaded prior year products, the consumers showed willingness to trade up and we expect that trend to continue. So, I think that there's pretty good tailwinds around ticket, around promotions, lack of clearance, trading up a bit to some better products. So feel good about that. Transactions, we're going to have to let that play out and see when as folks get back to kind of normalized activities, travel and so on, but we continue to get the trips, the high level of trips that we're getting now into our stores and our comp sales and stores have been fantastic. And we'll continue to get the traffic online as well. I'll tell you the outlook for ticket is good. The outlook for traffic maybe good, but we're not that certain around that.
John Kernan: Understood. Maybe just a quick follow-up on private label. Their performance in Q1, I think it was annualizing around 1.03 billion last year. Just the margin profile of that business, the top line performance in Q1, and then any initial reads on Burst?
Lauren Hobart: Yeah. The vertical brands performed fantastically in Q1, in line with the entire chain and margins did expand somewhat so really great trends on vertical brands. And did you say about Burst? Was that your thought -- was that your last question?
John Kernan: Yeah.
Lauren Hobart: Yeah.
John Kernan: Yes. 
Lauren Hobart: Yes. We're very pleased with Burst and how it's launched. And the fact that it is a true white space in our stores. It's not a -- it's not -- it's an opportunity to get the athletic male in a lifestyle capacity in a way that we weren't serving before. So, I would say everybody on the call should go try it. It's amazing. It's really high quality, fashion forward product, and we're excited about it. 
John Kernan: Excellent. Thank you.
Lauren Hobart: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Warren Cheng with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Warren Cheng: Hi. Good morning. Great quarter. I just want to follow-up on Adrienne's question about some of the new banners that you're piloting. Can we see square footage -- the square footage component of rather than start to tick up in the near term? And also, can you just talk a little bit about how the Overtime and Going, Going Gone! concepts are tying into the inventory clearance? What products go through these channels? So they moving the needle on gross margin. Thank you.
Lauren Hobart: So, first question, on the square footage, we do have some net growth in stores coming in the next few years. In the long-term, our strategy is not to significantly expand our square footage, but possibly that we will show up differently within the square footage we have. But we are building new concepts that will be some net square footage growth. Lee, I'll turn to you for the Going, Going Gone! and clearance question.
Lee Belitsky: I mean Going, Going Gone! and clearance, we have a couple of different concepts within here. But at this point they're handling clearance product coming from DICK'S stores. The DICK'S stores have been generating less clearance, but we certainly have enough to give us a good test in these stores. It is moving to gross margin needle, the gross margins -- the merchandise margins that we're getting out of these stores are considerably higher than when we handle clearance merchandise within the DICK'S stores. So, we're really pleased with that. And it's still a test for us. We're going to read it for -- we're going to read it for a while and make a determination, but so far the signs are good that at a minimum it's helping us with clearance in the DICK'S stores, and maybe there's an opportunity to make some money at it long-term. But we're going to test it and see how it works for us.
Warren Cheng: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Lee Belitsky: Good morning.
Christopher Horvers: So following on the sort of use of cash opportunity that you have had. Are there -- as you continue to focus on experiences and getting better at eCommerce, are there certain capabilities that you think would be useful in terms of using some of that cash deployment and in acquiring that and bringing that those capabilities in house?
Lauren Hobart: So, we always are looking to improve our core capability. Then a lot of our investments and capital this year is exactly that improving our capabilities. We look opportunistically at M&A as well, if that's what you're getting at, but right now we're very focused on building capabilities internally.
Edward Stack: And I'll just say that we've got a really, really good relationship at this point with Federal Express and meet with them regularly as I talk about different ways to get product to our athletes more quickly. So, while we do look at opportunities to bring capabilities in-house, we're really pleased with the partnership we've got with this -- with the team at FedEx. And they've been extremely helpful and coming up with new ideas as well.
Christopher Horvers: Got it. That's very helpful. And then looking at the merchandise margin improvement in 1Q relative to 4Q, it did tick down a little bit, obviously relative to 2019 that is. Obviously, very strong numbers on a two-year basis. So, was that just -- we have more winter clearance, more clearance activity in the fourth quarter around winter and that's the delta on a two-year basis versus not -- 1Q's not a big as big of a clearance quarter.
Lauren Hobart: Lee, do you want to take that?
Lee Belitsky: It does come down to mix. And there was more clearance in the fourth quarter of 2019 than -- and first quarter is not a big clearance quarter for us. So, yeah, you're on it. You're on it, Chris. 
Christopher Horvers: Got it. Thanks very much. Have a great spring.
Lauren Hobart: Thank you.
Lee Belitsky: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.
Joe Feldman: Yeah. Thanks guys. And again, congratulations on the quarter. So, one of my questions, with regard to back-to-school in that period, are you guys changing your approach this year? I mean, presumably, it's coming at a time of the child tax credits coming through and that should help families. And I would think you guys should be able to capitalize on that. So, I was wondering if you're thinking about it differently than you have in years passed.
Lauren Hobart: Back-to-school, we think is going to be big. A lot of opportunity to meet needs both on the field and in the classroom for athletic apparel and footwear. So, we're leaning into it. We have a great marketing campaign plan. We've got great products coming in, and we're expecting it to be a strong season.
Lee Belitsky: And recall it, last year back-to-school, I'd say, was smaller than typical because lot of kids didn't go back-to-school and it came later because many of this -- many schools were delayed for several weeks before they got going. So, there's a big opportunity between the child tax credit that's coming, and the smaller and delayed back-to-school to get the third quarter off to a good start.
Joe Feldman: That's great. Thanks. And if I could follow-up one more on. With regard to labor, we keep hearing so much about -- it's been difficult to find labor out there and also we know of wage pressure, and I know you guys talked about that. But can you maybe share some thoughts on how you're -- if you're able to get labor as easily as you have in the past and what kind of wage pressure you are thinking about for this year?
Lauren Hobart: Yeah. So, I think it's a good question and it's something obviously we and everybody else has focused on. We've gotten ahead of it in a number of different ways. In that we are -- we were out trying to build to peak volumes and hire people in advance. But I do think one thing that's really important to note is that the -- our teammates -- between our policies and how we've shared some of the upside in our earnings over the last year and also how we treated people during the pandemic and tried to bring them back as quickly as possible and kept people's health insurance paid, we really put our team first. Personally, I could say the company felt like a family in every single way during that time. And it was really a joy to see. And I actually do think that that's helping us from a retention standpoint. I think, in general, we are an employer of choice right now. And so, we certainly are struggling, a few markets we're struggling, but it's not a top of mind challenge.
Joe Feldman: That's helpful. Thanks. And good luck with this quarter.
Lauren Hobart: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Scot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Thanks for sitting me here. So, you guys are obviously making a lot of changes to the business. You talked about the golf, the soccer shops and new store formats. And you've also talked about how you're happy with the early results. But honestly, it seems like everything's really strong right now. So, do you think you're in a position where you can really evaluate these initiatives properly and whether they're going to generate the kind of returns you guys are looking for in a more normal environment?
Lauren Hobart: Yeah. It's a great question. I mean, obviously, you're right. Every category is trending right now, or most of them are, so obviously things are doing much better than we might've expected. But when we built these initiatives out, we didn't expect comps quite like this or sales quite like this. We have a productive business model and we're learning from these concepts every day in terms of what can be translated back into the DICK'S store, both in golf and with the House of Sports and all of these experiential concepts. So, I think we can tell, and we look versus balance of chain, how things are doing. We can tell what's working, what's not.
Edward Stack: And these are not concepts or programs that we put in place recently or thought about recently. As I said, these have been a couple of years in the gestation period. And we're pretty confident that these are going to work. Whether it's the soccer shop -- we had done a couple of soccer shops last year into -- right in the middle of the pandemic and knew that soccer was an area that we weren't graded. If you take a look at how we are in baseball and football, soccer was an area that we trailed in. So, we're just making some of these investments in these areas to bring us up to parody with some other categories that we are more top of mind with. So, these have all been very thoughtful. And I suspect there might be a surprise or two here, but we're pretty confident with these. And the House of Sport that we opened up in Rochester is off to a great start. The other House of Sport that we've done in Knoxville is a very differentiated experience. And I think they were going to continue to be very viable as we go forward.
Scot Ciccarelli: That's all really helpful. And then kind of related to that, I'm assuming a lot of these changes does increase your cost of doing business or that the comp breakeven level. So, is that something we should kind of think about when we think -- if we assume that we'll go back to a more historical comp pattern at some point?
Edward Stack: We think that these areas have a big growth opportunity, even when we go back to something that would be normal, whatever the new normal might be. But these are categories that we felt that we were deficient in or had a great opportunity in prior to the pandemic. In the pandemic put them on hold, and we've had the opportunity to continue to refine and test them during this period. So, whether it's access to product -- and when you take a look at the soccer shops that we've done, we have access to shoes at price points that we didn't have access to before, or decided not to put in. And when we've tested these, that athlete, who's the more enthusiast athlete has really responded no differently than what we did with baseball prior to the pandemic when we reengineered our baseball department and really tried to cater to that enthusiast baseball player, which did great. We've got the same thing is going to happen -- is happening in soccer. And we've got a couple of other opportunities that we'll be looking at later this year and into next year that we think we can do the same thing with it.
Scot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.
Chuck Grom: Hey. Good morning. Just small quick one for me. When you look at sales performance in the quarter and maybe into the month of May by region, particularly in states that are farther along in the reopening process, I'm curious what you're seeing from a trip frequency and overall buying perspective.
Lee Belitsky: I mean, we are seeing strength across the country right now, probably seeing a little bit more strength in the states that were closed for longer, like in the Northeast and California, but nationwide we're seeing strength.
Chuck Grom: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Steven Forbes: Good morning and extending my congrats as well. Maybe just to follow-up on loyalty and customer trends, right? If I look for the presentation here, you can note that 70% or the 8.5 million new athletes were acquired during the -- through the digital channel in 2020. So, curious if you can sort of discuss how that cohort is engaging with the brand in 2021 thus far in terms of channel? And whether the repeat or retention behavior has historically differed between those acquired through digital versus brick-and-mortar?
Lauren Hobart: Yeah. So, that's a great question. What we're finding is that generally speaking, people's first transaction once acquired is in the same channel that they came in through. And we get so many new users in the digital channel that I don't think looking backwards to say, how that's going to change. It's going to be very helpful. So, retention is good. It's good across all of -- whichever way they're coming in. And they're repeating more often than not in the channel where they came in.
Steven Forbes: Thank you. And then, just a quick follow-up. I'm not sure if the number was disclosed before, right, but you call out the -- in the presentation, I think it's the 4 million ScoreCard Gold, right? I'm sorry -- 5 million ScoreCard Gold loyalty members, $500 or more. So, two questions on that. One, what was that up versus 2019 or any sort of commentary on growth right in that -- in the Gold member base. And then also any comment on just the breadth of category participation, right, among that group, right? How broad is their purchasing behavior in terms of the categories in which you serve?
Lauren Hobart: Yeah. The ScoreCard Gold's program actually is one of the reasons why I think you're noticing at the first time, it isn't -- it's only a year or two old that why -- we don't have a conference in 2019. We started, I want to say, 18 months ago or so that we started the program. And it's obviously our best customers. You have to spend $500 to get into the program or be a credit card member, and they definitely only buy abroad range of products, so they are the best of the best.
Steven Forbes: Thank you. Best of luck.
Steven Forbes: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Seth Basham: Thanks a lot. And I'll add my congratulations. My questions around fiscal stimulus. I know it's tough to quantify, but do you have a sense how much this stimulus might have driven your sales growth versus the 2019 in the first quarter?
Edward Stack: Yeah. We certainly believe that it helped the business, but I wouldn't want to put a number on it. The business was in good shape going into the stimulus. We did get a nice lift when those checks started hitting, but the business has continued to be strong throughout the first quarter and going into the second quarter as well. So… 
Seth Basham:  We look at the slowdown implied in your guidance for the second quarter, from the first quarter in terms of growth versus 2019, would you say that the biggest driver of that slowdown is fading fiscal stimulus benefits?
Edward Stack: I wouldn't say that.
Seth Basham: What would it be then if you could give us some recap?
Edward Stack: So, I would say, first, versus 2019, I think our biggest concern is when people start traveling over the summer and they're booking vacations and spending in restaurants and going to concerts and things like that, where's the share is going to be. And I think that's more of a concern than the stimulus, because there is actually some new stimulus coming beginning in July with the child tax credits that are going to start to be distributed on a monthly basis.
Nate Gilch: Seth, do you have another question or do we want to go on to the next question? Next question, sir.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Brian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. I do want to add my congratulations on a great start to the year. And we're getting towards the end. I'm going to ask one -- just one question. It's a bit of a follow-up. But we've talked about you -- you've mentioned the forthcoming more difficult comparisons, there's telegraph in your guidance, you're smart, we're assuming the moderation sales trends through the back out for this year. So, the question I have is, are you -- as you face about this, are you prepared to sort of say just let the business run against these comparisons as well. Are there levers at your disposal that you could potentially pull to help cushion new pack of these comparisons?
Lauren Hobart: Got it. Yeah. Sorry. I got it. So, yeah, there was a multiple levers we could pull, if we wanted to. And we'll have to assess it. I mean, as we've mentioned, we're not promotional right now. Could we pull that lever? Yes. Do we want to know? No. So, we're going to watch it. We're really monitoring the business versus 2019 trends and trying not to get caught up in the ups and downs of each of these quarters or do anything irrational as a result of what might be uncomfortable for a short term. So, yes. We have levers, but we are planning to continue with the business as it is.
Brian Nagel: Great. Then maybe just one quick follow-up, from a bigger picture standpoint. And clearly, the business perform extraordinarily well here as the economies reopening. Are you seeing indications that through the COVID crisis, there was some competitive fallout within the sporting goods category? You're potentially making it an easier competitive backdrop for DICK'S now.
Lauren Hobart: Yeah. I mean, there's been obviously some other channels, non-sporting goods. Some competitors have gone out of business and some of the department stores have stopped selling some product. But generally speaking, now we are the leader in the sporting goods category and remain that way.
Brian Nagel: I appreciate. Congrats again. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lauren Hobart, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.
Lauren Hobart: Okay. Thanks everybody for joining our Q1 call, and we will see you next quarter. Have a great spring.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
