Bob Sasser: Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning we announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. With the closing of the Family Dollar transaction on July the 6th, this is our first sales and earnings report for the combined company. This report include one month of Family Dollar sales and operations combined with a full quarter of Dollar Tree performance. All Family Dollar stores are reported as new stores. In the Dollar Tree segment of our business same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7%. This is on top of a 4.5% increase than second quarter of last year. Sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket with traffic increasing the most. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations the same-store sales increase was 2.4%. Total sales at Dollar Tree stores for the second quarter grew 8.3% to $2.2 billion; this was at the mid point of our previously announced guidance of $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by $22.4 million, or 10.5% to $234.9 million and adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points to 10.7% compared to 10.5% from the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment increased 10.1% to $138.9 million. And adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 9.8% to $0.67 compared with second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings of $0.61 per diluted share. This was near the top end of our previously announced guidance of $0.63 to $0.68 per diluted share. I am extremely pleased with the consistent growth in strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was our 30th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Second quarter result continue to validate relevance of the Dollar Tree brand, customers are shopping with us more often, we are attracting new customers everyday and when the customers are in the store they are buying more, both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter.. Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budget. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchants do a great job sourcing products that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandize values are better than ever and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector. Seasonal energy was high in May beginning with Mothers' Day in addition to party essentials our stores were well stocked with card gifts, gift bag, balloons and candy for mom. Seasonal sale through was good and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes and celebration surrounding Memorial Day, picnics pools, beaches and summer fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mothers' Day and Memorial Day, May was the strongest month for comp store sales in the quarter. For the full quarter, same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top performing categories include candy and food, party, snacks and beverage and household supplies. Geographically Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was the strongest in the Southwest followed by the Midwest, Southeast, Northeast and West Coast. All five geographic zones produced positive same-store sales in the quarter. We continue to invest in our customers by offering unbelievable values on many name brands and bonus buys especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. And not to forget the basic throughout the quarter we continue to highlight our million dollar brands with signage and special displays of those everyday items that provide terrific value to our customers. Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. In the second quarter, we opened a total of 130 new stores and relocated or expanded 27 stores for a total of 157 projects. The new stores included the 121 US Dollar Tree stores, 3 Dollar Tree Canada stores and two Deal stores. Additionally, on August 1st, we hosted grand openings at the first four of our re-bannered Family Dollar to Dollar Tree stores. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 7.8%. We ended the quarter with 5,583 stores and we are on track with our plan for fiscal 2015 which includes 400 new stores, 75 relocations and expansions for total of 475 projects across the US and Canada. In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive the business initiatives include category expansions where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. Seasonal relevance, our storefronts change with the season. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the season at the $1 price point. Merchandize energy and thrill of the hunt throughout of the store at Dollar Tree, you will always find an expected value. And being first of the month ready, we place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. Additionally, we are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezer and coolers in 159 additional stores for a total of 255 additional stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,875 stores and we continue to grow. Frozen and refrigerated merchandize is generally lower margin but its faster turning, more frequently purchased and increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories including our higher margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the need of our customers. We continue to support planned growth by building infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We've recently began construction of Dollar Tree DC 11, a 1.5 million square foot automated facility in Cherokee County, South Carolina. This facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the South Eastern and Mid Atlantic US. We plan to have the facility operational in third quarter of 2016. I am extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in second quarter. Our Dollar Tree business continues to deliver operating margins that lead the value retail sector, our customer base is large and growing, both traffic and average ticket increased in second quarter. We have an experienced and talented merchandizing team that continues to do a tremendous job of finding and delivering terrific values to our customers with margin that meet our threshold. In second quarter, merchandize margin increased over the prior year. We announced and began construction on Dollar Tree DC 11 and we completed the acquisition of Family Dollar immediately transitioning from integration planning to integration execution of the two companies. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I am more enthusiastic than ever about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. With the successful completion of the acquisition of Family Dollar on July 6, we are now much larger and more diverse organization, able to benefit from scale and deliver even greater values. With more than 13,800 stores across North America supported by a solid and scalable infrastructure, this combination provides the unique opportunity to leverage our multiple banners to better serve a broader range of customers while enhancing our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third year post closing. These synergies will be driven through four primary avenues. Sourcing and procurement, our rebranded program for optimizing store formats, distribution and logistics, and fourth overhead and corporate SG&A. As previously stated we expect to spend approximately $300 million in one time costs to achieve these synergies. Our priority areas of focus for Family Dollar will be on first of all the customer. We will be evolving the merchandize assortments to increase value and better meet their needs. The customer experience, creating a more exciting, inviting and customer friendly shopping environment. Lowering field management turnover, supporting our store initiatives and developing a more performance based culture throughout the company and increasing store productivity; we will be modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity in existing stores while improving new store remodel and expansion performance. Our 100 day action plan includes seven key initiatives. First of all, communicating organizational leadership changes and establishing management cadence and coordination. As planned effective on day one, Gary Philbin, my business partner for the past 15 years took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar and Mike Witynski was promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer at Dollar Tree. Immediately we began standing up work groups and establishing our weekly and monthly cadence across banner meetings. We began defining coordinated merchandize planning and buying across banners. We are consolidating reporting and financial management tools. We've created a stub-year plan to align the Family Dollar calendar with the Dollar Tree retail calendar by the end of the year. We are developing a combined real estate review and approval process. Our goal is to put the right banner in the right location to best serve the customer and to ensure we are using an appropriate pro form analysis with appropriate hurdle rates for profitability. We are completing our compensation and organization leveling review bringing both organizations to a common title hierarchy with a common compensation and benefit plan and the common calendar. Second, we immediately kicked our plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies. One of our largest synergy opportunities is using our size, scale and efficiency to buy better. We currently spend about $10 billion on items for resale and another $3 billion for products and services we buy for use in the business. Immediately following closing, our merchandizing teams met to share detail cost information to identify and quantify specific opportunities and to develop a strategic action plan to obtain the best cost in both banners. The cost of good sold initiative is focused in three primary areas. The first area is aligning exact match products carried by both companies and obtaining the lowest cost for both banners. Second is a review of similar match products. Here our merchants are aligning specifications and combining purchasing power to reduce cost. Third is payment term parity, which will benefit the combined company with savings from harmonizing payment terms. The plans have been developed, the initiative has launched and we are well on our way to achieving our goals of reducing cost to good sold. Additionally, our procurement teams are addressing our indirect spend. These are items and services that we buy that are used in the business. The opportunity to use our size and efficiency to reduce cost is significant. These items and services have been grouped into waves to be addressed over time through a blend of negotiations, auctions, RFPs and form of bid processes. This process has also begun and we are on track to achieve our first 100 day goal. Third, we have officially kicked off our store rebanner process. We are very excited about the opportunity to rebanner store locations to better server our customers while improving the overall productivity of these individual stores. Our initial focus will be transforming hundreds of underperforming Family Dollar stores into Dollar Tree stores. Using the Dollar Tree real estate model we are reviewing underperforming Family Dollar stores to determine if they would perform profitability as Dollar Tree stores. Upon closing we immediately began the process to rebanner four test stores. The test was to validate that we had all of the necessary steps in place to facilitate a smooth conversion. The individual stores closed for approximately two weeks as we liquidate the Family Dollar merchandize, convert the décor, signing and fixtures, train the store teams and bring in the Dollar Tree inventory. These first four test stores reopened on August 1st less than four weeks following the completion of the acquisition. While very early in the process, these stores experienced successful grand openings as Dollar Tree stores. We have since rebannered and opened 39 more for a total of 43 stores as of last Friday, August 28th with similar grand opening results. Going forward, we've developed a list of stores to be rebannered each week through the end of October and assuming continued success, we will reengage these efforts in 2016. By the end of October, we expect to have more than 150 stores converted. We are very pleased with the process and with early results, feedback from customers in these markets has been positive. Fourth and first 100 days we plan to establish cross organizational IT access and finalize our initial technology integration strategy. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have very good technology platforms and there are no significant gaps or immediate needs. Through our integration planning, we've developed a roadmap to strategically combine our technology over time. The timing of these changes will be driven by the size of achievable synergies versus the expected cost. Our current plan or roadmap includes four primary phases. Immediately in Phase one, we are addressing back office system consolidations. Phase two addresses system alignment related to transportation, workforce and HR support and business intelligence. Phase three addresses consolidation of core merchandizing systems including forecasting and replenishment. And Phase four addresses projects related to distribution and center management point of sale and real estate. This we are developing and initiated and plan to better serve the Family Dollar customers and to build sales momentum. Raising the table stake is a key priority and a significant opportunity in our integration efforts. Our first 100 day plans include clearing aged and non-productive inventory while improving our in-stock position on everyday basis. This includes reclaiming prime space for impactful displays for our fourth quarter seasonal and promotional assortment. And continuing the analysis of productivity by category. Sixth, we will be finalizing supply chain roadmap and initiating the multi banner supply chain project. Working with a cross banner functional team and third party supply chain consultant, we are developing plans for integrating our warehouse management systems. And making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing our space need by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners at of each facility. This is a very large project with a very significant opportunity for long-term synergies. Seventh, we are further developing and initiating plans to reduce cost with a shared services model. Over time we will be combining our efforts to support both banners with a shared service organization and human resources, finance, information technology, logistics, legal, strategy and audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization while reducing cost. This is a high level overview. Some of the components of our 100 day action plan. There are some quick and easy wins here and some that we will take a great deal of work. The timing of some will be depended on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall business for the long term. It is a process it will take time but the size of the prize is worth it. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015.
Kevin Wampler: Thanks, Bob and good morning. As Bob mentioned, we are pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparison for the next four quarters will be more complex than normal since there is no prior year data for the Family Dollar segment. Total sales for the second quarter grew 48.3% to $3.01 billion which includes four weeks of Family Dollar sales. Excluding the $812 million in Family Dollar sales the Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.3%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7% versus a strong 4.5% in the prior year second quarter. Increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.4%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $161.1 million, or 23.2%, to $855.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. Majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar gross profit of $105.9 million. A few factors to note are: as a result of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition, a preliminary purchase accounting adjustment of $116.3 million was recorded for the step-up in basis of Family Dollar inventory to its fair value. Of this amount, $55 million is amortizable of which $11.1 million was amortized during the second quarter to cost of good sold and negatively impacted gross margin results. We expect an additional $38.1 million will be amortized to cost of good sold over the remaining six months of 2015. During the second quarter we also took a $60 million markdown reserve for SKU rationalization and planned liquidation related to Family Dollar inventory that will not be carried going forward. Gross profit margin for Dollar Tree segment was 34.1% during the second quarter compared with 34.2% in the prior year second quarter. The 10 basis point decline as a percent of sale was driven by higher shrink and occupancy cost partially offset by improved merchandize cost. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 49.7% to $731.8 million from $489 million in last year second quarter. Majority of the $242.7 million increase related to $200.9 million of Family Dollar expense which included $6.5 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights recorded in connection with the acquisition and $6.5 million of additional deprecation for the harmonization of the combined company policies. For the second quarter we incurred $17.7 million, or 55 basis points of expenses related to the Family Dollar acquisition compared to $7.5 million, or 35 basis point of acquisition expenses in the second quarter of 2014. As a percent of sales SG&A expense increased 20 basis points to 24.3% in the second quarter from 24.1% in the same quarter last year. Excluding SG&A cost expenses as a percent of sales was consistent with the prior year at 23.7%. Adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment was $514.4 million, or 23.4% of sales. As a percent of sales this represent a 30 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2014 adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment of 23.7%. The decrease was driven by improved store labor productivity, lower incentive comp and lower legal fees as a percent of sales. Operating income for the combined organization increased to $123.4 million compared with $205 million in the same period last year. This decrease is a result of lower gross profit margin and higher SG&A expenses as previously mentioned. Adjusted operating income for the Dollar Tree segment increased $22.4 million to $234.9 million, or 10.7% of sales compared to 10.5% of sales in the prior second quarter. Non-operating expenses for the second quarter totaled $265.6 million and were comprised of the following. A $1.7 million expense due to an unfavorable fair market value adjustment on diesel fuel swaps, and net interest expense of $263.9 million in the quarter compared to $8.4 million in the prior year second quarter. This increase included interest on the long-term debt for the acquisition and $89.5 million breakage fee related to the prepayment of the Dollar Tree senior notes and a $39.5 million prepayment fee related to the term loan B refinancing. A $17.4 million write -off original issue of discount and $5.9 million write-off of deferred financing cost related to the term loan B refinancing. The quarterly run rate for interest expense going forward will be approximately $100 million including deferred financing cost and amortization. For the second quarter, the company had a net loss of $98 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. Excluding acquisition related adjustments the company had net income of $53.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment was $138.9 million, or $0.67 per adjusted diluted share, a 9.8% increase when compared to the reported adjusted earning per share of $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year second quarter. Effective tax rate for the second quarter was a benefit of 31.1% compared to an expense of 38.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of pretax income loss in the quarter and the non deductible acquisition cost. Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, combined cash and cash equivalent at quarter end totaled $1.3 billion compared to $467.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2014. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 6.7% greater than at the same time last year while selling per footage increased 7.8%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 1%. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support schedule new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. Consolidated capital expenditures were $100.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 versus $88.3 million in the second quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $600 million to $615 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels including additional fee development stores, rebanner of select Family Dollar stores and to Dollar Tree stores. The addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 425 Dollar Tree stores, up from the previous expectation of 320. IT system enhancements and the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution centre. Depreciation and amortization totaled $89.5 million for the second quarter versus $49.9 million in the second quarter last year. For 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million. This range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for two items. First it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the two companies and the increase in the value of assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease right for the purchase price evaluation of Family Dollar leases. For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $4.78 billion to $4.87 billion. For the full year of 2015 we are now estimating total sales will range from $15.3 billion to $15.52 billion. Both of these estimates are based on low single digit same store sales increase. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.7 million shares for Q3 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. Our expectations for the Dollar Tree segment of our business in the back half have not materially changed from our original expectation as we entered the year. However, as a result of the recently completed acquisition, the significant integration initiatives and the divestiture process, we are not providing earnings per share guidance for the third quarter or full year at this time. I'd like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that rebannered from Family Dollar to the Dollar Tree. We will experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comp as part of rebanner effort. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and outlook for same store sales in the back half of 2015. I'd like to briefly speak to the divestiture process. Related to our acquisition, we've reached an agreement to divest 330 Family Dollar stores to Sycamore Partners to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission divestiture requirements. These 330 stores represent approximately $45.5 million in annual operating income. We are on schedule to close on divestiture sale later this year. The closing of the divestiture transaction will not change our future net assets because the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet and Form 10-Q being filed today. The divestiture will have two effects on future income. In addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs, and setup costs related to transition services. Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months we will be providing certain support and transition services and expect to be reimburse by the buyer for these direct operating costs and support services. I'll now turn the call back over to Bob.
Bob Sasser: Thank you, Kevin. It is an exciting time for Dollar Tree. The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction evolving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers. The largest of any previous retail merger and it will take some time. It is early in integration process and is more enthusiastic than ever about the long-term opportunity to provide substantially increase shareholder value. We've great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year three. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering cost in both direct and in-direct sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and over head. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We are confident that placing our initial emphasis on these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvement in sales margin, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. Before we go to Q&A I'd like to introduce Gary Philbin to our call, effected immediately upon closing, Gary took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar. This is a key role that has been vacant for about 18 months and the organization was in need of direction and leadership following the lengthy acquisition process. Many of you already know Gary. We worked together improving and growing the Dollar Tree business for the past 15 years. And I have tremendous confidence in his ability as a retailer and as a leader. Gary?
Gary Philbin: Thank you, Bob. And good morning, everyone. First let me say we are only eight weeks into the integration. And we are enthusiastic about the initial progress and this incredible opportunity ahead of us. I am pleased with the dedication and focus of the entire Family Dollar team. As you know, Family Dollar is a well established brand that has been successful for more than 50 years. I think our Family Dollar business is not broken. We simply need to roll up our sleeves, focus on what's important and we have the work to do polish up this well known brand. Bob provided a high level, strategic overview of our 100 day action plan. I'd like to provide greater detail into the execution components in our areas of focus on improving the Family Dollar's customer shopping experience. Our goal is to consistently provide great value, affordable prices and relevant items in a store environment as convenient, clean, reliable and productive. To accomplish this goal, we are going to build on four basic fundamentals. Great product value, well run stores, smart choices for our customers and consistency of in-stock on everyday items. Nothing I said here is new to retail. This is really retail 101. We are focused on consistent execution combined with our relentless focus on our customer. It is important to understand that we will be making investments to improve what we refer to table stakes and these investments will include delivering on the consistency of a clean store benchmark, catching up on deferred maintenance, investing in the right amount of payroll to drive both productivity and enhance the customer experience and improving the overall efficiency of our in-store processes. Importantly, we are kicking off our process to clear non go forward merchandize in the stores. So you are likely to see clearance activity over the next couple of months as we gear up for having our shelf stock with basic everyday items and to show off our great seasonal product. This will have an impact on margins near term, but it is absolutely the right thing to do for our business in the long-term. Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I jus want to say again, I am proud to be part of the Family Dollar team. I am pleased with the work being done and I am excited about the opportunities this will present both to our vendor community and our Family Dollar team members as we improve and grow the Family Dollar brand. Now let me turn it back over to Bob.
Bob Sasser: Thank you, Gary. I want to close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever providing extreme value to customers while recording record level of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 30 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. With the addition of Family Dollar, we are larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more market with exactly what they are looking for, great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us. Over the past three weeks I have had the privilege to attend and present at both Family Dollar's Annual Leadership Conference and Dollar Tree's Annual Field Management Meeting. I could not be more proud of our combined organization. Our field management and our leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question we will hear from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.
Scot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys; Scot Ciccarelli. A couple things. Can you help us better understand the moving pieces on the Family Dollar side? It looks like even after adjusting for the charges, Kevin, that you outlined, gross margins was dramatically lower than their historical run rate. So whether it's kind of giving us year-over-year comparable figures or a way to kind of build up a bridge to what might be a go-forward run rate number, thanks.
Kevin Wampler: I think the big thing we got to keep in mind is there are some geography difference in the way we have historically reported our gross profit and the way the Family Dollar has. So you got to remember within our gross margin we have occupancy and distribution cost up there. So within that change has been made to Family Dollar reporting on a go forward basis. So that's probably the biggest difference that you'd see from a comparability standpoint from what it traditionally had been reported at Scot.
Scot Ciccarelli: Okay. And then -- I'll follow up on that. Then also as you guys kind of think about Family Dollar -- maybe this is for Gary -- it's obviously been an underperforming asset for the last couple years. It sounds like you guys have a lot of kind of go-forward opportunities to fix the business deep into the plans. But when you think about the profitability opportunity of that entity on a standalone basis, do you guys have some sort of medium-term or long-term profitability targets for the Family Dollar segment?
Gary Philbin: Hey, Scot. Thank you. I'd just say this we know the synergy piece that we are working on and this is going to be a bit of marathon, not a sprint. But the same things that we've talked about over the years that Dollar Tree play pretty nicely into Family Dollar. And I'd just go back to some of the basics we are working on. We are walking the assortments in the store 4 feet by 4 feet to get the assortment right and we are taking a look at store operations to understand how we improve their processes that drive productivity. And we are going to take a very hard look at all of our expense line so we can fund those things and we can invest in the customer experience. So it is really just connecting the same dots you heard us preach over the years here at Dollar Tree and those are going to be the levers we push to drive to the bottom line.
Bob Sasser: Scot, I'd like to add too that you mentioned the short term versus long term, I'd tell you this is -- we are going to manage this in the short term but it is a long-term vision that I am really excited about. It wasn't that long ago that Family Dollar's margins were in the 8% and higher range, operating margin and certainly those are in the -- in our near term sites over the next few years. In the long term, there are others in the sector that are operating at 11%, 12% operating margin. I don't think the operating margin will be as high as the Dollar Tree operating margin because of the nature of our business, the nature of our consumable versus non-consumable and discretionary business. But certainly can be as up there amongst others in the discount value sector.
Scot Ciccarelli: Bob, just to clarify, did you say you would expect or believe you can get the Family Dollar business to kind of an 8% margin over the next few years as you guys integrate it?
Bob Sasser: I just said that it wasn't that many years ago that it was at that, so certainly one of our first goals is to get it from where it is now up to where it has been in recent years. And then past that, there is no reason why we can't polish this thing up and get it back to its proper place which would be up there at the top with others of the same type business.
Operator: And the next we will move to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Grambling: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I think previously you had mentioned a low to mid-single-digit accretion to cash EPS in the first year from the acquisition, which I guess would now be fiscal 2016. Is that still on the table? Or has anything changed in your thought process as you've been able to maybe open the kimono a bit?
Kevin Wampler: As we look at that on a go forward basis, we've stated that back in July of 2014, obviously things took obviously a lot longer to close the deal than would have been expected when we made that. The Family Dollar business deteriorated little bit over that timeframe but time will tell, we don't think it is not possible. There is a lot of moving pieces. And the other thing you got to remember is long term we are really more worried about what the acquisition does for the long term. So we’ll have to see. I don't exactly know today if it will be, there is a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, we spoke to a lot of things today about some of the short-term effects from a purchase accounting standpoint, some of those things. And again some of those are non-cash; some of those do go through the P&L as a regular charge. So a lot of moving pieces and that's what makes it as complex as it is as we go forward from a comparison standpoint.
Stephen Grambling: Okay, thanks. I guess one other clarification just on the Family Dollar business. Is there anything you can talk to in terms of the underlying health and trajectory of that business and how that's factored into the sales plan for the year? Thanks so much.
Kevin Wampler: As we looked at it from a sales perspective as the Family Dollar team looked at that business, I think it really consistent with the guidance we gave of a low single digit comp gain that's really for the Dollar Tree side because the comps - and Family Dollar stores are not comped but I think in the back of our mind is the reason why they can't in a sense for focus in and perform at a level like that going forward. So I mean I think that's just kind of a general nature. We expect improvement and obviously we got to go through some processes, we talked about the fact that $60 million reserve to clean up the inventory for non go forward items, so there will be process there. We hope that obviously opens up shelf space as we go forward for seasonal goods as we go into fourth quarter and other items that we believe are important to the assortment as we go forward. So a lot of work being done and lot of moving pieces.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks so much. Good luck in the back half. Looking forward to seeing that 8% margin.
Kevin Wampler: Not in the back half.
Operator: And we’ll move on to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.
Matt Nemer: Good morning, everyone. Given your comments about the product value that you're looking to install in the FDO stores, I'm wondering if you think that the FDO merchandise margins need to be structurally lower than they have been in the past?
Bob Sasser: I'd say that I don't know that it’s -- they need to be structurally lower, I think it is all about the assortment to some degree serving that value customer, a lot of things go into that, first of all being competitive on name brands for same items between our company and other. We need to do that as always that just sort of one of the table stakes and past there is about the mix, is how do you create value especially for that low income customer, there is big opportunity with private label, there is a big opportunity for controlled label, there is a big opportunity for product development to create even more value for that low end customer. So as we speak of serving a low end customer and bring value to that customer, there is more than one way to do it. And it is not all about the price on name brand product. It is many ways about understanding that customer, giving them what they need; sometimes it is a lower retail item that doesn’t speak to the margin though, it speaks to the opening price point for that customer. So, no, I won't tell you that I expect Family Dollar margins to be lower because we are serving the value customer, I think it is all about the way we bring value to that customer.
Matt Nemer: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you talk to the stability of the FDO store managers and the field teams, now that you're kind of into the integration process?
Gary Philbin: We actually had a chance or timing is everything but we had a chance to went follow myself, get in front of the entire district manager leadership team at the beginning of August, so we had a great opportunity to lay out the elements that are important to us and what's we need short term focus on as we head into the holidays. So it was really a great opportunity to talk about what we need to do with our core store manage turnover is on our radar and something that we need to improve at Family Dollar. And so those issues and elements were lay down in front of the entire group. I'd tell you if they are encouraged, they are positive, they are enthusiastic to move forward and I think that's going to carry over to the stores and really some of the things that we are going to invest in over time in the facilities and address issues that make us more productive, and the types of things that benefit store manager. So I am encouraged. I think our folks have taken the opportunity and are going to carry it forward for us. And I'd expect to see improvement on store manager turnover which does a lot of good things for us over the long term.
Matt Nemer: That's great. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And next we move on to Michael Lasser with UBS.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So aside from some of the inventory dynamics that you mentioned, what else is going to impact your outlook from a profitability perspective in second half of the year? Because I think it is complex, and the fact that it is being left so open-ended may offer the impression that there's too many moving pieces for even the company to project. So how can the investment community be expected to forecast profitability?
Kevin Wampler: Well, I think in Gary's prepared remarks he touched on some of the items as you think about the moving pieces are still under consideration. When you think about the fact that we've only truly been under the hood eight weeks but and Gary talked about investments in cleaner store and the benchmark appropriately. Cleaning up deferred maintenance, making sure the stores are taken care of appropriately, determining what the right level of payroll is in this model to drive productivity and create a more profitable store at the end of today. So there are still a lot of moving pieces just from the integration side and then you have as well I said you have timing on the divestiture process side as well. Some point in time these 330 stores will be -- that are currently included in our base will go away and then we also have cost around that to help support that as we said and so the timing of those costs are not as they able be to be tied down maybe as tight at this moment as we would like. So there is a lot of moving pieces. I think we know what they are but it does create little more uncertainty in creating a number. I mean we are taking great pride and being able to provide credible guidance. And that's important to us. And we want to make sure that we have the best information to make those -- to be able to make that and give that to you at the end of the day.
Michael Lasser: So my follow-up is going to be a two-part follow-up. Based on those comments it sounds like the prior guidance for core Dollar Tree remains relatively intact on the profitability side. And the guidance, your commentary on the guidance also suggests that core Dollar Tree is probably going to do a 1% to 1.5% comp in the second half of the year to get to a low-single-digit comp for the year; and it also sounds like that's what it did in June and July based on what you were indicating that may have done. So my question is, A, core profitability for Dollar Tree intact and B, why might you be expecting a 1% to 1.5% comp for core Dollar Tree moving forward? And is that what we should expect longer term? Thank you.
Kevin Wampler: So look you are correct on core Dollar Tree profitability as I said in my prepared remarks, our view point on really the guidance we gave for Dollar Tree is most updated guidance which would have been at the end of Q1, really hasn't materially changed from that point in time, our view on the world is not really changed. As it relates to your question on comp, obviously we don't give a specific range by number value but low single digit is a wider range than 1.5 so I don't know we would expect 1.5 at the end of the day. So I think that would be how we would how we would answer that question.
Michael Lasser: Okay. Thank you so much and good luck.
Operator: And next move on to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.
Dan Wewer: Bob, I know that there is a lot of science involved in determining locations for Dollar Tree stores. When you look at the Family Dollar stores that have been selected for conversions, how would you characterize the quality of their locations by Dollar Tree standards? And do you think those stores have the potential to generate the same sales per square foot and operating margin rate that an average Dollar Tree store achieves? Or would you expect these converted stores to be somewhat below Dollar Tree profit standards?
Bob Sasser: Dan, I'd tell you that the first the Family Dollar site location I think that they are good site location. Some of them are little off the mark. And they are underperforming for that reason. As you know that over the past few years, I think they opened up a few more in suburban locations than maybe normal, I don't know if that what normal was but it seems like what has been told is that they were aiming more suburban locations. We see more suburban locations. And as we run those lower performing store, we are binding some of those world and suburban locations that are underperforming. That when we run through our model, they turned out to be good Dollar Tree stores and good Dollar Tree meet our Dollar Tree criteria for opening a new Dollar Tree stores. These are not -- these are sites that we would open as a Dollar Tree new store and we have been looking at those locations. So what we are taking is the lower performing stores or either lower performing because of their maybe little off the Family Dollar mark, they are lower performing because maybe the model, the pro forma weren't exactly aligned and by the way with our Dollar Tree margin, we can make a lot of money in a location, our margins are much higher than these Family Dollar margins are mixed of products is much different than the Family Dollar products. So long answer to your question but these are -- we are looking at these being good Dollar Tree stores. We are taking lowest performing and low performing Family Dollar, converting them into good Dollar Tree stores. Some of them are going to be breakout home run amongst the best of our Dollar Tree stores on sales per foot and some of them are likely going to be underperforming the first year. I believe that the breakout home runs will outweigh. We are early in this but I believe the breakout home runs will outweigh the underperformers and that most of them are going to be right there in the middle hitting whatever we expected from a Dollar Tree store. It is only been few weeks. We've only had some grand opening so far. But I'd tell you I am pleased with the grand opening and I visited the first four test stores when we opened them, I visit all four of them and they look like Dollar Tree stores and they look like Dollar Tree locations and they are in Dollar Tree town, customers were pleased to see our Dollar Tree open up in the place of the Family Dollar. So I am expecting to be at least as good as a Dollar Tree store.
Dan Wewer: All right. This is a follow-up question. After the acquisition was first announced -- it seems like 10 years ago -- but you talked about the opportunities of better buying leverage, common vendors. But it really wasn't until after the closing on July 6 that you were able to study the Family Dollar purchasing file if I am correct. Did it turn out that the buying leverage would be greater than what you have been talking about over the last year? Or did it turn out both companies were very effective in buying and maybe there's not going to be as much upside as anticipated?
Bob Sasser: Yes. I think it is at least as good in the near term. And I think there are may be even more opportunity in the long term. And where I am coming from as we sort of a new and the near term and we got very quickly to that exact match number. That's just a matter of running the file and in which items serve exactly the same and who is paying lowest price right? I mean somebody is paying, you're either paying the same or somebody is paying lower. If you are paying lower than we believe that both of us deserve that lower cost. That was pretty much as we thought it would be. The big I think power going forward in addition to that is going to be into the like items. Not exactly the same items but they are close that maybe a private label item that we compared too and expects a little difference of by aligning the specs and putting that out for bid but if it is basic item we think we know we can drive some more value by combining our buying power these two large businesses on those into product development just leveraging our buying power to develop product for our stores whether a Dollar Tree or Family Dollar. So huge opportunities continuing on the buying side. The near term is the exact match. The near match or the closed match like items I guess is taking a little bit longer but it may even be a bigger part of the synergies as we go forward. And they are not yet all the things that we buy that we don't sell, we just buying expense items and services and things that we buy to use, we spent $3 billion that we have to work with and every dollar we save on expenses drop right straight to the bottom line.
Dan Wewer: Just a real quick question. Do you intend going forward to continue breaking out the Dollar Tree core business separately as you get into the second quarter?
Kevin Wampler: We will try to get color, we are -- if you look at the Q, there is segment reporting even in the press release this segment reporting, so we will report on two segments. We will have the Dollar Tree banner and we will have the Family Dollar banner. So we will have segment reporting going forward. We will give you good idea of how things are performing.
Operator: And next we move on to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.
Paul Trussell: Good morning. Bob, you just spoke a bit to buying power and the opportunity there. Can you just clarify for us on the merchant team? Are those merchants still staying separate? And also how should we think about the category mix within FDO? Or should we expect meaningful changes there? Then lastly on that same point, as we think about the cadence of the $300 million in synergies, can you help us with what's a prudent assumption for year one? And what is the main driver of those year-one synergy?
Bob Sasser: Yes. Paul, the first of all the buying teams are staying separate. We have a terrific Dollar Tree buying team that's understands and is focused on delivering tremendous value to our Dollar Tree customer for a $1 price and margins that we are pleased to have. We have at Family Dollar a separate team focused on that lower income customer, the need based customer or more of consumer product customers 70 percent-ish something like that is consumer product, so the buying teams are staying separate. We are connecting them over the top through merchandize managers and divisional vice presidents and that area we are coordinating a buying with vendors. We are coordinating the activities on items and comparing buying plans and merchandize as we go on to buying trips as we go to Asia, as we go to market and wherever it is New York, going to shows and that kind of things. So a lot of coordination but we -- I believe it is very important to keep the focus clearly on the Family Dollar banner. We intend to continue opening Family Dollar stores as well as Dollar Tree stores. Sometimes they are pretty close to each other. So I'd like to be able to do that and have a very difference in the banners when you walk inside, have a difference in merchandize assortment. So the merchandize assortment at Family Dollar is evolving. It will be changing as I've discussed in the past the synergies -- I think we've said in the past 25% of the synergies in first year, we think we can get up to 75% of them by the end of the second full year and then 100% by the end of the three full year, so that's something like 75%, 150%, 75% something like that, 150% additional second year, 75% to 225% and 300% if you look at it that way. Then the early synergies are across the board. They are going to be a lot of sourcing and procurement. There will be some in banner optimization; I have said that we are going to do over 150 banner, new rebannering stores this year. So that's a real number. Over head we are working through that in every segment of our business. I mean that's going to be driven by our information technology integration. Some of it requires the integration of the technology for example in logistics, the ability shift both banners out of every building is going to require lot of technology help. So that will be probably later in the process, earlier in the process are the things about over head and improvements in SG&A through better procurement, more efficient procurement and through buying power.
Paul Trussell: That's very helpful. Thank you for the color. Just quickly going back to Dollar Tree standalone -- and I think Mike Lasser touched on this earlier. But could you just help us better understand the revision in the same-store sales guidance from the low-single-digit, to low/mid-single-digit, to now I think just low single digit guidance for the full year. What was the nature of that revision and if you can give us some understanding on the cadence of the comp through the second quarter and any early comments on back to school.
Bob Sasser: I can give you little color on the cadence of the comp. I initially said in the prepared remarks that May driven by couple of terrific holidays Mothers' Day, Memorial Day. You have that seasonal energy that holiday excitement, so that grow the highest comps for us. June was far behind; July was run pretty much consistent. We did lose first two to the month to end of July week, so some of that business slip forward anytime the first of the month falls on the weekend then checks come out in a different cadence in this case versus last year, all I came out at the first and the third came out last year this only the first checks came out. So there was a little slide in that final week of July. But overall it was fairly consistent through the quarter and again every time there is a great holiday we have a lot of energy in our Dollar Tree stores and you see more traffic and you see more sales from the holiday. Back to school started well, it is not over. One of the things that we are experiencing as well as all of retail I guess right now is Labor Day is a week later. Labor Day drives a lot of things in the retail business. It drives seasonal sales sort of the end of the summer I guess the pools close end of the summer for retailers, for customers and that's when a lot of the school start, some school run here around are realized some start different times, but still a large percentage of school start after Labor Day. Well, that's week later this year. So the sales cadence on our back to school looks good. But we still got haven't finished with back to school yet. So we will be finishing that up this weekend. It should be a terrific weekend in our Dollar Tree stores. If you have one near, drop in, you will see a lot of side walk sales and summer excitement and all that goes within summer season as well as get read to go back to school.
Operator: And we will move on to Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler: Hey, thanks very much for taking my question. Is there anything -- when you look at Family Dollar, I know you said that the delay in getting the deal approved put a little pressure on Family Dollar and made them a little softer. But is there anything that you've seen that comes as a surprise, specifically a negative surprise? And I guess I would go back to the question that was just asked. It does seem like your guidance for the second half for Dollar Tree's comp is a little bit softer. Is there anything -- is that right, softer than what it was? And is there anything you would point to that would explain why you feel that's going to be the case? Thanks.
Kevin Wampler: Meredith, as you look at the people seemed to be little hung up at the moment on this comp guidance. I'd tell you that the total sales related to Dollar Tree for the year have changed an immaterial amount within the guides compared to where they were a quarter ago. So one thing we did state in our prepared remarks was the fact that there is some cannibalization from the rebanner store and we are offset doing over 150, there is some cannibalization we feel from those and that may make us round down from mid-single digit to low-single digit, but I mean an overall basis. As I said we've not materially changed the way our view is on the Dollar Tree business for the back half.
Meredith Adler: Good. That is what I was thinking you were saying, but people didn't seem to be hearing it. Maybe you could just comment on then Family Dollar. Is there anything that has surprised you either positive or negative, since you've really gotten into it?
Gary Philbin: Hi, Meredith, this is Gary. Sometime on the ground there I would say, listen, I am enthusiastic because there is all the opportunities that we thought were there are there. And it's really matter of getting them in cadence and teeing them up and knocking them down. And I would say there is nothing on the negative side. We knew going in, how you enhance a customer experience, that's investing in some labor, that's investing in some store facilities, and those are big projects for us. And so we are going to be measured in disciplined and very prescriptive on how we do that and that's really the effort that we are putting together now to really lay out on a timeline on how we can do the things and show customers it is a fair shopping experience because we have better in-stock, we've better facility and we have team efforts engaged the way we like. And it's really just the nuts and bolts of retail and so what we are focused on we can recount down Family Dollar right now.
Meredith Adler: Well, that's great. Lots of luck. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have time for one more question. Next we will hear from Dan Binder with Jefferies.
Dan Binder: Hi, it is Dan Binder. Just going back to the sales plan for a minute, I was wondering if you give us a little bit of color on how disruptive it is when you close the stores and have to convert them. These four weeks, it sounds like it is kind of worth year -- it was recently. Is that what you're planning for the balance of the year on the stores that are remaining? And then within the Family Dollar business, I realize you are not reporting the comp today for their period. But I was curious when you think about your go forward plan kind of what's that underlying organic growth that we are assuming short term.
Bob Sasser: Dan, the first three bannered stores with the four that we rebannered that we started immediately after we closed July 6. We had the completely rebannered and open within 26 days so 30 days it is kind of what we are aiming at basically we closed in and go through a process ahead of time, we are selling through and liquidating the Family Dollar inventory. We then closed down for about two weeks, two more weeks to re-merchandize store, get the rest of the merchandize out there, get their old fixtures out, get the new fixtures in, and if you are already needed not always sometimes we use the same fixtures, get the new sign packages and the new décor package and re-merchandize the store. So it is about one month process and some of it starts ahead of time because we've identify the stores now at a time and we know which one we are going to do by month. So we do have a pre closing clearance, so Gary --
Gary Philbin: Dan, and just for the first four stores because we could not start markdown until we closed the transactions, they were accelerated. So the stores that we identify in the future and have -- give us a longer runway to appropriately do the markdown. So the first four really difference were we had to do this in a very short window, the team very well accomplished that and we got to the finish line. You will see a more measured timeline on the markdowns in the future.
Dan Binder: The other part of the question was the organic growth for Family Dollar Stores as we think about the full-year guidance.
Bob Sasser: I'll tell you they were positive in July, comp positive in July but they are new stores so it is less of comp story now and more of productivity story and obviously we are going to be go through a lot of changes remainder of the year, we are so excited about cleaning up the store, we are so excited about go through the process and rationalizing the assortment, getting rid of old and aged inventory and then replacing that in the space that's opened up from that with new seasonal products, new promotional product, new high value product in the store and what that will do for the customers and it is all in fourth quarter and we want our customers to see something different. Gary you'd like to -
Gary Philbin: Well, the short term is for us just to get very clearly in front of our cleaning up some of the old non go forward merchandize so that we can have merchandize on end-caps and the best seasonal impact as we can go to the important holiday season. From the standpoint of store growth initially there was a number around there around 550 on Family Dollar for their fiscal year, appropriately that drop down to about 300, so we have slowdown store growth as we take a look under the hood, take a look at the assortments to drive sales per square foot, I am sitting in on every real estate meeting to identify really what's the strategy, whether is it working or do we need to recalibrate, and so we will take a look on both side of that ledger, , where does Family Dollar work best and really more than anything how do we find the right compelling assortments and our operational initiatives to drive higher sales productivity.
Dan Binder: Then just as a follow-up, can you give us a little more color on how many stores you'll ultimately plan to convert? And as you go through this integration, slower Family Dollar store growth makes sense. I'm just curious as you think about the next two years beyond this year. I think you just said 300 for this year. What would you anticipate that to look like?
Bob Sasser: Dan, it is 150, more than 150 this year. With as many as we can get done between now and then end of October, obviously we want to stop at that point and pay attention to our fourth quarter business and then we pick up again next year. I have really not quantified the total number because there are still works in progress there. It is 100, I've said it is 100 and I believe it is 100 of stores that will have the opportunity, there is -- the analysis is ongoing as we go through more analysis we will get more firm direction the 150 plus number for this year was a new number, for a year probably that may be for next year we will share that as we get little more certainty on locations and where those are going to be.
Dan Binder: Yes, that was really sort of a two-part question. I'm sorry if I confused you. The 300, I was talking about new store openings for Family Dollar. I was just curious what that would look like during the integration period as you consider growth for the Family Dollar format next year and the third year.
Bob Sasser: Well, obviously we pull back until we can get there. There are more productive new store model. And more productive re-merchandize assortment in the store. We don't want to be investing and opening old lot of new stores until we know that we have -- what the model is and that has very success. So near term we pull back as Gary described, we pull back to -- when I say pull back from peak numbers that Family Dollar next will be pull back year also. That I think we got to say that as we get more confidence in the new model, we will ramp it back up, it is there to be done, there is plenty of room for the Family Dollar stores. We are excited about what we can do. We need this time for the rest of this year probably next year in order to get confidence that the new model and we will open stores but it won't be the peak numbers that we've seen in the past but little confidence that the new models are going to perform.
Operator: And now we will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Randy Guiler for any additional or closing remarks.
Randy Guiler: Thank you, Rochelle. And thank you for joining us for today's call. And for your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call is scheduled for November 24. Thank you and have a good day.
Operator: And now we conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation."
