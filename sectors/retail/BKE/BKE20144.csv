Gross margin for the quarter was 47.4%, down approximately 20 basis points from 47.6% for the fourth quarter last year.

For the fiscal year, gross margin was 44.0%, down approximately 20-basis point from 44.2% for the same period last year.

This was driven by an increased in equity compensation expense and certain other general and administrative expenses. For the fiscal year, general and administrative expenses were 3.3% of net sales compared to 3.1% for fiscal 2013, driven by an increase in equity compensation expense as well as increases in certain other general and administrative expenses.

For the full fiscal year, capital expenditures were $45.5 million and depreciation expense was $31.7 million. Year-to-date capital spending is broken down as follows, $31.2 million for new store construction, store remodels and store technology upgrades and $14.3 million for capital spending at the corporate headquarter and distribution center. We currently expect our fiscal 2015 capital expenditures to be in the range of $35 to $39 million, which includes primarily new store and store remodeling projects, IT investments and completion of the construction of a new office building as part of our home office campus in Kearney, Nebraska. For the quarter, UPTs increased approximately 3.5%, the average transaction value increased approximately 5%, and the average unit retail increased approximately 1.5%.

During the fourth quarter, we opened two new stores, completed one substantial remodel and closed three stores post-holiday, bringing our account for the full year to 16 new stores, 18 full remodels and six store closures.

We also anticipate completing 11 substantial remodels during the year. By season, we anticipate six of the remodel stores will be completed for spring and five will be completed for back-to-school. Planned new store openings for the spring, include stores in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, Omaha, Nebraska and Bradley, West Virginia. With that we will open it up to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ed Yruma of KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.
Ed Yruma: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dennis, kind of a bigger picture question first. 2014 was really the first kind of flattish earnings that you guys have had since 2008. I am just trying to understand was that the environment, was it denim, was there something you could have done differently and then I guess is this kind of the earnings trajectory we should expect from Buckle going forward?
Dennis Nelson: Good morning, Ed. I think it was a combination of things. The denim cycle in the ladies was a little more challenging after all our years of growth, so that was a little bit of it. I think the challenging environment was part of it, so a combination of things. I am sure that there’s things we are working on to continue to improve that we feel like we are in a very good position going forward. As you know we do not make forward projections, so thank you.
Ed Yruma: Got it, and a follow-up, I was wondering if you could give us an update on how the kids' assortment in the stores that have is performing and whether that is something you expect taking more spaces in the store. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Yes. We have been pretty happy with our kids business, and I know and the boys' part of it, we plan to expand more stores for back-to-school. Spring and summer, we are kind of maintaining the status quo for the number of stores we have, but it has been a nice plus, still a very small part of our business, but we do like it.
Ed Yruma: Great. Thanks so much.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Simeon Siegel representing Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
Simeon Siegel: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Dennis Nelson: Good morning.
Simeon Siegel: Karen, can you talk about the merch margin dynamics? With AUR up, but merchandise margins down is that mainly driven by mix? Then I guess maybe to the past question, how do you view the promotional environment in general, maybe what the right way to think about that going forward? Then just I think you had initially said it would be minimal, but can you just update was there any impact from the port strike? Thanks.
Karen Rhoads: Merchandise cover the port strike, but on the merch margin, I a little bit of that came from markdowns, It will be combined a little bit with product mix, but actually where we kind of cleaned up on the markdowns at the end of the year, I think, we felt pretty good about where that product is that the current time. I do not know, Dennis, if you have any further comments on…?
Dennis Nelson: I mean, it is pretty much a seasonal deal and kind of hits certain points, but we feel very good about our margin, our inventory, so we are ready for spring there. On the port strikes, well we did have several categories that impact to a certain degree and probably started toward mid-late November, we started seeing the impact and had deliveries anywhere from 2 to 10 weeks late, so that has had an effect in starting for spring.
Simeon Siegel: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys, and best of luck for the coming year.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
Karen Rhoads: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Thomas Filandro with SIG. Please go ahead, sir.
Thomas Filandro: Nice job on getting another quarter of solid business execution to all.
Dennis Nelson: Thanks.
Thomas Filandro: Dennis, could you expand or maybe Karen as well expand, a little more on that port comment, is there lingering issues here that we should be concerned about? Are you seeing any staggering of product coming in for the spring season then I have two other question just that one quick please?
Dennis Nelson: Okay. We still have some delays on some of our products. We had started to see a better pickup over the last 10 days on product coming in, but there could still be some impact to that business.
Thomas Filandro: The next question I have is sort of an odd question, but there has been some concern out there that your business could be negatively impacted in the so called shale states with employment issues. I was just curious if you’ve experienced any regional variance in the business and particularly kind of highlight those shale states. Then a question for Pat and Bob, could you tell us what you are seeing in terms of trends for either brands or silhouettes in denim and any comments about any churns in tops for spring. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Regards, the regional, through fourth quarter we did not see any real change in what was going on in our store, so I will defer to Bob and Pat now.
Thomas Filandro: Thank you.
Bob Carlberg: On the men side for denim, we are seeing some movement toward the straights or kind of the slimmer bottom opening and a lot of light and destructed seems to be working. From the top side, we just really continued to get past the competitors as far as bodies, fabrics, washes, colors, blocking just making the product a lot more interesting, so on a 360-degree look at the product, you would see details on all aspects of the product.
Thomas Filandro: Thank you, Bob.
Pat Whisler: Good morning. This is Pat. The denim side of the ladies, what I really enjoyed it that we kind of had a quite cycle there on denim, that was very singular focus and I see that opening up a little bit, which we are loving place kind of into our [strong] [ph] suit, more destructed denim, just the nice abrasion and a variety of fabrics and finishes, so we feel good about the denim picture. Our tops continue to be a great mix of private label and branded. We have a brand, in-house brand like Gimmicks, which is kind of a cornerstone brand for us and it is performing very well and just kind of enhances the whole top selection, but we are getting west coast brands a nice blend of in-house brands and overall feeling pretty good about the mix.
Thomas Filandro: Excellent. Best of the continued success.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
Pat Whisler: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we will go to line of Paul Alexander with BB&T Capital. Please go ahead.
Paul Alexander: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Just a follow-up on that denim point, do you think there is enough trend out there now, where you think you can again return women's denim to positive territory. Then a follow-up question, can you talk about increase in e-commerce growth in fourth quarter? Was that driven by new investments and projects and was it more clearance-related, and does that channels out performance versus stores make you think any differently about e-commerce investment going forward? Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: This is Dennis. I will take the girls denim part. We are seeing more interest in a variety of brands as well as what Pat mentioned as far as different finishes and we are still selling a variety of different fits, so we are encouraged with what we have going on there. Then, Kyle, do you want to comment on the online?
Kyle Hanson: Sure. We increased our support for paid search and that also led to some new acquisition strategies, primarily in fourth quarter and then or through some targeted display services, tested some of those and then actually increased our e-mail volumes.
Pat Whisler: This is Pat. Again, I might add to that, I think our teams did an excellent job of maximizing the inventory levels as we went into the quarter and getting us in good shape on our product selection. We also worked on enhancing our visual presentation of products online and have a team focused on that aspect going forward, and then there is more of an overlap there with merchandising and we had Kelli Molczyk who is working closely with that team as well.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Liz Pierce, representing Brean Capital. Please go ahead.
Liz Pierce: Nice job on the quarter. I am going to just kind of follow-up on a couple of the questions were already been asked. On the kids' business, Dennis, you mentioned that you are going to expand the boys, but I have noticed that there seems to be more kind of visuals on the web, but on all of them, so does that mean the girls was outperforming on the web versus the store?
Dennis Nelson: We started the ladies side more aggressively than the boys and actually 6 to 12 months kind of ahead of the boys, so we have expanded the product lines there and have a little more experience with it, so what you see for back-to-school is kind of the men's adding additional stores, you kind of have about the same levels as the ladies.
Liz Pierce: Okay, so basically playing catch-up?
Dennis Nelson: Somewhat, yes.
Liz Pierce: Okay. All right looks really cute, and I also just wanted to, I would say to Pat, on her visuals, because I think that the website was so much better and I was wondering if that had a lot to do with the year-over-year increase, but clearly if there were a couple of things. Anyway, that is all I have. Thank you and best of luck.
Pat Whisler: Thank you, Liz.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will go to line of Steve Marotta with C.L. King & Associates. Please go ahead.
Steve Marotta: Good morning, everybody. Can you please talk about e-commerce initiatives for the current year? What is going on there in order to drive increase sales? Thank you.
Karen Rhoads: Thanks for the question. In addition to working with the visuals as Pat mentioned, we are going to continue just to review our search programs as well as looking at strengthening of services [ph] through display and new acquisition, while making sure that we are watching our e-mail list of question [ph] rate and being wise in how we are spending our dollars there from a marketing perspective.
Pat Whisler: The only thing I can think to add there is we do have the same overlap onto our e-mail approach, which I think is working well.
Steve Marotta: Thank you. We will go to line of Lee Giordano with CRT Capital. Please go ahead. Mr. Giordano. Apparently, he took himself out of queue. [Operator Instructions] We will go back to Mr. Giordano's line. Please go ahead.
Lee Giordano: Hi. Can you hear me?
Dennis Nelson: Yes. Good morning. Lee.
Lee Giordano: Good morning. Just on the nine new stores for this year, wondering if that is the maximum if the plans are finalized or if you might be ramping that up even further. That is it. Thanks.
Dennis Nelson: I think that is possible that there could be another one or two added, but for planning stages, it is getting little late, so my best guess is it will stay at nine.
Lee Giordano: Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Yes.
Operator: Presenters, there are no other participants queuing up at this time.
Karen Rhoads: Okay. With no other callers coming in or questions coming up, we would like to thank everybody for joining us today, and wish everyone a great weekend.
