Karen Rhoads: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Our May 20, 2016 press release reported that net income for the 13-week first quarter that ended April 30, 2016 was $23.1 million, or $0.48 per share on a diluted basis, compared to net income of $33.6 million or $0.70 per share on a diluted basis for the prior year 13-week first quarter that ended May 2, 2015. Net sales for the 13-week first quarter decreased 10.2% to $243.5 million, compared to net sales of $271.3 million for the prior year 13-week first quarter. Comparable store sales for the quarter were down 11.1% in comparison to the same 13-week period in the prior year, and our online sales decreased 2.8% to $23.5 million. As noted in this morning's press release, net sales for the 13-week fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2016 are net of a $3 million adjustment recorded as a reduction to revenue to accrue for estimated future rewards related to the Company's new Guest Loyalty program. That program launched during the first quarter of this year. Absent the impact of this adjustment for estimated future rewards, our total net sales for the 13-week period ended April 30, 2016 were down 9.1% and comparable store net sales were down 10%. Gross margin for the quarter was 38.9%, down approximately 300 basis points from 41.9% for the first quarter last year. The decrease was driven primarily by deleveraged occupancy, buying, and distribution expenses resulting from the comparable store sales decline, which had about a 190 basis point impact, and by 120 basis points reduction in merchandise margins for the quarter, which were partially offset by a reduction in expense related to the incentive bonus accrual. Selling expense for the quarter was 19.5% of net sales, compared to 18.1% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with increases as a percentage of net sales in store payroll, marketing and certain other selling expenses, partially offset by a reduction in expense related to the incentive bonus accrual. General and administrative expenses for the quarter were 4.4% of net sales, compared to 4.3% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with increases as a percentage of net sales across several expense categories, partially offset by a reduction in expense related to the incentive bonus accrual. Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.0%, compared to 19.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Other income for the quarter was $408,000, compared to $736,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax net income was 37.3% for the first quarter of both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, bringing first quarter net income to $23.1 million for fiscal 2016, versus $33.6 million for fiscal 2015. Our press release also included a balance sheet as of April 30, 2016, which included the following: inventory of $138.8 million, which was up approximately 7% from inventory of $129.6 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015; and total cash and investments of $223.9 million, which compares to $231.5 million at the end of fiscal 2015 and to $202.5 million at the same time a year ago. As of the end of the quarter, inventory on a comparable store basis was up approximately 5%, and total markdown inventory was up compared to the same time a year ago. We ended the quarter with $172.4 million in fixed assets, net of accumulated depreciation. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $7.9 million, and depreciation expense was also $7.9 million. Capital spending for the quarter is broken down as follows; $6.6 million for new store construction, store remodels and store technology upgrades, and $1.3 million for capital spending at the corporate headquarters and distribution center. We still expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditure to be in the range of $31 million to $35 million, which includes primarily new store and store remodeling projects and certain IT investments. For the quarter, both UPTs and the average unit retail decreased slightly, with the average transaction value down approximately 1%. Buckle ended the quarter with 468 retail stores in 44 states, compared to 463 stores in 44 states at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Additionally, our total square footage was 2.383 million square feet as of the end of the quarter, compared to 2.345 million square feet at the same time a year ago. And now at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Heacock, our Vice President of Finance, Treasurer and Corporate Controller.
Tom Heacock: Good morning and thanks for being with us this morning. I'd like to start by highlighting the performance from our various merchandise categories for the quarter. Men's merchandise sales for the quarter were down approximately 4.5%. Average denim price points increased from $94.15 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to $95.85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. For the quarter, our men's business was approximately 45.5% of net sales compared to 43.5% last year, and our average men's price points increased approximately 2% from $55.05 to $56.10. Women's merchandise sales for the quarter were down approximately 12.5%. Our average denim price points decreased from $97.85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to $93.95 in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. For the quarter, our women's business was approximately 54.5% of net sales compared to 56.5% last year, and our average women's price points decreased approximately 1.5% from $51.05 to $50.20. For the quarter, combined accessory sales were down approximately 4.5% and combined footwear sales were down approximately 5.5%. These two categories accounted for approximately 8% and 6.5% respectively of our first quarter net sales, which compares to 8% and 6.5% for each in the first quarter last year. Average accessory price points were up approximately 2% and average footwear price points were down slightly. For the quarter, denim accounted for approximately 43.5% of sales and tops accounted for approximately 28%, which compares to 42% and 29.5% for each in the first quarter of last year. Our private label business was up just slightly as a percentage of net sales and represented approximately a third of sales for the quarter. During the quarter, we did not open any new stores but completed six substantial remodels. As of the end of the quarter, 386 of our 468 stores were in our newest format. For fiscal 2016, we now anticipate opening five new stores, which include three for back-to-school and two for holiday, and we also anticipate completing 19 full remodels which includes one that has already moved back into the remodel space in May, two additional for Spring, seven for back-to-school, and three for holiday. And with that, we welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Tiffany Kanaga: Looking broadly across the retail, we're seeing this slowdown in apparel. How are you thinking about your strategy in a tough mall environment, and in particular how do you think you can get the traffic and excitement and get the customer interested in shopping for clothes again, and in particular with respect to your denim category?
Dennis Nelson: This is Dennis. We are continually working hard on our product selection. We feel that we're seeing a little bit of change of some of our brands that have been very strong for us for several years now, coming off their peak, still is a good brand for us. We are developing new fits, we're seeing the selection from low to medium to high-rise in the girl's denims, a variety of stretchy fabrics and we're putting in more variety in our brands. So we feel that's a plus. For the spring season, that was probably encouraging, too tight a rein on some of the girl's tops. And so with our inventory down there, that has probably had a little effect, but the team has got a good plan and a great selection going forward starting within the next 30 days. So we think that will be exciting. Our men's product again looks strong and the store teammates, the feedback is good on the product selection, and we think with our specialty store approach to service and unique and exclusive products, that that's going to win the guests back. And now I'll see if Kelli Molczyk, our VP of Ladies, and Bob Carlberg, our VP of Men's has any other comments.
Kelli Molczyk: I just complement what Dennis said on the selection. I think we do have some good things going and the response on the newness from the stores and the guests have been nice. So we're encouraged by what we have ahead of us and we're optimistic.
Bob Carlberg: Yes, and so the men's denim is meaning more things to people. There is a lot of specialty fibers out there that we've been using for a long time, that we're doing a better job of calling out whether that's stretch in men's, CoolMax, Thermal Hike, and some of the soft fibers. So there's some newness in denim that the guests has had a good response to.
Tiffany Kanaga: And I have one more question. Is there anything that you can call out from the quarter looking at the negative online sales growth or is that just part of the broader trends, and if you could discuss any plans around mobile too?
Dennis Nelson: On the online business, I think it's mainly a part of the broader trend. And then Kyle, do you want to comment on the mobile?
Kyle Hanson: Sure. Our Web-site is optimized for mobile but we are continuing to look at ways that our mobile can also encourage that in-store experience.
Tiffany Kanaga: All right, thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please go ahead.
Julie Kim: This is Julie Kim on for Simeon. So I just had a question about your Guest Loyalty program. How is that progressing and any insights on how you think it will impact your margin and top line?
Dennis Nelson: Tom or Karen, do you want to take that one?
Tom Heacock: I think we've been very pleased with the response, and we've talked about [indiscernible] we've been working on and we're very excited to have that launched in the stores and the response from both our teammates and our guests has been very positive. We're seeing the majority of our transactions in the stores attributed to Guest Loyalty guests, and so we are very pleased by that. And what was the second part of the question, the impact going forward, I think we will continue to monitor and while we are winding down our old Primo program and ramping up the new Loyalty, there will be a little bit of an impact to margins, but that would dissipate going forward, and really as far as actual gross margins would not have an impact.
Operator: The next one is from Jessica Schmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.
Jessica Schmidt: I guess just given there's still just little top line trends and drop in operating margin this quarter, what changes are you making to manage the cost structure? So I know that the first half usually need the higher comp to drive margin expansion, but I guess should we expect this level of margin deterioration going forward or are there levers in the business that you could pull to maybe better manage the costs this year if the difficult environment does continue?
Karen Rhoads: We continually monitor our costs and obviously try and be as efficient in categories where we can be, especially in some of the discretionary spend, we watch that during the year. But you're correct, in the first two quarters of the year the leverage points are much different than in the back half.
Jessica Schmidt: Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, can you talk about some of the changes that you're making to the woman's assortment, and I guess what are you seeing from the initial testing that you are doing I think it was for some of the new merchandise for back-to-school?
Kelli Molczyk: We're definitely going after just new ways to keep it fresh, whether that's new brands or a new look within our product assortment. We've introduced some new brands over the quarter which has been favorable to the guests and the stores. So we'll just continue to react that way as well as impacting the trends through 'Buy Now, Wear Now'. So it might be impacting it on more of a consistent basis with newness.
Operator: Next is from the line of Doug Drummond with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Douglas Drummond: Just a thought on weather, do you guys see anything worth noting in the quarter? I know Texas, Eastern Texas had some pretty harsh flooding going on. So was there any impact to traffic or comp in the quarter from that?
Dennis Nelson: We try not to use weather as part of the factor. I know throughout the middle part, from Texas straight on up north, we had record rain in April here in Nebraska, and that feels like it's been much wetter and cooler than normal spring. So if that's true elsewhere, that would be part of the factor, yes.
Douglas Drummond: Great. And also just in regards to CapEx spending and IT, can you elaborate a little more I guess what you are targeting on that?
Tom Heacock: As far as the range for this year is 31 to 35, and the majority of that would be store projects which would be the five new stores and the 19 remodels. And then as far as how much of that is IT spending, I don't know that we have specifically broken that out. The biggest project, we are in the process of transitioning to a new Web platform and hopefully we'll do that by the end of the second quarter. So that's the biggest IT project and then there will be other ones, but that's the first and probably most important.
Douglas Drummond: Okay, great, that helps. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Paul Alexander with BB&T Capital. Please go ahead.
Paul Alexander: Dennis, a really big picture question, maybe the biggest picture question here, it sounds like you see some opportunities to do better job of merchandising or buying but a lot of retailers out there talking about bigger sea changes in retail related to weak traffic, e-commerce, competition from other draws on spending like athletic, tech, beauty, dining, et cetera. So a number of competitors are talking about making bigger changes to their business model like changes in real estate, efforts to grow in mobile and e-commerce more, one has even bought a small restaurant group. So how do you see the world right now? Do you agree with some of the other retailers out there that things are fundamentally changing, and to the extent that you do, what are you adapting in your business model?
Dennis Nelson: There certainly is a lot of change going on. On the real estate side, we watch and work hard with our real estate program and re-evaluate our assets and leases continually, and in some cases we have them on shorter-term leases to give us flexibility. We still are focusing on the best place to shop and good communities and still see value there. As Kyle mentioned, we are working on a new Web-based platform. So we want to make our shopping experience better there. And it doesn't happen overnight but we're continually trying to involve our stores and Internet where it's very good for our best customers wherever they want to shop, and still using – we have very talented staff in our stores of managers promoted from within and lot of key teammates and stylists there that we're working for not only fit appointments in the store but how we could help them when they are too busy to shop the store, how we can be in touch with them and get them outfits and what they need for events. So we will continue to evaluate what's the best way our guests wants to shop and how we can help them, put the outfits together and give them great unique product and exclusive product. I don't see our niche venturing into restaurants or some of the other things. We feel that we can just continually improve on what we do and make that better so we'll win our guests over. There's still a lot of people that might think us as a younger store and we actually probably sell more product to guests over 25 and maybe even 30 as we go forward, and so just getting the better job of getting that word out and how happy they'll be to shop is kind of one of our goals.
Paul Alexander: Thank you. That's helpful. If I can just follow up on one point, you spoke a little bit about your real estate program. With trends as they are, do you foresee needing to increase store closures at any time or maybe reaching an equilibrium point in the chain where closures balance openings, like at 475 stores, or 400 to 500 stores, or something like that?
Dennis Nelson: We haven't put a number on it and the different communities change quite a bit in shopping areas, so we just continually re-evaluate, and if the economics makes sense and we have the people to manage, we are willing to stay the location even if it's not at a Company average of sales, if the economics are right and we already have everything in place. But we think it's a great time to position our best stores, remodel in stronger situation, there is a lot of good centers out there and works well for us. But with the changes and if the economics are not right, we will certainly be open to closing stores in the future. And we have also opened some in some very good markets that could affect existing stores, but we'll just see how it plays out and make those decisions when the time comes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Now to line of Steve Marotta with C.L. King & Associates. Please go ahead.
Steven Marotta: Could you please go over the denim, I think I missed it, as a percent of the total mix this year versus last?
Dennis Nelson: I believe they called out that the denim was 43.5% this year and compared to 42% in the first quarter last year.
Steven Marotta: Because that increased, what was the category that was most negatively affected in the quarter?
Dennis Nelson: Probably our tops, I think the tops accounted for 28% this year and last year it was 29.5%.
Steven Marotta: Thank you. Also, could you talk if there was a material comp differential in energy-related markets?
Dennis Nelson: We certainly had an effect in the very heavy oil markets. We have not broken that out on how much difference there is, but in [indiscernible] North Dakota or certain areas that are very dependent on oil, it certainly has had a difference.
Steven Marotta: Just one last question, could you speak to roughly what percent of your sales come from markets you would consider heavy in energy?
Dennis Nelson: I don't think we have that number. Do we? No, I'm sorry, we don't.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in queue at this time.
Karen Rhoads: With no further questions, we really would like to thank everyone again for joining the call, and at this time that will conclude our conference call. I'll let you read the playback information.
