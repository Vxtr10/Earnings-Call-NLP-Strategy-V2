"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Buckle’s 2021 First Quarter Earnings Release. Members of Buckle’s management on the call today are Dennis Nelson, President and CEO; Tom Heacock, Senior Vice President of Finance, Treasurer and CFO; Kelli Molczyk, Vice President of Women’s Merchandising; Bob Carlberg, Senior Vice President of Men’s Merchandising; Brady Fritz, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. As they review the operating results for the first quarter which ended May 1st, they would like to reiterate their policy of not giving future sales or earnings guidance and have the following Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Tom Heacock: Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. Our May 21st, 2021 press release reported that net income for the 13-week first quarter ended May 1st, 2021 was $57.3 million or $1.16 per share on a diluted basis, which compares to a net loss of $11.8 million or $0.24 per share on a diluted basis for the prior year 13-week first quarter ended May 2nd, 2020 and net income of $15.1 million or $0.31 per share on a diluted basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Net sales for the 13-week first quarter increased 159.2% to $299.1 million from net sales of $115.4 million for the prior year 13-week first quarter. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales increased 48.6% from sales of $201.3 million. Online sales for the quarter were $53.7 million, an increase of 67.3% compared to $32.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of 120% compared to $24.4 million in the first quarter of 2019. Again compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, UPTs decreased approximately 0.5%, the average unit retail increased approximately 4.5%, and the average transaction value increased about 3.5%. Gross margin for the quarter was 49.3% compared to 23.2% in the first quarter of 2020 and 38.1% in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in gross margin compared to 2019 was the result of a 315 basis point improvement in merchandise margins, coupled with significantly leverage occupancy buying and distribution costs as a result of the strong sales performance for the quarter.
Kelli Molczyk: Thanks Tom. I would like to start by highlighting the performance of our women's merchandise categories for the quarter. Please note that due to the disruption in the prior year, all sales comparisons will be against the first quarter of 2019. Women's merchandise sales for the fiscal quarter were up approximately 46.5% against the first quarter of fiscal 2019. For the quarter, our Women's business was approximately 49% of sales; average denim price points for the quarter were $76.20 compared to $75.85 in the first quarter of 2020 and $76.70 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Overall price points for the quarter were $45.50 compared to $44 in Q1 of 2020 and $42.65 in the first quarter of 2019. In reviewing our first quarter results, we continue to be pleased with how the women's product is resonating with our guests and our teammates. Denim continues support performed nicely in a wide variety of fit from traditional to fashion; finishes, from clean to busted; fabrics, from super stretch to rigid; and bottom openings from skinny to flare. Our full length denim alternatives and crops and shorts also continue to perform well. As we all gradually transition to more out of the home living, we saw a nice uptick to our fashions out mix, our graphic tees, fashion and casual footwear, and accessories as guests look to step out with their best fashion foot forward. Our private label footprint continues to expand in all categories creating one of a kind product fit for our guests. Our regular price business continues to drive sales with our markdown inventory representing a smaller percentage of the total. Exclusive product mix combined with more regular price sales have had a positive impact on our merchandise margins. In addition, with the enhancements to our omni-channel experience, we saw nice gains in our online business for the quarter. With the sales performance beating our plan, the team worked extremely hard throughout the quarter to fill in any gaps in product flow by chasing in-season available goods from our valued partners as well as working through early shipments where applicable. Those at once goods in conjunction with a steady flow of new planned spring inventory, continue to set our stores up with fresh product for our guests. We continue to plan for a healthy flow of newness through the second quarter to prepare stores for the back-to-school season. And with that I'll turn it over to Bob Carlberg, Senior Vice President of Men's Merchandising to discuss the performance of our Men's Merchandise categories.
Bob Carlberg: Thank you, Kelli. Men's Merchandise sales for the fiscal quarter were up 48.5% in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. For the quarter, our Men's business was approximately 51% of net sales. Average denim price points for the quarter were $86.20 compared to $84.85 in the first quarter of 2020 and $86.70 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Overall price points for the quarter were $15.20 compared to $50.95 in Q1 2020 and $50.60 in Q1 2019. Q1 was a great quarter where all departments were up compared to 2019. Denim provided our largest growth in dollars with footwear in youth showing the largest percentage gains. The strong denim performance was across the board with particular strength and BKE and Salvage, both of which are exclusive to the Buckle. Rock Revival also had an amazing quarter and our Street brands continue their growth as a percent of the total assortment. In accessories, hats, Oakley sunglasses, and fragrance led the way. The team has been working quickly to replenish our inventory position throughout Q1 and into Q2, given the incredible guests response to new receipts going all the way back to Q3 of 2020. Our team just did an incredible job of working with our brands and sources to get enough product to sustain an incredible quarter of growth. Our usual low level of markdown inventory is even lower, giving us the ability to manage risk while we work to add more inventory. Our strong partnerships with the brand sources put us first in line to get product made and delivered faster than our competitors. During the quarter, there were many challenges in the supply chain overall, that we have been able to deliver most product on time, with only a small percentage of product being two plus weeks late. Now, turning to results in a combined basis, accessory sales for the fiscal quarter were up approximately 50% against the first quarter of fiscal 2019, footwear sales were up about 118.5%. These two categories accounted for approximately 8.5% and 11% respectively at first quarter net sales. This compares to 8.5 and 7.5% for each in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Average accessory price points were approximately 6%, while average footwear price points were down about 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Again on a combined basis for the quarter, denim accounted for approximately 42% of sales and tops accounted for approximately 26%. This compares to 46% and 27.5% for each in the first in the first quarter fiscal 2020 and 42.5% and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. For the quarter, our private label business represented approximately 38% of sales.
Operator:  And our first question will come from the line of Steve Marotta representing C.L. King & Associates. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Marotta: Good morning, everybody. I just like to speak a little bit about the supply chain. You mentioned some places it's running about two weeks behind. Can you talk a little bit about maybe where it was at the beginning of the quarter? Where it is now? And when you think the point of this year where we'll reach equilibrium?
Dennis Nelson: Good morning, Steve. Thank you for the question. Bob, do you want to address the men's product first?
Bob Carlberg: Sure, we've -- we kind of moved I think quicker than others and had things on order earlier to kind of already take into account the fact that there would be some changes in shipping that we knew about ahead of time. So, overall, I don't think it's going to have a material impact on our deliveries going forward and we should be building inventory in the next couple of months.
Dennis Nelson: Kelli, do you have anything to add?
Kelli Molczyk: No. I mean, I would echo what Bob said, we had fairly -- very little impact from the first quarter. Few partners ran into some challenges. But overall, we feel we fared fairly well and we'll continue to do so as they move forward.
Dennis Nelson: Steve, I might add that--
Steve Marotta: That’s helpful.
Dennis Nelson: I might add that you know with very strong fourth quarter as well as the huge gains in March and April, it's been a good problem for us to have. And the good news is all the product we're bringing in now continues to be fresh. And we have good sales history the past six months to develop product on.
Steve Marotta: That's helpful. Can you talk about your online penetration, maybe in its current form, as latest as you can, I don't know if you want to take the whole quarter or whether you want to take April as proxy months. But where is it at this moment in time? Are you seeing more strength in bricks-and-mortar as retail is reopening? Or is up on a dollar basis, I'm assuming digital is holding its own? Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the puts and takes there.
Dennis Nelson: Yes, I believe April, Tom was the brick-and-mortar was up 38%, is that correct?
Tom Heacock: I think for the whole quarter, and then that's part of the story. We've seen growth in both online and the stores. I mean seeing guests really, really excited to be back in the stores. For the whole quarter, in-store sales were up over 35%, which was incredible and coupled with our online growth. We have some difficult comparisons for online growth to a year ago for the periods where the stores were closed. But for the whole first quarter, I mean, our online sales were about 18% of sales and that's certainly a level we feel comfortable with and want to continue to grow.
Steve Marotta: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator:   Speakers, I'm not getting anybody else queuing up right now.
Dennis Nelson: If there's no questions, we can wrap it up quickly today and give everyone some time back and hope everyone enjoys the day and has a wonderful weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: We did get one more person to queue up right at the end. Would you like to take that?
Dennis Nelson: Sure.
Operator: Okay. Mr. Wang, please go ahead, sir.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, many of you appear, already talked about the big impact from the stimulus checks, just wondering if you have a way of measure how big that impact is in March and April sales. And more importantly, going into the second half of the year, you mentioned back-to-school, and there's holiday season too, assuming we are not getting any more stimulus checks, how do you think about sales trend, are they going to be continuing to going upwards compared to 2019? What are you thinking or planning to do to drive that uptrend? Just want to give some thoughts from you guys. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: I believe the -- the trend -- we won't try to predict the future, but since the fourth quarter of 2019 and even before, we had a lot of very good things going on in our company, our teams. Our merchandising teams have had great product and response from the guests. Our sales teams have been training to excellent experience. Our marketing continues to improve; the IT team has made the shopping online even more satisfying for everyone. And so we're just real excited on what everyone's accomplished over the last year and a half and looking forward to the future.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from line of Kyle Kavanaugh representing Palisade Capital. Please go ahead, Mr. Kavanaugh.
Kyle Kavanaugh: Good morning everybody. Thanks for the call today. I had a question about -- clearly, the environment is still different, we're on the other side of last year, and you're seeing all the benefits that are coming along with that. And some of that's coming through on your margins and you referenced some of the benefits you're getting whether or not it's merchandising margin and full price selling. And then also, I think on your call last time, you referenced real estate was a benefit. You were able to negotiate some of your real estate dynamics as well. So, I'm just curious, I know you don't want to forecast like sales trends going forward, but I'm curious about the productivity of the company and the ability to sustain margins going forward. Is there some of these benefits you're receiving right now sustainable, or some of them are going to be given back as we even normalize in the second half of this year into 2022. I was wondering if you can expand upon those thoughts a little bit.
Dennis Nelson: I think that's hard to say and thank you for the question, Kyle. I mean, in terms of merchandise margins and I'm looking at markdown inventory at the end of the quarter, I mean, we're -- Bob and Kelli both called that were particularly low. So, we're always seeking improvements in merchandise margins looking what we can do from a sourcing perspective, but difficult to project. And that's been the answer for the last, I mean, several years, and we've maintained merchandise margin at a really high level and continue to build on those. In terms of the rest of the cost structure, we're looking at a lot of areas where we got benefit. We talked about rent. We have worked to reduce rents over the last several years; they're seeing the benefit of that and that will continue out into the future in terms of reduced rents. We're also looking for opportunities to move stores out of underperforming malls into outdoor power centers, lifestyle centers, that's been a positive thing, both for rent and then the presentation of product in those stores and the results of those stores. So, I had five of those remodels in the first quarter, I think three last year and we'll continue with that strategy going forward. The other big piece is store labor and that's been a big focus going back for several years, we've had nice improvement there, I don't think we'll continue to see it at the level we did in the first quarter. It was sales far exceeding plan, I mean, was really close to hold that level of business and certainly we weren't staffed to holiday. And so the teams have been hiring and working hard and running really fast to take care of our guests. But I don't think we'd expect that same level of leverage on store payroll, but most certainly we'll continue to be as smart as we can and we'll see -- hopefully see some leverage and continue to focus on that.
Kyle Kavanaugh: Just a couple more questions. Are you able to give your traffic -- like traffic in the inline stores? I know you gave same -- comparable store sales? I mean, actually, you didn't give comparison -- could you give traffic levels in the -- for the quarter?
Dennis Nelson: We don't have traffic counters in our store. So, it's difficult -- and we don't have specific traffic metrics to share for our stores.
Kyle Kavanaugh: And then with your vendors, just kind of -- are they anything any supply chain? Or what is kind of -- what has been the -- I'm just curious; you said you have enough sales data now to forecast, where you want to go in merchandise. But, it is early so I'm just -- is it just kind of -- is everything selling well, because you're very low inventories and everything is new to the customer or is it -- actually like a fashion trends that exists right now? Kind of just some dynamics around that.
Dennis Nelson: I think it's pretty much product-focused. I mean, as Kelli mentioned in her presentation, there's a lot of lot of fun, exciting things going on in the gal's denim area with different silhouettes. Denim shorts working well. The variety of tops and such has been very well received. That's been great. And the men's side, denim has been very good as well, the short business; their selection has been very well-received as well as our knit business in both categories have been excellent. The footwear has been on trend and so the team has just done a very good job and our staff in the stores have been getting behind it. Our vendors, for the most part, will be helping us catch up. They have certain challenges naturally as the production goes. But overall, we think we'll be in good shape as we continue through the season.
Kyle Kavanaugh: Okay. And just one last question on the labor side, would you characterize yourself, as you know, staffed well enough for today's environment? And then as we move throughout the year, do you need to increase staff within stores or online or both?
Dennis Nelson: I'd say in the majority of our stores, they're in pretty good shape on the staffing needs. Certainly as we go to the back half the year, we're always looking to add people and there might be certain markets that it's more of a challenge than others. We got a great working environment and exciting company and can be competitive, so we don't see that as a huge problem.
Kyle Kavanaugh: Can I ask you paying minimum wage or have you moved your labor scales at all?
Dennis Nelson: We've raised our base wage and then its commission so -- this -- some of the new teammates be guaranteed minimum or their base plus commission, whichever is better and then we have more experienced staff that would be at higher levels.
Kyle Kavanaugh: Okay. Thank you so much, everybody. Appreciate it.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you. Yes.
Operator: And we do have a follow-up from Mr. -- or we have a question now from Mr. Hillenbrand  who is a private investor. Please go ahead. Your line is open, Mr. Hillenbrand.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Just like to get some information on the growth of your online sales and how your net margins online are compared to your sales in-store. And just what the trends have been as far as that goes?
Tom Heacock: In terms of margins, they're pretty comparable. There's not a lot of difference in the product or the merchandise margins of the goods that we have online. And what we have in store and in terms of growth that we've seen, a big part of the story is the omni capabilities that we've added over the last several years and exposing all of our in-store inventory to be available for sale online and so shipped from store has been a big part of our online growth and again, really expanding the inventory, giving the guests a better selection of product, reducing stock outs online, and that's been a big driver.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Tom Heacock: Does that answer your question?
Unidentified Analyst: It does, yes.
Dennis Nelson: Operator, do we have more questions?
Operator: And there's no other participants queued up at this time, gentlemen.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
Operator: Would you like to conclude the call?
Dennis Nelson: Now, we'll wrap it up and once we get any more last minute questions, but thank you everybody for participating and have a wonderful day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."
