Dennis Nelson: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we turn it over to Tom to walk through the financial results for the quarter, I want to take this opportunity to thank all our outstanding teammates for their hard work and contributions during the past year.Our strong operating results during the quarter which included comparable store sales growth of 3.3% and 270 basis points of operating margin expansion completed a positive fiscal year and have us well positioned heading into 2020. These results are a testament to the commitment and dedication of our many talented teammates to our mission of creating the most enjoyable shopping experience for our guests.The fourth quarter highlights included 160 basis points of merchandize margin improvements as both our men’s and women’s merchandizing schemes did an outstanding job of providing for our guest with the unique and exclusive selection of both branded and private-label merchandize across several product categories allowing us to reduce markdowns and improve the sell-through rate for the regular-priced product.We also did a nice job of managing operating expenses during the quarter, including a 75 basis point reduction in store labor expense. Even with the reduced payroll, our sales team continues to provide best-in-class service to our guest making us their favorite specialty store.And with that, I will turn it over to Tom.

Kelli Molczyk: Thanks, Tom. I would like to start by highlighting the performance of our women’s merchandize categories for the quarter. Women’s merchandize sales for the fiscal quarter were up approximately 6.5% against the prior year fiscal quarter. Average denim price points decreased from $76.65 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to $76 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.For the quarter, our women’s business was approximately 43.5% of net sales which was consistent with the same quarter a year ago and average women’s price points decreased about 0.5% from $43.75 to $43.50. For the quarter women’s products saw some nice increases in key categories. Denim performance improved largely driven by increased inclusivity with our t selection, our breadth of brands and looks and the reduction of markdown inventories. The team has done a nice job of continuing to focus on exclusivity first within our selection, whether that be through our private-label brands or development with outside brand partners, which continues to drive traffic to our stores, as well as dot-com. Sweaters once again drove the largest gains in our r tops assortment, while our knit selection remains strong with continued guest preferences around moderate price points simply stated fashion, supersoft fabrics, and easy to wear, easy-to-pair silhouettes.For accessories, our varying selection belts, fragrance, hats, hair and specialty bracelets drove unit sales as well as dollars in the department. And for footwear, our casual assortment, alongside our functional and fashion business was well received throughout the quarter.I continue to be proud of our team’s management of inventory, especially to come off of this more promotional time period for retail with a reduction in markdown inventory. In addition, we continue to prove – improve our sell-throughs in key categories while working with cleaner inventory levels. With the start of our fresh year and season, the response to the women’s management products has been well received by our stores and guests.We look forward to a New Year and the opportunity in stores and online for our women’s business. The market continues to evolve which is encouraging and we have a very talented and passionate team working hard to deliver the best for our Buckle guests.And with that, I will turn it over to Bob Carlberg, Senior Vice President of Men's Merchandising to discuss the performance of our men’s merchandize categories.
Bob Carlberg: Thanks, Kelli. The men’s merchandize sales for the fiscal quarter were at 3% in comparison to the prior year fiscal quarter. Average denim price points decreased from $83.20 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to $82.80 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. For the quarter, our men’s business was approximately 56.5% of net sales which was consistent with the same quarter a year ago and average men’s price points decreased approximately 1.5% from 52.45 to 51.60.I am proud of the way our team has continued to design, develop and deliver high quality and unique merchandize. The fourth quarter marked a ninth consecutive quarter of expansion in our men’s business. Categories of particular strength were casuals, outerwear, accessories, footwear and youth. Denim and button fronts were flat with sweaters having a slight but planned decrease. We did very little discounting during the quarter resulting in a continued strong margins, inventory is in good shape and at some cases slightly better than planned. We are happy with the amount of markdown needed to clear fall and holiday goods in January and February, which will allow us to keep fresh as we head into fall 2020.Initial spring deliveries towards the end of December and January had an encouraging start and good comments from our sales team and guests. Now turning to results on a combined basis. Accessory sales for the fiscal quarter were up approximately 6.5% against the prior year of fiscal quarter and footwear sales were up about 28.5%. These two categories accounted for approximately 9.5% and 8.5% respectively of fourth quarter net sales. This compares to 9% and 7% for each in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Average accessory price points were down approximately 4% and average footwear price points were down about 10%. Again on a combined basis for the quarter denim accounted for 44% of sales and tops accounted for approximately 31.5%. This compares to 45% and 32% for each in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.Our private-label business continued to grow and represented approximately 43.5% of sales for the quarter and 39% for the year. Excuse me. I also want to mention combined basis for the quarter, denim accounted for approximately 44% - oh we did that. I apologize and with that, we welcome the questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first we have Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Tiffany Kanaga: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Given your sourcing exposure to China, can you talk to what you are currently seeing at your manufacturing partners over there? And what kind of delays or impacts from a supply chain perspective you might expect as we move through the year?
Dennis Nelson: Well, presently, we are seeing, maybe, one to four weeks delay depending on the product from China both the men’s and the ladies, probably predominantly in the denim categories. And in the gal’s tops we are seeing similar delays as well. But our partners at last year working with us through the tariff situation, I think are doing a good job in addressing the needs the best everybody can to temper the impact of the Coronavirus.
Tiffany Kanaga: As a follow-up question, you see number of other retailers discuss slowing in-store trends in recent days. Can you give any color around what you are seeing with respect to mall traffic, as well as your online trends as consumers are beginning to change their behaviors due to the Coronavirus? And additionally, can you talk to any measures you might be taking in preparation for any sustained slowdown at the mall?
Dennis Nelson: No, we don’t comment on the future or give out updates on that. We just do the sales reports monthly. But we are continually working with our partners and stay in touch with the deliveries and working on product and staying in close contact for planning for the future if need to be any changes.
Tiffany Kanaga: Thank you very much.
Dennis Nelson: Yes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Steve Marotta with CL King Associates. Please go ahead.
Steven Marotta: Good morning, everybody. Can you remind us what your aggregate exposure to China is as a percent of COGS, say in the last fiscal year or even on a runrate basis if that’s preferable?
Dennis Nelson: I don’t know, if I have a set percent or on the ladies side, I would say, a lot our brands and vendors are continuing to explore other sourcing outside of China. We are still pretty dependent on gal’s denim out of China as we tried some of the other countries and have not been able to achieve the quality and fit that we need in the ladies merchandize. And Bob, do you want to comment on the men’s sourcing?
Bob Carlberg: Sure. We did start to diversify sourcing about five or six years ago. We do have denim being made in three other countries and in those cases, deliveries are on time and in some cases they were to deliver early which helps us mitigate the China challenge. One other thing that we do on the sourcing is we ask it to be ship ready before CNY. That's been in the past to take care of the lack of delivery from CNY, but it helped in this year because when the production workers were the main reason that that they didn't come back, but the office workers to pack and ship. So that mitigated the delivery challenges that other people had.
Steven Marotta: And can you also update us on where you stand digitally? What are the most or recently completed initiatives and what you are expect to complete this year?
Dennis Nelson: Well, in the fourth quarter, we started doing ship from store and that had a nice impact on our e-com business. And we are continually working on that as well and with our e-com IT team and our marketing director, or now have several initiatives to improve our e-com site and our social and so we are looking forward to seeing that happen here in the next few months.
Steven Marotta: Helpful. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Yes, sir.
Operator: And we do have a follow-up from Tiffany Kanaga. Please go ahead.
Tiffany Kanaga: Thanks for taking my next question. With oil having taken a sharp pronounce and considering your geographic footprint, would you remind us what trends you’ve historically seen with respect to y our sales or traffic when oil has moved dramatically?
Dennis Nelson: I am not sure I can recall that for a back, but it seems like the – there is some effect in certain markets. But I think less so now than maybe several years ago, when it was very dependent on the oil business and it seems like the Houston market and different ones have diversified. So I think it would have a little bit of a less effect in the majority of those oil markets than it used to be.
Tiffany Kanaga: Thanks.
Operator: To the presenters, there are no further questions in queue.
Dennis Nelson: If there are no further questions, we can wrap up the call and we thank everybody for their participation, and wish everyone a wonderful rest of the day and a great weekend. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
