Kelli Molczyk: Thanks, Tom. I would like to start by highlighting the performance of our women's merchandise categories for the quarter. Women's merchandise sales for the fiscal quarter were up approximately 3% against the prior year fiscal quarter. Average denim price points decreased from $74.90 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $73.35 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. For the quarter, our women's business was approximately 48.5% of net sales compared to 49.5% last year and average women's price points decreased about 2.5% from $42.75 to $41.70.During the quarter, we achieved positive results across several of our key categories. For denim, the introduction of new fit Darker finishes and the extension of a broader assortment of bottom openings gained momentum. Overall, our expanded offerings in fits, bottom openings, rises in dams and waist sizes across all brands resonated well with our guests.We saw growth in our private-label denim assortment in addition to continued growth in our only at Buckle exclusively built outside brand. While price point denims under $80 continued to make up a large percentage of our overall denim business, we did narrow the gap on our average denim price points from Q2.To tie into our denim performance, we partnered with the American Cancer Society as the official sponsor of Denim Days for the month of October or we donated $1 for every pair of denim sold from participating brands. Approximately $400,000 will be donated to the ACS to support their research and programming efforts.For women's tops, guest preferences were centered around soft hand fabric, warm fall [indiscernible] and simplified styling. Our fashion sweaters and cardigans within our private label brands as well as many other outside brands continue to be well received. For women's footwear, our expansion into more EVA casual looks and branded functional boots aided in our growth at the category. We did see these two categories replaced some of our early short fashion boot sale.Our accessories, several different categories continue to perform well by diversifying our selection and look. And in some areas, streamlining our buys to segmented specific markets. Overall, we were pleased with how we manage inventory through the quarter, reducing mark downs and improving overall margins. Across all women's categories, we sustained improvement in our overall sell-through throughout the quarter on off inventory. With where our inventory is positioned, we feel we are in more nimble as women's fashion continue to change and evolve.And with that, I will turn it over to Bob Carlberg, Senior Vice President of Men's merchandising to discuss the performance of our men's merchandised category.
Bob Carlberg: Kelli. Merchandised sales in the fiscal quarter were up 6% in comparison to the prior year fiscal quarter. Average denim price points increased from $82.90 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $82.95 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. For the quarter, our men's business was approximately 51.5% of net sales compared to 50.5% last year and average men's price points decreased approximately 1.5% from $50.40 to $49.65.We are pleased that the third quarter marked our eighth consecutive quarter of growth for men's product. All categories, except outerwear were up. The outerwear decline was slight and planned as we flow sweaters and outerwear a bit later this year. We believe we found the right flows the way our guest is buying these categories and we continue in that route going forward.Footwear continues to be our strongest growth category with particular strength in Hey Dude, fueled by a large portion of exclusive styles along with our great selection of boots. Results for our two test used stores were positive and we plan on keeping them open both year round. Overall, our fall assortment was well received by both our teammates and our guests, continue to be proud that the teams ability to continually develop exclusive product and keeps our styles unique in the marketplace. This allows us to maintain a strong regular price business even with the downward pressure most everywhere else.Now turning to results on a combined basis. Accessory sales for the fiscal quarter were up approximately 7% against the prior year fiscal quarter. Footwear sales were up about 24.5%. These two categories accounted for approximately 8.5% and 8%, respectively of third quarter net sales. This compares to 8% and 7% for each in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Average accessory price points were down approximately 7% and average footwear price points were down about 8.5%. Again, on a combined basis for the quarter, denim accounted for approximately 42.5% of sales and tops accounted for approximately 34%. This compares to 43% and 34.5% for each in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Our private label business continues to grow and represented just over 40% of sales for the quarter.And with that, we welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Tiffany Kanaga: Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. Would you dig into the gross margin performance this quarter to break down the key drivers behind the merchandise margin improvement despite average price points still coming down. For example, how did mix play a role in the margin increase? Additionally, with your leverage in gross margin a bit better than we might have expected. Can you comment on how your leverage point have evolved? And if you think further improvements could be ahead? Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Good morning, Tiffany. Thank you. I believe our margin improvement was just by the management of our inventory and reduced markdowns, especially in the ladies area. And men's held up very nicely. So we were pleased with the inventory management and the sell-through at regular price and the response from our team and guests on the product. On the leverage, our sales management team took a different approach to managing payrolls in the stores and that was effective to reduce some of our sales payroll expense in the stores. So that was a benefit there on the leverage.
Tom Heacock: And Tiffany on the gross margin side, historically that was closer to mid single-digit and that’s a much lower number today. We brought rent down in certain markets and worked really hard there. So it's probably closer to 1% or just under to get leverage on the gross margin side.
Tiffany Kanaga: Okay. And a follow-up question, with your inventory down 4.5% versus sales up over 4%. Would you elaborate on how you feel on that front headed into the holiday season? Is levels and the quality of the inventory is where you like it? And also, if you’re approaching the holiday including Black Friday, any differently overall than usual, given the shorter window between Thanksgiving and Christmas?
Dennis Nelson: We are in good shape on our inventory. Markdowns are reduced and a lot of the product is new arrivals, so we’re excited to present that to our guest and we’ve no different -- I mean our approach to the holiday season is consistent with the years previous.
Tiffany Kanaga: Right. Thank you very much.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
Operator: And next we will go to Steve Marotta with CL King & Associates. Please go ahead.
Steve Marotta: Good morning, everybody. Can you please review women's average denim price reduction in the third quarter? I missed that. I was writing as fast as I can, but I missed that.
Dennis Nelson: Yes, Steve. We will have Kelli respond to that.
Kelli Molczyk: Sorry about that. It was actually -- the price decrease from 42.75 to 41.
Dennis Nelson: I think he [indiscernible] the denim.
Kelli Molczyk: Oh that. Denim price point, sorry. $74.9 in the third quarter of last year to $73.35. Is that what you’re wanting?
Steve Marotta: Yes. And I know that average denim prices have been a significant headwind to previous comp, that seems to be abating so much -- somewhat. Is there anything on the horizon you could talk about in differentials or denim on a year-over-year basis and where price points -- where you think those prices are headed and why?
Dennis Nelson: Steve, this is Dennis. I think the price points will probably be consistent with the third quarter. We still sell some higher price point denim, but not at the same volume as before but we have got a nice inventory of denim and expect those price points to be pretty consistent with the last quarter.
Steve Marotta: And can you remind us where you are in omni-channel endeavors?
Dennis Nelson: Well, we are consistently working on opportunities there. We've just started to test in certain amount of stores shipped from store to the guest, which has been beneficial and this -- early this fall we brought on a new senior director of marketing which we think will be beneficial as well as improving on our CRM uses that we updated earlier in the year. So we think we have several smaller projects that we think will be good for us.
Steve Marotta: And lastly, can you comment a little bit about traffic trends in the third quarter and how much stabilization you saw there and obviously did you expect that you can talk about your ideas on future traffic trends without specifically commenting from a guidance standpoint obviously?
Dennis Nelson: Yes. So, I think we have done a good job in our stores of studying this up as a destination location for finding our favorite denims and outfits and such. And so I don't know, in the past quarter if the traffic was much different, but I think our teams are doing a good job. We’ve added a lead list to -- what the teams can contact the guests on product to invite them in on their favorite merchandise. So we benefited from that. So it's just working with the teams on that and also we’ve always felt that the best advertisement in our -- for our stores is a word of mouth from our loyal guests and that's working well.
Steve Marotta: Helpful. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And next with David Berman with Berman Capital. Please go ahead.
David Berman: Hi, guys.
Dennis Nelson: Good morning, David.
David Berman: It's good to see you back. It's interesting, looking at your sales to inventory ratios and your turns, you’ve always had good turns. This is the first quarter in about eight or nine where your inventory -- sales have grown faster than inventories and that's really good.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
David Berman: Have you -- what did you -- how have you -- you must have been disappointed obviously because I know you always focused on inventories in the past. What sort of change? Was it more just the top line?
Dennis Nelson: Well, I think the top line, I think we continue to invest in our teams, our store leaders who are promoted from within. And I think they continually are doing a great job in building guest. But I think the -- I think our store product -- the stores are excited about the new merchandise, the denim, we’ve added curvy fits and the gal's denim and expanded the styles and in-house brands. Then the men's continues as Bob mentioned eight quarters of gains in the men's product and we have a very good men's business where a lot of people kind of given up on that. So just a combination of a good things. The teams in -- merchandise teams and the store teams are working hard to improve and it just came together this last quarter.
David Berman: So do you think that you will continue to keep the inventories like low? I mean, are you -- is that like a goal now to try and keep that focus?
Dennis Nelson: Well, I don’t think any of our goals have changed. Sometimes there's more opportunities for going after some product and such. But we’ve always worked hard to keep our inventories in line and I think part of that before was those much higher denim prices we used to do with the sales there, kind of made a difference. So I think we’re just kind of catching up with how many years we’ve had to go against a high denim prices.
David Berman: Right. Okay. Well, good. Let's see more of this. Congratulations. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Nice to hear from you again.
David Berman: Thank you, Dennis.
Dennis Nelson: Yes.
Operator: And next we have a question from Richard Dearnley with Longport Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Dearnley: Good morning. I’m relatively new to your company. The online store increase is relatively modest. And if the initiative is new, it would seem like the base would be new, so the gains would be somewhat more dramatic than 5%. But I don't understand the base, so …
Dennis Nelson: Yes. So we had substantial growth for many years and such. And then it leveled out and we had a solid gain this quarter, and I believe e-comm was 12% of our company sales this quarter, which I believe is a high for us. And we continue to work at that also, we probably had less promotional goods online so that might have factored a little bit in the gain.
Richard Dearnley: Okay. And then looking at the last 10 years or so, it looks as though corporate policy is to about payout the net income for the year in dividend. So is that a policy or does that just happened?
Dennis Nelson: Well, each year -- usually in the past it's been December, the Board reviews its thoughts on the dividends. And I don't think we look at any past history in making those decisions.
Richard Dearnley: Okay. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Yes.
Operator: And to the presenters on the call, we have no further questions in queue.
Dennis Nelson: If there's no additional questions, we can wrap up the call today. We thank everybody for joining us and their participation, and wish everybody a wonderful holiday week next week.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
