Karen Rhoads: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call this morning. On November 18, 2016, press release we reported that net income for the 13-week third quarter that ended October 29, 2016, was $23.4 million, or $0.48 per share on a diluted basis. And that is compared to net income of $35.9 million or $0.74 per share on a diluted basis for the prior year 13-week quarter that ended October 31, 2015. Year-to-date our net income for the 39-week period ended October 29, 2016, was $62 million or $1.28 per share on a diluted basis and that is compared to net income of $92.9 million or $1.93 per share on a diluted basis for the prior year 39-week period that ended October 31, 2015. Net sales for the 13-week third quarter decreased 14.6% to $239.2 million compared to net sales of $280.2 million for the prior year 13-week third quarter. Comparable store sales for the quarter were down 15.3% in comparison to the same 13-week period in the prior year, and online sales decreased 8.5% to $23.7 million. Year-to-date net sales decreased 11.8% to $694.9 million for the 39-week fiscal period ended, October 29, 2016, compared to net sales of $787.6 million for the prior year 39-week period ended, October 31, 2015. Comparable store sales for the year-to-date period were down 12.5% in comparison to the same 39-week period in the prior year and online sales decreased 3.7% to $67.6 million. As noted in this morning's press release, net sales for the 13-week and 39- week fiscal period ended October 29, 2016, are reported net of the impact of both the reward redemption and accrual for estimated future rewards related to the company's new guest loyalty program which launched during the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2016. Absent the impact of the new loyalty program, total net sales for the third quarter were down 13.2% and comparable store sales were down 13.9%. For the year-to-date period, total net sales were down 10.4% and comparable store sales were down 11.1%. Gross margins for the quarter was 40.5% down approximately 140 basis points from 41.9% for the third quarter last year. The decrease was driven primarily by deleveraged occupancy buying and distribution expenses resulting from the comparable store sales decline, which had about a 270 basis point impact and was partially offset by 130 basis point improvement in merchandise margin. Factoring out the impact of the new loyalty program margins, merchandise margins for the quarter would have been approximately 30 basis points. For the year-to-date period, gross margin was 39.1% down approximately 220 basis points from 41.3% for the same period last year, with the decrease being driven by deleveraged occupancy buying and distribution expenses resulting from the comparable store sales decline. Merchandise margins for the year-to-date period were essentially flat. Without the impact of the new loyalty program year-to-date merchandise margins would have been down approximately 40 basis points. Selling expense for the quarter was 21.2% of net sales compared to 18.7% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, with increases as a percentage of net sales in store payroll, marketing, health insurance, and certain other selling expenses, partially offset by a reduction in expense related to the incentive bonus accrual. For the year-to-date period, selling expense was 20.8% of net sales compared to 18.7% of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2015, with increases as a percentage of net sales in-store payroll, marketing, health insurance, and certain other selling expenses, partially offset by a reduction in expense related to the incentive bonus accrual. General and administrative expenses for the quarter were 3.9% of net sales compared to 3.1% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, with increases as a percentage of net sales in equity compensation and several other general and administrative expense categories, partially offset by a reduction in expense related again to the incentive bonus accrual. For the year-to-date period, general and administrative expenses were 4.3% of net sales compared to 4.0% of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2015, with increases as a percentage of net sales across several general and administrative expense categories, partially offset by a reduction in expense related to the incentive bonus accrual. Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.4% compared to 20.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. For the year-to-date period, our operating margin was 14.0% compared to 18.6% for the same period last year. Other income for the quarter was $497,000 compared to $951,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and other income for the year-to-date period was $1.5 million compared to $2.0 million last year. Income tax expense, as a percentage of pre-tax net income, was 37.3% for the third quarter of both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 bringing third quarter net income to $23.4 million for fiscal 2016 versus $35.9 million for fiscal 2015. Year-to-date, income tax expense was also 37.3% for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 bringing year-to-date net income to $62.0 million for fiscal 2016 versus $92.9 million for fiscal 2015. Our press release also included a balance sheet, as of October 29, 2016, which included the following: Inventory of $148.2 million, which was down approximately 16% from inventory of $175.9 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015; and total cash and investments of $232.8 million, which compares to $231.5 million at the end of fiscal 2015, and compares to $192 million at the same time a year ago. As of the end of the quarter, inventory on a comparable store basis was down approximately 18%, and total markdown inventory was up compared to the same time a year ago. We ended the quarter with $175 million in fixed assets, net of accumulated depreciation. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $10 million, and depreciation expense was $7.9 million. For the year-to-date period, capital expenditures were $27 million and depreciation expense was $24.1 million. Year-to-date, our capital spending is broken down as follows: $25.8 million for new store construction, store remodels, and store technology upgrades; and $1.2 million for capital spending at the corporate headquarters and distribution center. We still expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $28 million to $32 million, which includes primarily new store and store remodeling projects and certain IT investments. For the quarter, UPTs increased approximately 1.5%. The average unit retail decreased approximately 5.5% and the average transaction value decreased 4.0%. For the year-to-date period, UPTs increased approximately 1.0%. The average unit retail decreased approximately 3.0% and the average transaction value decreased 2.5%. Buckle ended the quarter with 470 retail stores in 44 states compared to 468 stores in 44 states at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Additionally, our total square footage was 2.403 million square feet as of the end of the quarter compared to 2.372 million square feet at the same time a year ago. And now at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Heacock, our Vice President of Finance, Treasurer, and Corporate Controller.
Tom Heacock: Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'd like to start by highlighting the performance from our various merchandise categories for the quarter. Men's merchandise sales for the quarter were down approximately 9%. Our average denim price points decreased from $92.70 in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to $89.15 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. For the quarter, our men's business was approximately 46% of net sales compared to 43% last year, and our average men's price points decreased approximately 3.5% from $57 to $55. Women's merchandise sales for the quarter were down approximately 18.5%. Our average denim price points decreased from $95.50 in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to $87.20 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. For the quarter, our women's business was approximately 54% of net sales compared to 57% last year, and our average women's price points decreased approximately 9% from $52 to $47.35. For the quarter, combined accessory sales were down approximately 16.5% and combined footwear sales were down approximately 19.5%. These two categories accounted for approximately 8.5% and 6% respectively of third quarter net sales, which compares to 8.5% and 6.5% for each in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Our average accessory price points were down approximately 1.5% and average footwear price points were down approximately 17% for the quarter. For the quarter, denim accounted for approximately 45% of sales and tops accounted for approximately 32%, which compares to 45.5% and 31.5% for each in the third quarter of last year. Our private label business was up slightly as a percentage of sales and represent approximately 35% of sales for the quarter. During the quarter, we opened one new store, completed five full remodels, and closed one store. As of the end of the quarter, 392 of our 470 stores were in our newest format. For the full year fiscal 2016, we still anticipate opening a total of five new stores which includes one store that opened last week. We also still anticipate completing 19 full remodels which include two that moved back into the remodel space in November. And with that, we welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And first question will come from Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Tiffany Kanaga: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Could you talk about what actions you took to achieve the inventory reductions for the quarter and how you feel that levels heading into holiday?
Dennis Nelson: Thank you, Tiffany. Our inventory is down as we mentioned but a year ago at the end of the quarter, it was up 19% so dollars are fairly comparable to two years ago. And I think just our team -- our merchandisers have done a very good job of planning and building product appropriate for this season. We reduced sweaters in the girls category especially and some in the men's, outerwear was brought down. In the footwear in the girl's side, last year we had a great selection of tall leather boots and the Cowboy boot was still working at that time. So we had boots in a 300 give-or-take price range, where this year that becomes a very small part of our business and we're selling more of the short boots and other footwear that are $70 or under. So those are a few the major ones. We've also especially in the girls side made a wider range of styles and brands and details, we're selling fewer of the more detailed higher-priced denim and we've added several brands and styles in the $70 range. And so we have a lot of different lifestyles, looks, lot of cleaner looks, some color denim, but the price points are down from there. So we've been very happy how the team has handled a difficult retail environment.
Tiffany Kanaga: Thanks. And if could ask one more. Would you talk about the growth in general and administrative dollars in the quarter and looking ahead do you still see opportunity to drive total SG&A reductions beyond sales to leverage and in what areas?
Dennis Nelson: Well, we continue to review that and we feel like we've always been very good at not having excessive cost in our system. We continue to review that as we go forward as, as far as store performance out there and a variety of things in the office where we've improved efficiencies in some of our shipments of freight and kind of a little bit throughout the company but you guys have anything else there on that.
Tom Heacock: Looking at the third quarter, the bulk of the increase in the G&A to your question was in equity compensation expense and that's really a function of how many shares granted for this year that we expect the best and so there is a little bit of change there and that's the biggest part of the increase year-over-year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please go ahead.
Julie Kim: Good morning. This is Julie Kim on for Simeon. Thank you for taking our question. Can you just give more color on the current sales trends and what drove the meaningful decline in online sales in particular? And what we should expect moving forward I believe, last quarter you mentioned moving towards different online platforms. Are there any updates there or any lasting impacts from that still going on? Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you. Regards to the online sale the last two years in the third quarter we had some very strong growth. And I think with our overall sales being down and our price points being down substantially that that's had the biggest effect on our Internet store. And I think in the e-com, there is always a few things, we can do and we continue to make some upgrades there. But I think that's -- that's kind of what's caused that and I'm sorry, I didn't write down the first part of your question?
Julie Kim: Oh, just this, if you could give some more color on current sales trends you're seeing?
Dennis Nelson: No really, no forecast going forward. I think the third quarter as we mentioned was some slowing traffic in the mall and the price points being down and just being smart about inventory with what's going on, I think that's had the effect on our sales.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. And next in queue, Jessica Schmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jessica Schmidt: Hi thanks for taking my questions. I guess can you just talk about any kind of insight into how the new product is resonating with the customer. Are you starting to see any of your last customers come back to the store and just given the continued comp declines, how should we be thinking about your store footprint, you think we could start to see any store closures?
Dennis Nelson: As far as store closures go, we review that yearly and sometimes we have a couple and sometimes we don't. And but that will continue and I would expect at least a couple at the end of the year. But yes, our guests we are getting some positive feedback from our guest in our stores on our product selection and the newness. We continue to flow the new product and getting some nice sale through on the majority of the new deliveries.
Jessica Schmidt: And just as a quick follow-up, how are you thinking about your promotional positioning into 4Q it sounds like you have higher markdown inventory to clear too. But do you think that you will do any kind of special buys for the holiday season may be similar to what you did in July?
Dennis Nelson: It's too late in the season to buy, have special buys for this particular one. I would say our cadence is pretty much consistent with what we've done in the past. We don't put this whole store on sales; it's just the items that need a little juice.
Jessica Schmidt: Great, I'll pass it on.
Dennis Nelson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Next is Ujjval Dave with Ujjval Investments. Please go ahead.
Ujjval Dave: Hi this is Ujjval, thanks for taking my call. Last time, I got on the call was in November 2015 when company's comps were falling at 6% to 8% monthly rate. At that time, I didn't hear any promising strategy on how you will turn around the ship. I'm making another attempt to find out more. During last 12 months, the monthly comps fall has accelerated pact at around 15%. For you guys this isn’t a new phenomenon and comps have been falling since December 2013 which is nearly three years! I understand that retail industry, especially apparel industry is going through some tough phase, however here the problem seems to be specific to Buckle. Your competitors’ comp drop has gone into low-single-digits or it has become positive now. Now to your credit, Buckle has quite appealing and high quality merchandise, and despite comps drop, you guys are not compromising on the quality, which is healthy. However if customers won't come to the store, there won't be impulsive purchase. As far as online purchase is concerned, you guys have minimum $7 shipping charges, no matter what is the order size. That is discouraging and as we could see the online sales has been dropping as well now. So my question is what exactly is your solid plan to inspire more in-store visits so that comp sales could start turning positive going forward. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: While we're going to continue to keep our focus on being a specialty store and as we've mentioned, the sales have dropped with the price points coming down. And we continue to evolve every year sometimes; we like the last several years we were able to maximize the trend of high price point Denim with strong details, great finishes and as that as guest is evolved to different styling in the Denim and the selection, we've evolved as well as so we don't have the benefit of the $150 jean plus with more of being under $100. As we mentioned, we shop and try to put a great selection together for our guests on what they want and where we see the new trends going. And like, the last year or two, the boots have been very strong in the higher price points, that wasn't going to happen again. So we have different opportunities in the marketplace depending on what trends are going and right now, the price points have come down and we've offered different variety, new looks, new brands, and as our guest evolve and see how we've changed and all the different looks and lifestyle they can get it to our store then I think they're going to be very happy. And part of our message is to get that message out, how we continue to evolve. We continue to have a very strong sales team and store managers which is very important in our business. And also we just started a Buckle App where our guests once they sign in for that can see daily new product that's arriving in their stores that they visit to create that interest and keeping them in tune to what we have going on and we're continuing to work on other ideas to increasing the excitement to get to the stores.
Ujjval Dave: And that's something good to know. If I can squeeze in another question – you guys have quite significant insider ownership including among the Founder and the management. I'm sure along with the other investors, you all are hurting when share prices has dropped so much in last two years. However, I don't see enough urgency to fix the problem. I appreciate the fact that you guys don't engage into ready, engage in profit less growth by having heavy discounting storewide. But if you look at last year I asked if there is any plans such that customer could order the item online and pickup in the store? I have been told that in Spring 2016, you guys might consider implementing that but I don't think that has happened yet. So could you please provide some colors on what was the rationale behind the decision of not implementing at all. Why don’t you create environment, so that customer can come to the store to pick up item and make impulsive purchase of other stuff as well. Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Yes, well we also as part of our app, people can reserve the product; they see and come into the store to pick it up there. And so we worked on that and we're continuing to work on some software and our new POS that we will be working on over the next year, year-and-a-half to be able to do more things that would be friendly for the guest that way.
Ujjval Dave: But am I correctly hearing that as a customer I will be able to make the payment online then pick it from the store without any additional shipping cost?
Dennis Nelson: Yes, no additional cost by reserving the product on the app and coming into the store.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. Next is Kyle Kavanaugh with Palisade Capital. Please go ahead.
Kyle Kavanaugh: Yes, hi good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on that question. Do you guys feel that the price decline on any price point is kind of like extremely difficult to overcome or do you feel that if the merchandising are different, you could have better comps at this point or basically do you feel like your merchandising efforts into the shares have been as good as they can to operate in the current environment?
Dennis Nelson: Well, Kyle, I supposed it is always room for improvement at some point but I think our merchandisers are doing a very nice job on the selection and the quality and the price points of what we're offering. And we're always looking to, I mean we're always looking for new vendors, we're looking to develop new product and but it's got to make sense for quality and price and sometimes are just a few more opportunities with the high fashion than the other times. So I'm still very confident that we have merchandise teams are doing a great job and understand our customer and we'll put out a nice presentation.
Kyle Kavanaugh: And so in the face of declining mall traffic and heavy declines in average price point, are there some other things that you can do to try to overcome that at least get that comp comparison going in the right direction from this point, 15% declines in comps is a pretty large number.
Dennis Nelson: I agree but we're hopeful that the economy is such that it will improved that will be I think which is part of the problem in mall traffic. But also we have -- we're working on developing more stylists in our store to be able to put outfits and deliver packages to our guests that are too busy to get to the mall, as well as we continue to work with our stores on setting up get fitted or appointments in the stores so they come in and have kind of a special arrangement with the guests for putting outfits together and their own dressing room such to try on and make it a special experience.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We've a follow-up from Ujjval Dave. Please go ahead.
Ujjval Dave: Hi, this one is my last question. Corporate finance clearly suggests that if management and board believes that if the share is very cheap it should be repurchased using the free cash flow. In the case of Buckle if we exclude cash and investment, market cap is barely $800 million. And if I look at last 12 months net income of nearly $130 million, the share is trading at six to seven times earnings multiple, which seems quite cheap. Now that should give enough reasons to the board to use free cash flow to buy back the shares. I had seen that you guys mostly use the money towards giving special dividend and regular dividend, but buyback is insignificant. And share has dropped nearly 60%, if we don't consider special dividend payments in the last 12 months to two years. So Dennis, since you're on the board, could you please give us some color on how the board is thinking on when to consider buyback versus special dividend payment? Thank you.
Dennis Nelson: Well the only comment we have right now is we try to be careful on that because we don't have a large float and we want to make sure that we don't make it too slim afloat for our stock and so that's part of the reason, we are cautious on the buybacks.
Ujjval Dave: Okay.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. And there are no additional questions at this time, please continue.
