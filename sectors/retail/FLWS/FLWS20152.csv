"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM Fiscal 2015 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Joe Pititto, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

I'll now turn the call over to Jim McCann.
Jim McCann: Thank you. As you all saw in our release this morning, we had a good fiscal second quarter, frankly, better than good. To provide you with some context, we started the quarter by closing on the largest acquisition in the history of our company adding the iconic Harry & David brand to our business, which takes our annual revenues past the $1 billion mark, and makes us a leading player in the growing Gourmet Food Gift space. We achieved solid revenue growth of nearly 5%, excluding Harry & David with gross -- the growth across all three of our business segments. This was highlighted by nearly 7% growth in our Gourmet Foods and Gift Baskets business, adjusted for the impact of the Thanksgiving Day fire at our Fannie May West and Distribution Center. Speaking of the fire, we were able to overcome these incredible challenges posed by the loss of some $30 million in inventory and the destruction of an important distribution facility, impacts that were felt across virtually all of our brands and businesses. This is an accomplishment for which I am extremely proud of our associates across the enterprise, more on this in a moment. Lastly, during the quarter, we expanded the reach of our omni-channel, multi-brand customer strategy with the rollout of our multi-brand website. Based on our early read of our customer metrics and behaviors, we are very excited by the opportunity we see to deepen the relationships we have with our customers and increase our share of their celebratory and gifting wallet. In terms of our results for the quarter, we’ve more than doubled our revenues and tripled our bottom line year-over-year. This reflects the contribution from Harry & David, which performed as we expected. Importantly, with the holiday season behind us, we have now begun our comprehensive integration program, with work streams in place to identify and pursue opportunities for both synergistic revenue growth and operating efficiencies. Clearly, we had a lot going on in this quarter and almost all of it good, excluding of course the fire, but including the incredibly positive response of our team or response that I believe has made our company stronger than ever. The fire in which thankfully no one was injured, destroyed our facility and all of the inventory and equipment stored there for the holiday -- for the key holiday season. As a result, we had extremely limited supplies of our iconic Fannie May and Harry London Chocolates during this key holiday season across all of our sales channels. As you can imagine, the timing of the fire on Thanksgiving Day was especially challenging, particularly since Fannie May’s business trends leading up the Thanksgiving have been very strong. Fortunately, our insurance policies cover us for raw material losses and business interruption. Most important was how Fannie May and our entire company responded to the challenge. As I mentioned earlier, I am particularly proud of the tremendous response and positive spirit of our dedicated associates throughout the company who work around the clock on Thanksgiving Day and throughout the remainder of the quarter, developing and implementing contingency plans to accelerate production and identify alternative warehouse and distribution options, so that we could minimize the impact of the fire on our business and continue to help our customers delivery smiles during the holiday season. Chris will provide some additional color on the Fannie May strong initiatives in his remarks in a just few minutes. Lastly, before I turn the call over to Bill for his review of the financial and operating metrics for the quarter, I would like to point out the performance of our 1-800-FLOWERS.COM Consumer Floral brand, which showed continued top and bottomline growth during the second quarter. The 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brand grew revenues nearly 3% during the quarter and maintained solid gross margins, despite an extremely promotional competitive environment. As a result, bottomline contribution in the Consumer Floral segment increased approximately 10% for the period. These results build on the positive trends that we saw in our first quarter and illustrate the strength of the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brand as a leader in the floral gifting space. Based on the positive trends we have seen across all of the businesses through the first half of our fiscal year, we are very comfortable with our guidance for fiscal 2015 and we are increasingly excited by the opportunities we see ahead for us to build our position as a leading omni-channel gift provider for our customers. Bill, would you run through the metrics for the quarter.
Bill Shea: Thank you, Jim. As you’ve just heard, we had a very eventful and good fiscal second quarter. Beginning with the close of the Harry & David transaction at the start of the quarter, our largest acquisition to-date and one that makes the already important holiday season even more so. Followed by the fire on Thanksgiving Day that destroyed our Fannie May warehouse and distribution center, including the inventory that had been held for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the upcoming holiday period, and Valentine’s Day, thereby posing some unique and significant challenges across the enterprise and culminating with the solid top and bottomline results for the quarter that we announced this morning. As Jim mentioned, Harry & David performed as we expected during the holiday period and we are particularly proud of how all our associates across the enterprise, really many of our new team members at Harry & David rose to the occasion to address the challenges posed by the Fannie May fire, and as a result, helped us deliver the solid results you saw in this morning release. In our release, we provided our top and bottomline results, both as reported and on an as-adjusted basis, with accompanying tables at the back of the release to explain the various adjustments. We believe the adjusted results provide a more comparable view of our business performance in the second quarter by adding back one-time costs associated with the Harry & David acquisition as well as adjusting for the impacts and related insurance coverage associated with the Fannie May fire. In terms of the adjustments related to the Harry & David acquisition, we incurred $3.8 million of transaction and related costs associated with the acquisition, primarily related to legal, accounting, and other third party services. In addition, we recorded several purchase accounting adjustments in accordance with GAAP accounting rules that resulted in $1.6 million reduction in the value of deferred revenues and $4.8 million increase in the value of inventory as of the acquisition date. The combined impact of these purchase accounting adjustments was to reduce reported second quarter revenues by $1.6 million and reduced gross margins and EBITDA by $6.4 million. Regarding adjustments for the impact associated with the Fannie May warehouse fire, the fire destroyed approximately $30 million of assets, mainly inventory. In addition to being a warehouse, the facility also served as the primary distribution center for the Fannie May and Harry London chocolates for the retail, e-commerce, and wholesale channels, the distribution centre for our Stock Yards steak business and one of our direct [shipped] [ph] floral gift DCs that we operate around the country. Between the loss inventory and disruption to our distribution capabilities, we estimate the impact on reported revenues during the quarter was $13.8 million, comprised of $13.6 million impact on a Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment and $200,000 hit to BloomNet revenues. The impact of these lost revenues on our gross margin and EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $5.9 million and $5.6 million respectively. Now regarding specific financial results and key metrics from continuing operations for the second quarter. Total net revenues from continuing operations increased 100.6% to $534.3 million, compared with $266.3 million in the prior year period. Including the aforementioned adjustments for the Fannie May warehouse fire and the impact of the purchase accounting related to the Harry & David transaction, total revenues for the quarter increased 106.4% to $549.7 million. During the quarter our e-commerce orders increased 62.7% to $5,302,000 compared with $3,258,000 in the year ago period and average order size during the quarter increased approximately 40% to $77.13 compared to $55.04 in the prior year period. During the quarter we added 1.3 million new customers. This was achieved while concurrently stimulating repeat orders from existing customer who represented 60.4% of total customers during the quarter. These metrics reflect the contributions from Harry & David during the quarter as well as the continued year-over-year growth, excluding Harry & David. Gross margin for the quarter was 45%, up 330 basis points compared with 41.7% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the contributions from Harry & David. Operating expenses as a percent of total revenues, including depreciation and amortization, was 31%, up 10 basis points compared with 30.9% in the prior year period. This reflects the aforementioned impact on the lost revenues associated with the Fannie May warehouse fire and the purchase accounting adjustment on Harry & David revenues. Adjusted for these impacts, operating expenses as a percent of revenues would have improved by 70 basis points to 30.2% compared with the prior year period. As a result of these factors, reported EBITDA, excluding stock-based compensation, increased 144% to $85 million compared with $34.9 million in the prior year period. Reported net income attributable to the company increased 162% to $45.8 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared with $17.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the prior year period. Excluding stock-based compensation expense as well as the impact of the aforementioned Fannie May warehouse fire and the transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments related to Harry & David acquisition, adjusted EBITDA increased 188.5% to $100.7 million compared with EBITDA, excluding stock-based compensation, of $34.9 million in the prior year period. Adjusted net income attributable to the company and adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 218.3% and 207.4% respectively, to $55.7 million or $0.83 per diluted share compared with $17.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to segment results, 1-800-FLOWERS Consumer Floral segment, during the second quarter revenues in this category increased 2.5% to $99.6 million compared with $97.1 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margin for the quarter was 38.7%, essentially flat with 38.8% in the prior year period, and segment contribution margin increased 9.8% to $9.5 million compared with $8.7 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in contribution margin primarily reflects enhanced operating leverage associated with the increased revenues. In our BloomNet segment, revenues increased 1% to $20.1 million compared with $19.9 million in the prior year period. BloomNet revenue growth was impacted by product shortages associated with the aforementioned Fannie May fire warehouse as well as delivery delays related to the continuing dock strikes on the West Coast. Adjusted for these impacts, BloomNet revenues would have increased approximately 3% for the quarter compared to the prior year period. Gross margins for the quarter increased 100 basis points to 55.1% compared with 54.1% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting product and service mix and segment contribution margin increased 2.2% to $6.7 million compared with $6.5 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the strong gross margins and the continued focus on managing operating expenses. In our Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment, revenue increased 177.1% to $414.7 million compared with $149.6 million in the prior year period. This reflects the contribution from the Harry & David brand, which was acquired at the start of the quarter. The category also benefited from strong sales growth at our Cheryl's and 1-800-Baskets brands as well as the continued growth for the DesignPac wholesale gift baskets business. As previously mentioned, the Fannie May warehouse fire impacted revenues in the segment by approximately $13.6 million. Adjusted for this lost sales and excluding Harry & David, revenues in this segment increased 6.9% to $160 million. Gross margin for the quarter increased 430 basis points to 46% compared with 41.7% in the prior year period reflecting the contributions of the Harry & David brand. Segment contribution margin increased 191.4% to $90.5 million compared with $31 million in the prior year period, also reflecting the contributions from the Harry & David brand. Adjusted for the aforementioned impact from the Fannie May fire and the purchase accounting on Harry & David, segment contribution margin increased 30 basis points to $102.4 million. Turning to corporate expense, our segment contribution margin results exclude costs associated with the company’s enterprise shared services platform which includes among other services, IT, human resources, finance, legal, and executive. These functions are operated under a centralized management platform providing support services to the entire organization. For the fiscal second quarter, corporate expenses from continuing operations, including stock-based compensation was $23.1 million compared with $12.5 million in the prior year period, reflecting the addition of the Harry & David overhead expenses in the quarter, as well as the one-time transaction costs. Turning to our balance sheet, at the end of the second quarter, we had $101.2 million in cash and equivalents on our balance sheet. Long-term debt was $139.6 million, reflecting our first quarterly payment on the original $142.5 million term loan associated with our Harry & David acquisition. Additionally, there were no borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Our receivable position of $74.4 million reflects our revenue growth during the quarter, including the incremental receivables associated with Harry & David, as well as the $15 million insurance receivable for our lost inventory related to Fannie May warehouse fire. The majority of these receivables will be converted into cash during the current quarter. Inventory of $70.8 reflects the incremental inventories associated with the Harry & David business, as well as inventories across all of our brands in preparation for the Valentine and spring holiday season, somewhat offset by the inventories lost in the Fannie May warehouse fire. Now regarding guidance, based on our strong results for the first half of our fiscal year, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2015. For the year, we anticipate generating total revenues from continuing operations in excess of $1.1 billion. Regarding bottom-line results, we expect to generate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million excluding stock-based compensation, as well as the aforementioned transaction and purchase accounting adjustments related to the Harry & David acquisition and the adjustments for the impact of the Fannie May warehouse fire. Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share, excluding the aforementioned transaction-related costs and purchase accounting adjustments and adjusting for the impact of the Fannie May warehouse fire. Our full year guidance includes the anticipated losses in our fiscal third and fourth quarters, associated with the seasonality of the Harry & David business. Lastly, as we mentioned in our press release this morning, with Harry & David’s key holiday season now completed, we recently launched the comprehensive integration program designed for identifying and pursue synergistic opportunities for both revenue growth and operating efficiencies. We have number of initiatives underway across our business platform, which we believe can generate operating cost efficiencies in excess of $50 million over the next 36 months. We anticipate that achieving these savings will likely require some investment, which would offset any savings during the current fiscal year. As a result, we expect the full benefit of these operating synergies, which we will realize over a three-year period beginning in fiscal 2016. I will now turn the call to Chris.
Chris McCann: Thanks Bill. Our fiscal second quarter was a challenging but good period for us. In addition then to our top and bottom line results, the acquisition of Harry & David also significantly broadened our great gift offering. With our unique Royal Riviera pears, Signature Gift Towers, Moose Munch treats, Wolferman’s Muffins and much more, Harry & David’s gift offerings fits perfectly with our focus on providing our customers with truly original products at the very best quality, value and selection. Harry & David also has millions of new customers to our already large and growing customer database, further expanding our reach and providing a tremendous opportunity cross brand marketing and merchandising. As we’ve mentioned in past calls, cross-brand marketing and merchandising is the impetus behind our multi-brand customer strategy. During the second quarter, we completed the transition of our gourmet food gift brands onto new multi-brand website, providing customers with the convenience of one sign-on, one shopping cart, one address book and much more, all designed to help them deliver smiles for a broader range of recipients and occasions. Throughout the quarter, we added a variety of features and functions, including our Celebrations Rewards program that enables customers to earn points and use them across all of our brands. And Celebrations Passport, our pay-one price for year-round free shipping program across all of our brands. Both programs are quickly gaining traction with our customers. While the multi-brand website is still in its early stages, we are already seeing positive change in the customer metrics that we expect and that make us so excited about the potential for this platform, including incremental growth in cross-brand purchases with related improvements in repeat rates and average spend. Looking ahead, we will be stepping up our cross-promotion efforts, designed to engage and educate our customers. We will enable Celebrations Rewards to live in our customers’ mobile wallets on the Apple and Android platforms. We will utilize our new consolidated database and CRM tools to expand our marketing efforts from a primarily occasion-based focus to an increased emphasis on recipient and category-based marketing. We will also begin the planning in order to move the Harry & David brands onto the multi-brand website to further expand the celebratory ecosystem that we are building for our customers. Lastly, in terms of challenges faced and overcome, I would like to add that Jim’s comments about how proud we are of our associates across the enterprise for the way they’ve responded and worked as a team to mitigate the impact of the fire at our Maple Heights, Ohio facility. To give you an idea of the scale and challenge that we faced, the fire on Thanksgiving morning heading into one of our biggest shopping weekends of the year destroyed approximately 100 million pieces of chocolate, including more than 100,000 pre-booked customer orders, 100% of our Stockyards’ stake inventory, a variety of hard goods destined to BloomNet customers and eliminated one of our direct shipped floral locations. In addition, with the facility unusable, more than 100 associates who worked there were immediately displaced. Fortunately, the Fannie May management team led by Kevin Coen, quickly rallied key people and resources from across the enterprise. By that following Monday, only three days after the fire, we had ensured that all of the associates from the Maple Heights facility would have a place to work, busing many of them to our Fannie May chocolate factory in Canton, Ohio, with a healthy ramped up production and fulfillment operations for the holiday season. Within days, our facility’s team has secured a new food certified refrigerated warehouse and distribution center, only minutes from the Maple Heights facility. The Fannie May website, which had to stop taking orders over the Thanksgiving weekend was up and running within days and as of today, we have nearly 100% of our original product offerings available on the fanniemay.com website. While our business during the holiday season was clearly impacted by the fire, I’m certain that Fannie May and our entire organization is stronger than ever, having risen to the challenge. I will now turn the call over to Jim.
Jim McCann: I think that’s a fitting description, stronger than ever and better positioned frankly than ever. As we head into the second half of our fiscal year, we see numerous opportunities to deepen our relationships with our customers, as we become the preferred destination for all of their celebratory and gifting needs. Our 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brand continues to grow and extend its leadership in the floral gifting space. Our collection of Gourmet Foods and Gift Baskets brands continue to grow nicely, nearly 7% for the holiday quarter before the addition of Harry & David. And now combined with the iconic Harry & David brands, we are a clear leader in the growing gift segment. And all of these initiatives, fruit bouquets, mobile and social commerce and our omni-channel, multi-brand customer focus, I think you can see that we are pretty excited about the growth opportunities we see in front of us. Now that concludes our formal remarks and I’ll ask Karen to please give instructions on how we can go to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have Dan Kurnos from The Benchmark Company.
Dan Kurnos: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Strong quarter guys. Just a few questions here, Bill, just a quick housekeeping question. You did give some impact from the fire. Obviously, thanks for all the detail so far. On the revenue line, splitting out organic Gourmet Food and Gift Basket revenue, could you also give the contribution to gross dollars and EBITDA, both on a reported and adjusted basis on an organic basis for the GFGB segment ex Harry & David?
Bill Shea: Harry & David or for the impact of the fire. So, the impact on the top line was about $13.8 million. $13.6 million impacted that Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment. About $200,000 was on BloomNet with about bottomline contribution of about $5.6 million, mainly $5.5 million of it in the Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment.
Dan Kurnos: Okay. I’ll take it offline with you anyway. Just wanted to get some more clarity just on the actual dollars contributed by organic GFGB, but that’s fine. Just a couple of high-level questions then look, I mean, Jim, obviously you had really strong demand despite scaling back at promotions. We know that with the absence of inventory at the retail level, you scale back a lot of the promo stuff, and I guess, I wanted to hear from you guys how you think about your game plan going forward. Now that you’ve at least tried to sort of realign consumer behavior, purchasing behavior, especially with regards to Fannie May?
Jim McCann: Sure. On the Fannie May front, I think you are always -- once you get in the gut like we did and you see the recovery and you see the effort of the people, you see how teams come together quickly, you see leadership really emerge. Remember this is the team that we’ve rebuilt over the last couple of years, and going into this event, our trend lines looked very strong. We had double-digit comp store sales increases. We had double-digit e-commerce increases, so things were looking really good. And frankly, the changes that the management at Fannie May were making in the stores had not been realized yet, just the basic things had been but the really programmatic changes were yet to come. So we’re really excited about where they were going. Then we had the fire, and you see how we recovered, how the team responded, how the leadership stepped up, how everyone across the enterprise chipped in to help them was extraordinary to see. So, I think that that leaves us in awfully good position, because as they get their inventory back, but there will still be a lingering hangover in this quarter because a lot of what we’ve -- some of what we’ve lost in the fire in Maple Heights included packaging and inventory that we were readying for Valentine’s Day. They ramped up production and of course as a consequence of that rather than doing that with ingredients that you purchased at favorable terms, we were buying those ingredients at less favorable terms. But Bill has already incorporated that into all the numbers you’ve heard from him. So they responded well. I think they are stronger than ever because some of the lessons they learnt through the holiday really by force took us away from other promotional activities we would have done. If we don’t have the inventory, there is no sense discounting. But what we saw is a really good response from not only our internal associates but from organic community. We also saw tremendous response from our customers. They wanted our brand. They wanted our specific products, and they were willing to wait for it. They were willing to stand in queues, knowing that inventory would be getting to the stores as we made it fresh every day. So what we see is the customers were there, wanted our brands, wanted our specific products. Discounting was eliminated and yet they were still there. So net-net, we feel that as we anniversary that event next year, as we enter the next year’s holiday season, we will be bigger, stronger than ever with a better positioned brand with good wholesale relationships and wholesale relationships that frankly stood by us through this difficult time and appreciated the efforts that our team went through to satisfy their customers. So net-net, I think we have a bigger and better brand. We learnt a lot about our customer and position of our brand. And now, we’ll have more efficient operations as a result of being able to re-engineer everything anew.
Dan Kurnos: So since you brought up the vendors, can you just confirm or give us some color on whether or not there was any forward-strain after the fire going as we look out now from -- on your vendor relationships and if you could just remind us what your thoughts are on long-term replacement plan for the destroyed facility?
Jim McCann: I’m not sure I understood the first part of your question. Hey Bill, did you?
Chris McCann: Yeah. I’ll take that. This is Chris. Yeah, I don’t really see any real strained impact from vendor relations. I think overall we had really strong vendors to begin with. And what Jim commented on is they stepped up and responded well. One of the things that Jim mentioned also is the replenishment of some of the raw materials and packaging costs at less than favorable prices. That’s something that I think you’ve seen us manage through facing any kind of rising commodity prices, decreases in commodity prices et cetera. And we’ll continue to manage that. There is no severe impact going forward on that.
Jim McCann: I would say going forward, we think that our prices will normalize. I think we’ll try to look at the opportunity for some margin improvement.
Dan Kurnos: And on the long-term replacement plan for the distribution facility?
Bill Shea: From that standpoint, we have a long-term lease at that Maple Heights facility to the extent it’s really in the hand of the landlord. If he rebuilt that facility, then we are committed to move back into the facility. But that’s up to the landlord at this point in time.
Chris McCann: But in the meantime, we are operating as I mentioned in a great facility right nearby. This way, we’re able to keep our management team, our employee base in place, and we’re very fortunate to get that facility so quickly and so nearby.
Jim McCann: One asterisk there is the Stockyards business that we created a couple of years ago, it was totally knocked out of commission in that fire, because it’s fulfillment was there in Maple Heights alongside Fannie May. Bill also mentioned in his remarks that it was one of our floral fulfillment sites too. That we were able to distribute as volume across our other sites. Stockyards, we move to the Harry & David even Ohio facility where they had the capacity and facilities there to move that business, and that would likely stay there.
Dan Kurnos: Great. And then just on the Consumer Floral side, since FTD acquired Pro, have you seen them scale back any of their advertising especially around Valentine’s Day. We know Pro has been especially aggressive around Valentine’s Day in the past but with it falling on weekend this year. Is there any room for them to pull back going to be seen at the market place?
Chris McCann: I think it’s really been a month since that deal is closed. We have not really seen anything nor do we anticipate any real change this quickly from them. It is short-time driven. So I think as we move into the Valentine’s season, we’ll expect that all very promotional activity from both those brands, FTD and ProFlowers. Heavy discounting were expected as we go through the holiday. But again as you’ve seen, we continue to grow, we continue to increase our profitability on the bottomline which shows that 1-800-FLOWERS brand is very well-positioned in the competitive landscape.
Dan Kurnos: And just last one for me then since you gave some good color on expected cost synergies, just any thought on timing or quantity for revenue synergies?
Jim McCann: Yeah. I think the revenue synergies, those are usually a little more difficult to quantify and also I think maybe somewhat longer term, especially as we focused on our multi-brand customer strategy. That’s where we increased the [PP] [ph] rate and the frequency. What we are seeing already though from the holidays, some cross-merchandising opportunities that we saw, we saw a strong response to the Harry & David branded products. On the 1-800-FLOWERS website, we will be digging in, doing some direct marketing, picking up on the learning, analyzing the test that we put in Play Store in the holiday, and driving forward on some direct marketing capabilities, focusing on the customer database integration, and then also focusing on the website as we move to Harry & David brands on to the multi-brand website later in the year.
Dan Kurnos: All right. Great. Thanks for all the color. And nice holiday quarter, guys.
Jim McCann: Thank you.
Chris McCann: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.
Jeff Stein: Good morning, guys. First question on Harry & David, wondering if you could talk a little bit about their various operating segments, because it looks to me if I did my math correctly like Harry & David’s aggregative revenues were down a little bit year-on-year. So if look at direct marketing, the retail segment, and their wholesale segment, can you talk a little bit about how each of those segments performed?
Jim McCann: Yeah. Jeff, although actually Harry & David grew about 3% year-over-year during the quarter, they were impacted by -- slightly by the purchase accounting adjustment, the $1.6 million that came out of that. Most of that growth came from -- all of that growth really did come from the…
Chris McCann: Direct marketing…
Jim McCann: Direct marketing side of it. Retail is the much smaller piece of it that grew as well.
Jeff Stein: Okay. So if we look at the cost synergies over the next three years, any sense in terms of the timeline, will you capture -- if you look at fiscal 2016, would you capture a third of that, would it be a third, a third, a third, or how do you see that splitting up? And how much of that would you estimate might be captured through reduction of losses at retail, which last year totaled about $9 million?
Jim McCann: Well, I think it’s all in how you calculate the retail side of it. I would expect that over the three years, it’d be a little bit more heavily weighted to the beginning. You’ll see growth synergies kick in later in that cycle. So if you look at the brand, it might look equally, equally distributed across the three, but the cost side savings would be earlier and the revenue side savings would be larger. The retail business all depends on allocations. And we are looking at the overall cost structure of the combined enterprise. And we’ll try and rationalize that as we get the product of these different work streams at the leadership of Harry & David and the other 1-800-FLOWERS existing brands now work through those work streams.
Chris McCann: Yeah. And Jeff the $9 million number is like a fully allocated -- is a fully allocated number, that’s not really the contribution from those stores that the loss is a much lower number than that on a true contribution basis. We have the relatively short-term leases overall throughout their portfolio and we’ll continue to evaluate. We have a work stream in place to look at retail and look at the performance of retail.
Jim McCann: And experiment with other growth opportunities within retail.
Jeff Stein: So if we look at $15 million of synergies, I just want to make sure I understand this correctly, is part of that expected revenue synergies and part of it is cost, or is it all cost?
Jim McCann: That’s all cost synergies.
Chris McCann: And again all the three years.
Jim McCann: That’s right.
Jeff Stein: Right, exactly. And as far as adding Harry & David to the multi-brand portal, can you give us some sense in terms on what the timing of that might be and what the issues might be to get it onto the portal? Chris, what are your early indications telling you there?
Chris McCann: Yeah. So we’ll be looking to have that on to the multi-brand portal by the next holiday season. Again, while we are in the process of doing from the integration, as Bill mentioned, different work stream is included in the IT work stream, putting together all what all the key priorities are. Clearly that is one of if not the top priority. We’ll need to dig in and do the feature functionality, GAAP analysis, understand what full development needs to be done. Our things are different features and functions in the same kind of services oriented architecture that we developed in, those things will need to be done. So that planning is underway now, but clearly from a -- our target would be next holiday season.
Jim McCann: It doesn’t make much of a difference before that.
Jeff Stein: Got it. And Bill wondering if could talk a little bit about the impact of the Saturday placement on Valentine’s Day? And then looking out a little bit further if you could talk about how you see the timing of Easter this year versus last year affecting each segment of the business?
Jim McCann: Bill, if you would take that. I think what you see is a preface to Bill’s comments is you really now with the addition of Harry & David and the related brands and their concentration of business around the key calendar for the holiday season. You really need to look at us as a full year business now. And Bill, give colors on those specifically on Valentine’s Day.
Bill Shea: On Valentine’s Day, the last time Valentine’s Day fell on a Saturday was Valentine’s Day 2009. The business was down substantially, was down over 20% that holiday, that also was coming off of the meltdown in the financial markets that happened in the fall -- started in the fall of that year. We are building into our plans that the holiday will be down -- will be down double digits, low double digits for this holiday season both, but profitability will be at or above last year for that holiday season. The Easter was -- Easter on the 5th versus later in the month last year, you pull some of that into the third quarter this year. So it does kind of equalize that we’ll have components of consumer flow, which will fill the -- in the fourth quarter, but you’ll have from both Harry & David and from rest of the GFGB brands will really be mostly in the third quarter.
Jim McCann: We’ve always said, Jeff, as you recall, with Easter getting close to the quarter’s edge there, that you really needed to look particularly at our gift food businesses as a second half business and now the additional Harry & David, you’ll get that color on Easter from Bill and he’s already built that into our plans, but we more and more on our full year business.
Jeff Stein: Got it. Okay, guys. Thanks a lot and congrats.
Jim McCann: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti & Company.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Good morning. So my first question is on the multi-brand website that you’ve had it for last couple of months. What are you seeing in terms of improvements in your AOV and order frequency, if you could give us some metrics that’d be very helpful?
Jim McCann: Sure. Anthony, it’s still very early to be able to really point to anything in frequency. We are seeing good early signs of traction and keep in mind we moved the gourmet food brands on to the website during the -- this past fiscal quarter. We moved flowers traffic on to the website this past month. So now we are starting to see even more activity of course tab shopping. And then there’s a lot of experimentation going on still, leaving creative, how we put the tabs out there, how we display that differently, how we introduce the rewards program and the passport program. We are seeing some activity that points to, as I mentioned, the expected repeat rate and the expected increase in average spend in a given year from the customers. So what we’re seeing is encouraging because its holding up what we’ve anticipated happing. It’s too short of the timeframe to really see any impact.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Okay. I got it. And as far as for the quarter just the AOV if you were to exclude Harry & David, do you have that, perhaps handy?
Bill Shea: Yeah. It would be basically flat year-over-year, right, in that $55 range.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And also you talked about the making some investments in the second half of fiscal ’15? Can you give us a little bit more details about that?
Jim McCann: Sure. Bill, I cover that for you. This is Jim. And but already baked into our number would be any of that expense, so it’s not an addition to anything we’ve reported, but Bill, you have consultants working with this on the integration plan. I assume that’s one of the expenses that would popup in the second half of this fiscal year?
Bill Shea: That’s really the primary investments. As we look at our work streams and some of the more longer term initiatives that we have, which is looking at both West Coast and Midwest manufacturing and distribution, those would require more capital investments, but that would not happen in this fiscal year. What we are talking this fiscal year is probably more the kind of outside consultants…
Jim McCann: Outside consultant fee, software.
Bill Shea: … and some IT software, right.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Okay. Thank you for that. And any new updates on FruitBouquets, as far as what there coverage is, if you could give us -- fill us on that that be great?
Chris McCann: Yeah. So, I mean, FruitBouquets, we continue to be very excited about and continue to make good progress there. What we see is, we’ve said that in last quarter, I think, we said, we will be more than, greater than 50% coverage and it continues to grow. And FruitBouquets for us, really, as evidence by what we’ve been saying previously the great appeal it has with our customers. It’s a great example of how we continue to build out our strategy of creating celebratory ecosystem for our customers and finding products and the appropriate product expansion that continues to meet the need that [Technical Difficulty] intended the taste of our customers here. So we continue to see good sales growth in FruitBouquets.
Jim McCann: I think, to follow-up on, Chris’s comment, I think, the investment in the pipeline of products and services that appeal to our customers that they request from us like we did now a couple of years ago with FruitBouquets is an example of why 1-800-FLOWERS.COM is a brand is able to grow and grow nicely, and improve their margins at the time when others are contracting or when the category as a whole, they’re struggling. So I think it’s the innovative merchandising and product introductions that we’ve introduced there in the 1-800-FLOWERS brand like FruitBouquets that’s helping that grow.
Anthony Lebiedzinski: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Jim McCann: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Juan Bejarano from Noble Financial.
Juan Bejarano: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Many of the questions has been asked, but I was just wondering, if you can talk a little bit about, if there are going to be any additional merger-related cost that will be coming up in the upcoming quarter or are all these costs behind us? And I have a few other questions.
Jim McCann: Sure. Bill will handle that one for you first.
Bill Shea: Yeah. From a pure transaction standpoint, those costs are behind us. As we’re talking about earlier, there could be some integration cost that we incur in the second half of the year, but from a transaction standpoint those costs are behind us.
Jim McCann: So it’s not in anyway to shape our expectations in terms of the guidance we’ve given for the full year.
Bill Shea: Correct.
Juan Bejarano: Okay. Thank you. And then on the Consumer Floral, I was quite positive better than we had expected. Can you maybe talk about the segment? Do you believe you’re taking share from other players, or are you just growing with the market?
Jim McCann: I would tell you that the only public data we have available for the category that’s near term, near time indicates that if we are the largest in the category and we are growing on the largest base that that’s likely coming in someway from our competition. But frankly, we think that we can continue to grow regardless of what the overall category does because of how merchants have innovated and iterated their lines of products that we have available to help our customers express themselves and connect. We’ll continue to use the very cost effective vehicle of 1-800-FLOWERS to attract and introduce customers to our celebratory ecosystem and our hope is to be able to monetize them with lower price points and higher price points, with all the other wonderful gifting products that we’ve introduced, whether its our Cheryl's Cookies or it’s our -- now our Harry & David or Moose Munch program. So the whole idea is, if we can attract them cost effectively and do that in a growing business environment like we are in the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brand, have the multi-channel, the omni-channel multi-product, multi-brand strategy of the web environment to lure those customers with our rewards programs, with our passport programs, with their ability to earn and burn points and introduce them to those other products. We feel that we have a shot at changing the floral category and making the introduction to our broader gifting category.
Juan Bejarano: Hey, thank you. That’s helpful. And then on the social front. You obviously worked closely with Facebook and launch the just because campaign. Can you maybe discuss -- well first, your relationship with the Facebooks of the world and then how is the just because campaign growing? And maybe, are there any other ideas that you launched products that you launched to reach a younger demographic?
Jim McCann: Chris will give you the color on the relationships, we work hard to develop and maintain there. I think what we’ve said in the past is the fact that back in that period of 2008, 2009 when we had to make some tough decisions about which programs we’d invest in, the good news is we always remain comfortably profitable during that period and we were able to invest for the future, not to the breadth that we would have liked but we still had a half a dozen investment programs underway. One of those was mobile and another was social. And mobile has just exaggerated the impact of social on our lives. And so we said, back then that we were on our way to becoming a mobile, social commerce company. And now you hear us refer to the omni-channel and multi brand. And I think that decision that we made back -- before that to introduce other products. And during the ’08, ‘09 and ‘10 periods that were tougher as a result of recession, we continue to invest because we knew that social, aided and abetted by the introduction of smartphones was just going to increase. And I think our teams have done a reasonably good job of keeping us in the forefront of activities that help us deepen our relationship to social media, with our customers and expand our customer base in those channels.
Chris McCann: Yeah. It’s always been a focus of ours to make sure that we’re staying innovative as a company, especially in the area of embracing new technology. Excuse me. So that’s what we coined and that we feel and maintain relationships, not just with the Googles and the Facebooks of the world, Instagram, Twitter but all the new emerging platforms and new capabilities that are coming up. And being very to experiment and that’s what helps build those relationships and continue it. And as far as some of the learnings that we got with the just because initiative, you will continue to see us in each of our different brands, find different products like our cookie cards and some of the other products that we’ve introduced, that really help us have that entry point purchase to bring customers into that Celebratory ecosystem. And then allow us to kick in all of the marketing programs that we’ve been discussing to really manage and build and to grow that relationship.
Jim McCann: Hi. Just to follow-up on Chris’s point, this is Jim. One, Chris has charged each of our brands with mimicking the strategy that we have in the Cheryl’s brand, in terms of introducing entry level price points, not only for people to use on those everyday occasions like birthdays or get well or new baby or just because, but they do it with a broader breadth of our products. So, I think you will see a more efforts from us in that regard because of the success we have seen, because of low price point in the Cheryl’s product.
Juan Bejarano: Okay. Great. Thank you. It was very helpful. That’s it for me.
Jim McCann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.
Jeff Stein: Okay. Couple of financial questions. First of all, wondering, Bill, if you could talk about the adjusted gross margin at Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets, excluding Harry & David? Was it up, down or flat to last year? And that would be again adjusted but excluding Harry & David.
Bill Shea: Okay. So, adjusted would be relatively flat year-over-year. The reported number would have been lower but that was because of the impact of the Fannie May fire.
Jim McCann: Because Jeff, we had a fire about the same.
Bill Shea: About the same, yes.
Jeff Stein: Okay. Great. And wondering will there be any additional purchase accounting adjustments in the third quarter or fourth quarter?
Bill Shea: No.
Jeff Stein: Okay. And then final financial question. You had a roughly $13.5 million negative effect on revenues in Q2. What do you guesstimate the revenue effect will be in Q3 and will it extent beyond Q3?
Bill Shea: In Q3, we think it’s going to be in the $7 million range. We lost a whole bunch of Valentine's-related kind of boxes and packaging that caused some miss on the wholesale revenues that we have in the quarter. So probably net to the $2 million to $3 million range from the topline perspective.
Jeff Stein: Into the fourth quarter, do you think?
Bill Shea: Don’t leave into the fourth quarter. Well, we don’t know as we go into the future into the next fiscal year, as we cycle around into the next holiday season -- do we lose some revenues that we lost this year does not come back to us. You’re not going to know that until we get into the holiday cycle next year.
Jeff Stein: Okay.
Jim McCann: And there is potential upside there as well, Jeff, it’s not downside because some of the -- we had such success leading such good trend line as I mentioned leading in. Some of those customers that can move the needle with single waters have been very receptive to the efforts that we have made to ameliorate these difficulties and there could be some upside there as well.
Jeff Stein: Okay. So you don’t see any damaged relationships as you indicated earlier?
Jim McCann: No. On the contrary, I think the relationships are deeper and stronger.
Jeff Stein: Okay. And the final question would be relating to Harry & David. Can you talk about some of the metrics that you typical cite for your core business, such as how many new customers specifically did Harry & David generate during the holiday season? What was their repeat rate relative to last year? And can you talk about maybe the slip between their online and catalog sales and what kind of growth they registered in each of those segments?
Chris McCann: Well Jeff, if still fill in where he can on this, there’s a limit to how specific we’re going to get that. Trend lines continue a pace at Harry & David that they have seen in the last prior two years in terms of that 3% growth rate, consistent average tickets and basically flat acquisition cost. One point you made was the difference between catalog and e-commerce sales and there really is not as difference. What we have found here in Harry & David brand is the same thing we’ve done when we had other catalog brands. The catalog now is simply a marketing tool that he gets response whether it’s telephonic or online customer sales which is all e-commerce of sorts. So Bill, any other color did you there?
Bill Shea: Yeah. I mean, they had about $2 million orders during the quarter. Their repeat rate is slightly higher than the Flowers brand. But it’s not significantly higher but the fact that they still use a catalog as their main source of marketing and stimulus, they hit the existing customer base more so they are slightly higher than us. Their ALVs are well over $100 and that’s why we had the big list in overall ALV from 55 into that and that ALV was consistent with last year.
Jeff Stein: And that ALV, is it consistent from past year?
Bill Shea: So consistent in the gift food and gift basket brands for the legacy flowers business consistent ALV there. And on top of that the Harry & David ALV was consistent with their last year number.
Chris McCann: Yeah. And final point on kid of new customers, it was relatively split evenly between Harry & David -- and it is excluding Harry & David during the quarter.
Jeff Stein: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Thank you. And I have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to management for any closing comments.
Jim McCann: Thank you, Karen. I think as we’ve evolved, I’ve mentioned a few times that because of the impact of the Harry & David and related brands acquisition, it really does become more important to review the company as a full year company, because comparison with prior years will be a little bit distorted. And the way we view it now we have two distinct business types. We have a wider service business which is good in growing business with very attractive margins. And then they have a billion dollar consumer Gift business, which is growing about 5% organically. It has good and improving margins. We have a pipeline of exciting new products that will stimulate their customer interest we think. We’re focused on the growth particularly in the Gift Food segments where it is growing as a category. We have an omni-channel, multi brands customer strategy which we think is already starting to show is benefits. And I think, we’re starting to benefit from strategic decisions. We were fortunate enough to make years ago, just starting to really pardon the pun, bear some fruit here. I think all the above decisions us to capture and there were larger share of our customers wallet in that whole celebratory gifting space. So we think we’re well positioned for the future. We’re pleased with what we’re able to deliver this quarter and we expect to do similar things in the quarters ahead. So thank you for your time and interest today, and please don’t forget to value those folks in your life with the appropriate Valentine’s gift.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day."
