Cliff Sifford: Thank you, and welcome to Shoe Carnival’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today is Kerry Jackson, Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Operating and Financial Officer. On today’s call, I’ll provide a brief overview of annual operating highlights and our fourth quarter results, as well as an overview of our fiscal year 2017 guidance. Kerry will review the financial results and then we’ll open up the call to take questions. During this call, we’ll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of non-cash impairment charges related to long-lived assets associated with seven of our Puerto Rico stores. The non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as alternatives for, our reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our reported results determine in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is included in the financial tables of our earnings release. Fiscal 2016 represent a significant corporate milestone for us, our net sales exceeded $1 billion. I am very pleased with this accomplishment which reflects the hard work and dedicated efforts of our store associates and corporate team. Over the last several years we have benefited from the execution of our strategic initiatives including our disciplined store approach strategy, our strong merchandising efforts as we deliver a compelling offering of branded moderately priced family footwear, our multi-channel sales capabilities, our expanded digital and national marketing presence, and our extremely loyal and growing customer base. Our relentless focus on efficiently managing our business through both favorable and challenging operating environment has served us well. Today, we currently have stores in 35 states and we believe the future opportunities for growth in large and smaller markets is tremendous as we work together to achieve our next $1 billion in sales. In addition, we are fortunate to have the financial flexibility through the strength of our balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation to support our growth and return value to shareholders in fiscal 2017 and beyond. Now I'd like to focus on our strategic initiatives in a little more detail. In fiscal 2016, we continued to see growth at our royalty programs Shoe Perks. For the year our loyal shoppers accounted for approximately 66% of our net sales. Our Shoe Perks' members are not only loyal but they love shoes and they show it by spending on average 19% more per transaction than non-members. Even with the successful of our Shoe Perks program, we believe we can do better at consistently finding ways to actively engage our most loyal customers. In 2017, our team is tasked with the key objective of leveraging the wealth of customer data we have available. We will create targeted communications that appeal to our Shoe Perk members and their unique family footwear need in the pursuit of increasing shopper frequency. We believe we can improved our overall performance by utilizing our customer information in marketing, merchandising, ecommerce as well as real-estate. It really is an incredibly valuable resource for us to leverage as we move forward. While we remain committed to the acquisition of new members, we believe identifying our high valued customers how they shop and how best to retain them will deliver increased sales and better margins over the longer term. In addition, we are offering our customers the option of signaling up the Shoe Perks through SMS. This allows us to send offers and Shoe Perks related information directly to their mobile devices. Our team has done an excellent job with our multi-channel strategy as consumers shopping habit continue to evolve. It has been a priority for us to enhance our digital store experience over the past few years. As we have discussed in recent quarter our much-anticipated launch of Shoe Carnivals buy online, pickup in store and buy online, ship to store initiative begin in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We are very pleased with the early results of this program as our customers embrace this opportunity in greater numbers than anticipated. In fiscal 2017 we look forward to our next digital sales enhancement strategies, including our new mobile app which we'll launch in the next few months. A new and improved digital store front that'll allow us the opportunity to give our online shoppers the same surprise and delight they experience when shopping at Shoe Carnival brick-and-mortar store and the development of vendor drop ship. Vendor drop ship will allow us to expand our assortment with key brands without the risks of inventory ownership. From a real estate perspective, we ended the year with 415 stores in the U.S. in Puerto Rico. For the year, we opened 19 stores, closed 9 stores and relocated 3 stores. For the fourth quarter, we opened 4 stores and closed 4 stores. Our short growth plan continues to focus on strong trade areas within our current footprint. We consistently evaluate and take our underperforming stores that have minimal opportunity to improve and either renegotiate lease terms, relocate or close the store. It was just a year ago that we discuss our opportunity of open stores and key small markets across the U.S. We continue to be pleased with the non-small market stores, we opened over the past 15 months. Our small market stores are running well ahead of our first-year expectation in both sales and margin. Our strategy for 2017 and 2018 is for approximately two-thirds of our new stores, we opened to be a small and mid-market location. Our mid-market stores generally operate the smaller markets just outside of large city and based on the volume expectations, these stores average of 7,000 square feet in size and are planned at approximately 80% of traditional store model. For fiscal 2017, we plan to open approximately 20 new stores, 3 will be in smaller markets, 9 in mid-markets and 7 in traditional markets. In addition, we will close approximately 15 stores and relocate 3 stores. It is important to note that the majority of these new store openings are focused on filling in the designated market areas, we currently operate. Any move that we make will be in mid-sized market where we expect to leverage our strong new brand recognition. We believe continued discipline approach to new market opening is very important as we pursue opportunities for short growth in large mid and smaller markets, as well as leverage our multi-channel sales strategy. Now I’d like to review our performance for the fourth quarter and the initial view on fiscal 2017. Overall, fourth quarter comparable sales were in line with the updated annual guidance we provided in January. And our gross profit margin came in better than anticipated. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter decreased 1.2%, store traffic was down mid-single digits, unit’s performance transaction were flat in conversion and average transaction were up slightly. With the combination of highly promotional activity on seasonal products in the tremendous growth of our multi-channel initiatives, merchandised margin finished the quarter down 130 basis points. We ended the year with inventory down $13.2 million, which included 10 additional net stores open or down 6.8% on a per share basis versus at prior year. Our team prudently managed our expenses, it should be noted that during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recorded $4.3 million of non-cash impairment charges of which $3.6 million was for 7 stores in Puerto Rico which Kerry will discuss in more detail. SG&A adjusted to exclude the Puerto Rico impairment charges for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 increased $700,000 to 62.4 million or 26.6% of net sales, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year period. From the merchandise perspective, Athletic footwear remained a key category throughout the course. Our merchandising has done a terrific job in offering a broad assortment of great Athletic brands that our customers know that can consistently find in our stores. By department, women's non-Athletic footwear ended of the quarter down mid-single digits compared to same period last year on a comparable basis. Women's boots end of the quarter slightly negative on a comparable store basis. We are able to accelerate units but at lower retail price. Importantly, boot inventories were down double digit in every category except rain boots, hikers and booties. The merchant team did an outstanding job with aggressive promotions is a clear through seasonal boots. Women sandals ended the quarter with a comparable store increased in mid-teens. Men Athletic footwear -- men's non-Athletic footwear was down low single digits on a comparable store basis versus the prior year period. Similar to our results in women, our men sandals sales were up in teens on the comparable basis. We also experienced increases in men casual boots particularly in the hiking category. Kids footwear end of the quarter flat on a comparable basis with non-Athletic down mid-single and Athletic up low single. The non-Athletic footwear increased mid-single digits on a comparable basis driven by both men's and women's product categories. Now I would like to give you a little color on our fiscal 2017 guidance. We cannot update you on our first quarter performance due to tax refund delays and the shift of Easter. As I mentioned earlier per store inventory was down 6.8% at the beginning of fiscal 2017. We believe the strong Athletic footwear cycle we experienced during 2016 will continue in 2017 and we will ensure that our inventory positions will take advantage of that Athletic trend going forward. We are also pleased with the early results from our casual sandal footwear. In the fall, we will plan boots cautiously with the expectation of selling pure units. We believe this cautious approach will allow us to increase average unit retail and margin in the boot category. Therefore, we expect full year net sales to be in the range of 1.028 billion to 1.040 billion with comparable store sales flat to up low single digits. Earnings per diluted share expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.54 included in the earnings estimate for the year is the expectation that the high end of our guidance gross profit margin will be up approximately 30 basis points with slight leverage of our buying, distribution and occupancy cost. We expect SG&A will be flat as a percentage of sales. It is also important to note that fiscal 2017 is a 53-week year with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter. We estimate the 53rd week sales to be approximately $15 million and will be slightly accretive to the fiscal 2017 earnings per diluted share. That concludes my overview I would now like to turn the call over to Kerry. Kerry?
Kerry Jackson: Thank you, Cliff, and good afternoon everyone. Fourth quarter net sales increased to $234.2 million compared to $233.7 million in the fourth quarter last year. The net sales increase was driven by sales of $5.0 million from the 21 new stores opened since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. This net sales increase was partially offset by a $2.8 million decrease in comp store sales and a $1.7 million loss in sales from the 10 stores closed since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Our gross profit margin for the quarter was 27.5% compared to 29.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Due to promotional selling in Q4 and margin pressures from cost associated with our multichannel business our merchandized margin decreased to 130 basis points and our buying distribution and occupancy expenses as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points due primarily to higher occupancy cost. As a reminder, we typically need a 2% to 3% comp increased to leverage our occupancy cost. Selling general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 increased 4.2 million to 65.9 million or 28.1% of sales. SG&A in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 included non-cash impairment charges of 3.6 million for seven Puerto Rico stores. Excluding these non-cash impairment charges adjusted SG&A increased $668,000 to 62.4 million or 26.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. In addition to the non-cash impairment charges for our Puerto Rico stores. Store closing and impairment charges included in both cost of sales and SG&A in Q4 this year were 1.0 million compared to $701,000 in Q4 last year. There were no non-cash impairment charges of long lived assets for our Puerto Rico stores in fiscal 2015. Pre-opening cost included in both cost of sales and SG&A increased 23,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to 196,000. The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was 39.8% compared to 36.0% for the same period in fiscal 2015. Net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $0.9 million or a loss of $0.05 per diluted share. Including in the fourth quarter of 2016 were the previously mentioned non-cash impairment charges of $0.12 per diluted share. Adjusted net income was 1.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 net earnings were 4.2 million or $0.21 per diluted share. I would now like to transitioned to our full-year fiscal 2016 results. Fiscal 2016 net sales increased 17.1 million to 1.001 billion compared to fiscal 2015. Comparable store sales increased 0.5% the net sales increase was driven by sales of $23.3 million from the 39 new stores opened since the beginning of fiscal 2015 and a $4.7 million increase in comp store sales. This net sales increase was partially offset by a $10.9 million loss in sales from the 24 stores closed since the beginning of fiscal 2015. The gross profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 28.9% compared to 29.5% last year. Merchandise margin decreased 60 basis points while buying distribution and occupancy cost as a percentage of sales remained flat compared to the prior year. SG&A for the fiscal 2016 increased $7.4 million to $251.3 million or 25.1% of net sales. For fiscal 2016 SG&A included in the previously mentioned non-cash impairment charges of $3.6 million. Excluding these non-cash impairment charges, adjusted SG&A increased $3.9 million to $247.8 million or 24.8% of net sales in fiscal 2016. Net earnings for fiscal 2016 were $23.5 million or $1.28 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $28.8 million or $1.45 per diluted share in fiscal 2015. Adjusted net income was $25.7 million or $1.40 per diluted share for fiscal 2016. Now turning to information affecting cash flow in fiscal 2016. We declared and paid cash dividend in this quarter fiscal 2016. During the first quarter, we paid cash dividend of $0.065 per share and during the second, third and fourth quarters we paid cash dividends of $0.07 per share to our shareholders. The cumulative amount of dividends returned to shareholders in fiscal 2016 was $5.0 million. During the fourth quarter our board authorized a new share purchase program for up to $50 million of outstanding common stock effective January 1, 2017. The previous plan expires December 2016. During Q4, we've repurchased 285,000 at a total cost of $7.2 million for the full year of fiscal 2016, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $42.6 million. For the first quarter of this year through yesterday we have repurchased through our rule 10B5-1 repurchase plan approximately 361,000 shares at a cost of $9.2 million. During fiscal 2016 we have spent $21.8 million for the purchase of property and equipment, of which $16.4 million was for new stores remodels and relocations. Incentives we received from landlords were $4.3 million. Depreciation expense was $6.0 million in Q4, depreciation expense was $23.7 million for the full fiscal year. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year were $62.9 million and we have no bank debt outstanding. I'd now like to add a little -- briefly discuss forecasted cash flow information for fiscal 2017 and add a little color on our Q1 earnings expectations. Capital expenditures are expected to be $22 million to $23 million at fiscal 2017. As Cliff mentioned, fiscal 2017 we expect to open approximately 20 stores which will account for approximately 10 million to 11 million of our total capital expenditures. Approximately 6 million of the total capital expenditure we used for store relocations and remodels -- remodeling of approximately 5% of our existing store base. The funds we received from landlords are expected to approximately $4 million to $5 million. Included in our earnings expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 is a comp store sales increased to be flat to up slightly. Additionally, we expect our gross profit margin will increase but will be partially offset by an expected increase in our SG&A as a percentage of sales compared to Q1 last year. We expect to open 7 stores in Q1 and close 5. This concludes our financial review. Now I’d like to open up the call for questions
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we’ll take our first question from Mitch Kummetz with B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead.
Mitch Kummetz: I think I got three questions just kind of on the guidance, so I guess these are all for Kerry. So, Kerry, you just mentioned on Q1 gross margin up a bit, SG&A up a bit. I mean do those offset, are you’re looking for kind EBIT margin to be flat year-over-year and can you maybe speak a little bit to kind of what you’re expecting on the gross margin side. Because I know that you have a reasonably easy comparison in terms of Merch margin, I think Merch margin was down like 90 bps last year in Q1. So I’m kind of curious how you think about that?
Kerry Jackson: We do expect our gross profit margin increased to be higher than increase in our SG&A. However, we’re not planning to do a full recovery of the loss of the gross profit margin that we had sustained in Q1 last year.
Mitch Kummetz: Got it, okay. That’s helpful. And then on the year, I think you mentioned that the Merch margin was down 60 bps on the year. I know you guide on gross margin for 2017 is up 30. It sounds like the majority, if not all of that is coming in terms of BD&O leverage. How are you thinking about Merch margin opportunity over the course of the year, particularly in Q4 were your Merch margin was down 130 bps this past quarter?
Kerry Jackson: What we are looking at is, we continue to have headwinds against our merchandised margin on our multi-channel initiatives. We’re expecting to see a significant increase continuing in our ecommerce and other multi-channel initiatives and with that comes the higher cost structure associated with that. So that's one reason you are seeing it, not aggressively growing our gross profit margin on a year-over-year basis. We do expect to see the fourth quarter to be a higher rate, one of the higher rate for the first quarter, for the year per quarter.
Mitch Kummetz: Got it. In terms of the improvement?
Kerry Jackson: Right.
Mitch Kummetz: Okay. And then lastly just really a housekeeping question. Is there kind of underlying tax rate and share count assumption on the earnings range for the year?
Kerry Jackson: What we are looking at for the tax rate is what we -- at more of a historical rate, about 38 in the quarter and the fully diluted shares for the year we are projecting to continue to do some buybacks and we expect those to be with that taken into account a little over 70 million shares outstanding on a dilute basis at the end of the year.
Mitch Kummetz: Okay, great. Thanks guys, good luck.
Operator: Our next question comes from Randy Konik with Jefferies Group.
Randy Konik: I guess a question for Cliff, you gave us the statistic on the Shoe Perks royalty program, I think you said 66% of sales and the purchase, I guess total amount was about 19% higher than non-members, any kind of data on the member's frequency of purchases versus as worst kind of non-members in the system? I am kind of curious on if you are seeing kind of a lift in visits per quarter or something like that? And you mentioned the opportunity to increase engagement, give us some kind of perspective on what kind of strategies you are going to use to reach out to both I guess to existing Shoe Perks member, but also kind of strategies you are going to use to engage potential new members to drive new member sign ups, just curious there? Thanks.
Cliff Sifford: No problem, Randy. We have done a great job over the past four years of getting people to sign up for Shoe Perks, what we have not done a good job of is reengaging with those customers that may have dropped off or been inactive. So that is a focus of our, as we move through 2017, just to reengage with any of those customers that may not be as active as we want them to be. From a shopping standpoint, from a frequency standpoint, I don’t have that number in front of me. I know that we measure that. The number of times a customer shops per quarter or within a year, I apologies, I don’t have that number with me today. However, we recognize that we have a wealth of data out there from not only from our Shoe Perks members, but from the ecommerce site as well and our plan this year is to dig into that wealth of data. And looking for customers that haven't yet signed up for Shoe Perks and that’s how we expect to grow that program this year, not only in our store base, but in our brick-and-mortar base and online, but with the amount of data that we have throughout all our touch points. That’s how we expect to get worked out of that. I hope that answered your question with the exception of one data point I didn’t have.
Randy Konik: Yes, it helpful. And then maybe give us some perspective on, you talked about early successes in the small and mid-market strategy relative to the traditional market strategy on a store markets, can you give some perspective on how you are thinking about margin by class of stores and how that maybe different near term versus long term, just trying to getting perspective on how we should be thinking about medium term EBIT margin structure for the company? Thanks.
Cliff Sifford: Well, the best -- let me see if I can -- let's talk about the mid and the small quickly. We have seen -- we are not looking to expand right now outside of that current footprint, as I've said in my prepared remarks, but what we want to do is take advantage of the customer that knows us so well in our current footprint. So that's saves us from a marketing expense, you don’t have to go into a large market and buy a local TV. So that saves from a marketing expense. We also don’t plan, especially in our small markets, to be as promotional as we are in our larger market. So we're going to look for margin expansion there. We don’t give margin by segment or by store delineation, so I'm not -- I'm afraid I can't share much with you on that other than the we fact that we expect our small market stores to draw out a higher margin and right now I don’t have enough history on our mid-market stores in fact we've just opened up our first one this past quarter, so a first coupled -- so you got to give more some more time on that. But the way we have perform in those stores was to run at a higher margin rate than our traditional store.
Randy Konik: Got it, alright. Thanks so much I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Pham with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Alex Pham: I guess first question in the first quarter guidance assumption for comps of flat to up slightly, is that sort of an acceleration from -- are we assuming acceleration from what you guys are seeing quarter-to-date? I'm just kind of get a feel for how you are thinking about the first quarter from [Multiple Speakers] perspective?
Cliff Sifford: Well, the first quarter is dependent upon two factors, when tax refunds come out because our customer is driven -- is almost like a second back to school for us when tax refunds season hits, and Easter, and Easter moved three weeks later. So we've naturally expected for comps to accelerate later in the quarter then last year because of the shift of Easter.
Alex Pham: Got it, that's helpful. And I guess if we could touch on the Athletic portion of the business for a second. It seems like it's been a real driver of growth for you guys. How are you guys planning the category for 2017, do we think as a -- from a penetration perspective that it's going to grow as a percentage of sales and is there a margin impact associated with that?
Cliff Sifford: So the answer to your second question is, we don’t anticipate a margin impact to that. Right now Athletic is and has been for the last three maybe four years ahead of this category we have and we do look Athletic to grow at a higher rate than our athletics. So it will from a penetration standpoint be a larger percentage of our business.
Alex Pham: Got it, and what we're hearing in the athletic categories it seems like competition is really ramping up, should we think of that as a potential benefit for Shoe Carnival as you kind of [indiscernible] from a brand perspective.
Cliff Sifford: Competition heating up from an athletic perspective? Well there are people that are expanding, there are some of our competitors expanding their Athletic product mix. And you know you're always concerned with that anyone that sells Athletic product, I mean that competes with you. However there is quite a few stores for companies that are not surviving, I hate to even say that, but which expands the opportunity for Athletics as an entire business.
Alex Pham: Got it, and then last question. In terms of the vendor drop ship program, how big do you guys think that could be in terms of penetration in the assortment. And any color you guys can share in terms of the maybe financial impacts In terms of margin benefit?
Cliff Sifford: I think I'll give the answer to the second question first, I think margin benefit comes from not having the carry of the merchandise the vendor takes a risk of the merchandise. So in that regard I think that is helpful. To be perfectly honestly, I am not sure what the benefit from a top-line sales standpoint is until we actually get this launched. We'll test it with the few vendors, I think it's going to -- personally I believe it's going to be more important to us in the men's non-Athletic area than any other area because they are the ones that keep stock on hand for fill-ins. So I really don't know, I listen to my friends and retailer that have already done this. It could be of great benefit to us, but I would hate to quantify that for your today.
Alex Pham: Okay. Well thank you very much and best of luck.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Mann with Johnson Rice & Company. Please go ahead.
David Mann: Couple of questions, in terms of the questions about the tax refunds, when you look back at how your sales have trended quarter-to-date, has the rule of tax refunds on that trend played out the way you expected? And do you expect that the later timing of refunds will not have a negative impact on the sales that you would have expected to have if it was similar timing to last year?
Cliff Sifford: David that's a great question. I will tell you that early in the quarter tax refunds had a tremendous effect on our results. And as those tax refunds rolled out we begin to recover at really good rate. We're just not going to know the answer to that until we get through Easter. It's just hard to measure because as our business progresses this week a year ago was Easter week, so even though against our internal plan we're doing well, but you can't know from a comp perspective until you actually get through the Easter week. Not this Easter week but actually three weeks from that during Easter.
David Mann: Got it. In terms of the competitive environment obviously across the board lots of closings from department stores whether it would be Macey's, Penny's, Seers, Payless whomever. When you look at all of those, while they may not be your most direct competitors, how do you see those closings impacting your business? Are you planning to gain some share, building some of that into your guidance for this year?
Cliff Sifford: We have not built that into our guidance at this point. Because all of those closings are also going to involve a going out of business sales. So what you might know then for them actually closing those stores you have to take away from the highly promotional environment they're going to have as they clear their inventory. So I think that would be more of an '18 build than a '17 build. But we do look at that as an opportunity as I guess every recover would that is competing against them.
David Mann: And then lastly, you commented in the release about the early performance of sandals -- casual sandal footwear. Can you just talk a little more about what you’re seeing there and how that may play out for some of the opportunity for positive comps in the first quarter?
Cliff Sifford: David, towards the end of fourth quarter that I wouldn’t blame anything on weather again. But I’m going to have to go back on that and tell you that weather played a key role of those sandal selling in the fourth quarter, it was warmer than expected, warmer than a year ago and it did accelerate sandal sales. The other thing we did from strategies strategic standpoint is that, so we took our warm doors and we increased our sandal selection in those warm doors, and that was a very good strategy and worked out very, very well. Not only did it work out from a sales standpoint, from a sandal comp. But it also told us early on what was selling and we’re able to make sure that we’re properly covered on those sandal items.
David Mann: Very good. Best of luck in ’17.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Greg Pendy with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.
Greg Pendy: My question is, I think you mentioned as we kind of look out to the fourth quarter and we cycle now, boot season. You mentioned that you’re going to bring down, I guess, the inventory and the unit. Does that mean, was there something this year in the data that made you think that or made you see that maybe you can get higher pricing, was there mix going on within the boot season, where the lower price footwear wasn’t selling? Thanks.
Cliff Sifford: No. I'll tell you, what happen was, we plan -- we did not do a great job of planning our boot business. We thought boots were going to be up and as it turned out that was not the case. So we were very promotional on the fourth quarter on boots and clear through. And because that we were very promotional as I mentioned earlier. Even though, we had -- we sold more units. We actually had a slight off of sales. So I clearly feel like that we plan the boots more cautiously and I really don’t want to tell you whether that’s down or flat, but I can tell you that it's not up. If we can -- we won’t have to be as promotional as we were a year ago, which will then drive up our average unit retail and our margin.
Greg Pendy: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Our final question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
Sam Poser: What percent of sales at this point in time were sort of touched by digital? In that, they might have bought on the app, they might coming to the store, because of the app. Can you give any measurement of that right now? How that's impacting units?
Cliff Sifford: I don’t -- from an app standpoint, I don’t have a measurement of that. Here is what I can tell you, with that said. Today Sam, I don’t think we have a sales customer, it feels that way anyway that’s not walking around or store with a mobile phone in their hand, comparing inventory, pricing or whatever. And or maybe looking for coupons. So whether they’re doing that on our app or whether they're doing that through our website or through one of the affiliate marketers that we use. I just know that it's happening more and more.
Sam Poser: All right, thanks for that. I got a couple of more, how many store closed -- how many stores do you plan to close this year and in the first quarter since you gave us the store openings for Q1?
Cliff Sifford: We are looking closing approximately 15 stores for year, Sam and five will be in Q1.
Sam Poser: And about primarily in the back half of the year, likely it normally is that the way to think about it?
Cliff Sifford: It's spread fairly rabidly the final three quarters.
Sam Poser: Okay. Thanks. And then going back to the boots for a second Cliff, when you said you are going to be planning the boots down or flat, and you said you are working to plan the units up. And then I guess the question is, how many units can you sell at a more normalized discount or regular price versus heavy promotion, so when you are thinking about units flat to down, I would think that to avoid promotions, the units would be theoretically planned down a lot, because a lot of your units sales at the end were driven on very aggressive promotions, I would assume?
Cliff Sifford: I would tell you that you are probably correct.
Sam Poser: And --
Cliff Sifford: We are going to plan units down aggressively.
Sam Poser: And then lastly, Cliff or Kerry, do you expect earnings in Q1 to be up or flat, I mean, give us some idea there and also does the guidance assume -- the guidance it's not like it assumed an acceleration of sales in the next five weeks. I know you have Easter coming and Easter generally accelerate, is there -- are you planning any kind of, I guess -- in the guidance is there any difference in the way you are expecting the acceleration to be this year versus other years or anything of that nature? A - Kerry Jackson The only acceleration -- I’ll take the second part of that question Sam, is the only acceleration that we expect to be different is the acceleration of the tax refunds, otherwise we expect Easter to be pretty much comp to last year, in fact we expect it to be comped for the last year.
Sam Poser: And the as far as earnings in the first quarter, Kerry?
Kerry Jackson: I am sorry -- I actually took a drink and started to cough and missed your first part.
Sam Poser: Earnings in Q1, do you -- is it up, down, flat with last year, I mean how do --. A - Kerry Jackson We expect it will be up.
Sam Poser: Okay. Well thank you very much and good luck.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. I’ll now return the conference back over to Mr. Sifford for any additional or closing remarks.
Cliff Sifford: Thank you. And thank you for joining us on our call today and we look forward to talk you on our next conference call. Thanks again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
