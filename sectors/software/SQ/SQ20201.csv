"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Square First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jason Lee: Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. First, we want to remind everyone of the format of our earnings call, we have published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, which was available shortly after the market close. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our sellers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
Jack Dorsey: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We’re going to start with a few remarks from me and Amrita, and then we’ll get to your questions. Before we begin, I want to share our gratitude for all those on the frontlines fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. We will not be able to do our work without the sacrifices you make every moment to do yours. Thank you to our healthcare workers and everyone providing essential services around the world to keep us all healthy and safe. We acknowledge and we appreciate you.
Amrita Ahuja: Thanks, Jack. I hope you all are safe and healthy with your families during this time. And I echo Jack’s comments with gratitude for those on the frontlines of this pandemic. There are three key items, which I’d like to share with you today. First, on our first quarter results, we achieved strong growth in January and February prior to the significant slowdown in our Seller business in the last two weeks of March. Second, on trends in April, we saw early signs of potential stabilization and improvement in our Seller ecosystem with continued strong momentum in Cash App. Third, we believe it’s now more important than ever to invest behind our mission of economic empowerment and service of our customers. First, I’ll look at our overall first quarter results. We achieved strong growth in January and February prior to the slowdown in Seller in the last two weeks of March. Overall, in the first quarter, gross profit was $539 million, up 36% year-over-year or 40% growth year-over-year excluding Caviar. These growth rates are about 10 points lower than what we observed through January and February prior to the impact of COVID-19.
Operator:  Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Great, thanks. Thanks so much for this data. I wanted to ask, I think you sort of touched upon, both of you did, just how you’re approaching risk management on the Seller side both for Square Capital and underwriting in general? It sounds like you are skewing a little bit bigger, which is helping on the quality as you suggested. So just anything else to add to that? And then also just to clarify, because I’m getting some questions on it. The first quarter EBITDA, how much was driven by the higher loss reserve? And I presume that should stabilize if the volumes stabilize. And looking ahead, is it fair to apply a decremental margin that look like your incremental margin when things are going well, I think that was in the 60s. All else equal, is that a good starting point to think about that all else equal? Thank you.
Amrita Ahuja: Hey, Tien-Tsin. I can start this off. Maybe I’ll start us off with your second question around EBITDA impact for the first quarter and then we can tackle the rest of your questions. With respect to EBITDA in the first quarter, which was $9 million, there were two primary impacts. The larger of the impact was related to risk loss reserves, which we will speak to in a moment. The lesser of the impact was the top-line impact and the flow through to margin there. As you noted, high incremental margins on our Seller business, which benefits us obviously as revenues grow. And then we saw the impact in the other direction in terms of decremental margins in the last two weeks of the quarter for Q1. Q1 ex-risk loss, EBITDA would have been up. Even with the impact of the last two weeks of March, EBITDA would have been up 30% year-over-year. The risk loss clearly is the larger impact for Q1. And let me talk through some of the puts and takes with respect to our transaction and loan losses and then we can see if there is more of your question that I’ve missed. So with respect to transaction and loan losses, we booked $109 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by the Seller transaction processing volume in the first quarter, along with our capital loans on balance sheet of just over $160 million. And the way you can look at that is for both of those two areas, the reserve that we took, which is an estimate at this point, the reserve that we took is about 4X higher than the prior quarterly run rate on a dollar basis. So think of Q4. What we took in Q1 was about 4X higher. And to give you a sense of what we’re tracking, we watch charge backs on the Seller side related to non-delivery of goods as one indicating – leading indicator of losses. And what we’ve seen so far in charge backs is actually less than 2X normal levels. However, we know that what we see here is very much dependent on what happens in terms of the duration and severity of the COVID impacts and that we could see additional losses. Hence, we set a provision in reserve that’s 4X the typical levels. On the capital business, similar sort of approach. $22 million provision on the capital loans on our balance sheet, which is about 4X the prior run rate on a dollar basis, but only about 2.5X from a loss rate basis. And similarly, seeing lower in terms of current repayment flows than what we actually booked in the expectation that there would be further impact from COVID. And to your question, we have taken risk mitigating measures to manage our exposure in this very dynamic time. Some of the things that we’ve done on the Seller business are manage our exposure related to higher risk sellers, including assessing some of the industries and products that have been releasing disputes, managed our sellers, for instance, SMS reminders to help assess Square Contract Service, which is a legal framework for extended payment terms. On the capital side, we’ve paused core flex loan originations for now. But as we see stabilization across verticals, across geos and plan to reopen our core flex loan product in the coming weeks and months. And in terms of the future outlook here in terms of risk loss, there are a number of puts and takes, obviously that I mentioned in the intro remarks, there’s the actual losses that flow through in Q1, which could be higher or lower than the reserve assumptions that we have made, there’s future GPV level, and there’s the mix of products that we serve and the mix of verticals and then there is these actions that we’re taking to mitigate our risks as we look forward. So this is an area that could be variable, but we’re very, very focused on monitoring here and taking proactive measures to manage our risk.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller . Your line is open.
Darrin Peller: Hey, thanks guys. Glad to hear you’re all doing okay. Look, first just addressing the questions we get around the resilience of your customers. Is there any early indications you can give us into sense merchants that – the numbers that are managing through this versus perhaps not maybe the mix of merchants we should expect on the other side of this? And then really more importantly looking through 2020, you guys clearly have some of the better omnichannel technology. So can you comment on the kind of inbounds you’re getting from your merchants to help them with your tech and omnichannel? And what does that mean for market share for Square versus the industry on the other side of it?
Amrita Ahuja: Hey there. I’ll start us off on what we’re seeing to start and then Jack can jump in on where we believe our ecosystem is differentiated. So what we’re seeing so far in terms of the diversity of our ecosystem, because you’re right, we serve a variety of verticals, we serve across a number of geographies, some with shelter-in-place measures, most with shelter-in-place measures and some that are easing both domestically and internationally, and we serve a variety of products across our ecosystem. So, let me try to tease apart bit of what we’re seeing across all of that. At the aggregate level, what we saw in the back half of March and then through April was Seller GPV down 39% year-over-year, but it’s important to tease apart the nuances when you look on a week-by-week basis. The last week of March and the first half of April was down about 45% year-over-year. In the back half of April, we’ve seen improvement that has rebounded above that blended 39% year-over-year number. We believe it’s driven by three main factors. First, existing sellers adapting to contactless commerce and we’ll talk through some of the products that we have that have really served our sellers in this time and enabled them to stay open and interacting with their buyers. We’ve seen new sellers join our platform in this time because of the differentiated aspects of our ecosystem. And we’ve seen the impact of both the timing of Easter and the potential impact from the government stimulus programs, which have really started taking effect in mid-April. From a commerce type perspective, which really speaks to the breadth of our ecosystem, we have seen positive year-over-year growth in our card-not-present products as sellers have adapted to contactless commerce solutions. And now card-not-present products, which used to account for about a third of our volumes, now account for well over 50% of our GPV in April. Some of the key outperformance to point out here include the online store, which since the launch of curbside pickup and Seller power delivery, I mentioned, our weekly GPV on the online store is about 5X what we had seen earlier in Q1. As sellers are shifting their approach to contactless options, additionally, virtual terminal and invoices both achieved positive year-over-year growth, which may be partly related to the less impact we’ve seen in the services vertical, which really makes use of that product. From a market standpoint or a geographic standpoint, we’ve seen a variety of outcomes across international markets, Australia interestingly, which has had the most success in reducing COVID cases is our first market, was our first market to return to positive year-over-year growth in the past 10 days that we’ve seen growth rates stabilize in that positive range. And we have also seen, as I mentioned, in some of the states in the U.S. that in late April started easing shelter-in-place restrictions, early data that indicates a stronger uplift in those states versus the states with shelter-in-place measures in place. We only have a week of data so far and obviously there is a lot to look at here, a lot of considerations around health metrics and otherwise. But this is an area that we will continue to monitor. Across the diversity of our Seller base, and as you noted, we serve sellers across every vertical, millions of businesses and widespread across the U.S. in particular. We’ve seen impacts from COVID-19 in a number of different ways. While all industries have experienced year-over-year declines in GPV, the services vertical, as I mentioned, like home and repair and professional services has been the most resilient. And we’ve seen verticals that have been hard hit like food and beverage and retail make use of those omnichannel products that I was mentioning earlier. By seller size, so maybe my final point before Jack chimes in, by seller size all five segments were impacted. Micro sellers’ growth declines are now more comparable to larger sellers, but what you see with micros is both higher churn and higher same store sales growth. So still, nuance across the system, but serve a diversity across verticals, geographies and products.
Jack Dorsey: Hey, Darrin. Hope you’re well. Yes. So, we are seeing a lot of opportunity here. We are seeing sellers switch to Square from our competitors because of the omnichannel ecosystem. In terms of inbound, so the first and foremost was just how do I run my business online, and we were able to quickly help people shift. And a lot of these sellers wanted to get online and wanted to sell online, but just didn’t make the time to do so. So this was kind of a forcing function to show them all the benefits of being online. And I think what that ultimately does is they will have a lot more attention online as the offline comes back and be much stronger businesses because of it, which is awesome. We’ve also seen some calls from very large sellers, which have increased since March. It’s been up over 30%. And they are coming to us because of the omnichannel ecosystem as well. We saw just one example. We had a chain of breweries which was struggling to adapt with the pandemic. And they came to us to install their online business with the competitor. Instead, we were able to get them up and running much, much faster. So they switched everything to us. So it’s really important to emphasize that as we come out of this, we do believe that a lot of sellers are going to get creative and they’re not just going to be in the retail category or in the restaurants category or in the services category, they’re going to merge these things, and Square is the only one out there that actually covers all the verticals with all the critical tools to actually be creative and serve your customers in new ways. So we’re seeing larger sellers at scale. We’re seeing our current customers and we’re seeing new customers who see this omnichannel offering and want to go with us because we’re easier. And I do believe that the speed at which we’re able to move and the volume we are able to move with the PPP program for our sellers versus the rest of the financial institutions will be a net positive for us in terms of a goodwill halo, attracting a lot of sellers our way because there are very, very rich seller networks of sellers asking another seller what tools to use and why. What’s the company like. What have they done well for you in the past and what have they done poorly. So I think how we’ve handled our sellers and supported them throughout this time will be a huge win for us in terms of retaining, but also newer sellers as well.
Amrita Ahuja: And just to add a final point to that. Some of the marketing results that we’re seeing that I mentioned earlier are showing that those new weekly seller cohorts that we’re attracting since the middle of March are larger both in aggregate across the cohort and on an individual seller-by-seller basis versus pre-COVID levels, which really shows to underscore the point Jack was making that we believe we’re a differentiated ecosystem that’s attracting not only larger sellers, but broader sizes of cohorts of sellers in this very dynamic time.
Darrin Peller: All right, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Misuraca from Red White & Que. Your line is open.
Dan Misuraca: Hi. I’m a Square seller with Red White & Que Smokehouse here in Kearny, New Jersey. Regarding Inventory, Square Online Store shows sold out on the website once an item inventory hits zero. But for business like ours, we have a variable amount each day. As more quick service restaurants like us, Red White & Que shifts to Square Online Store during the COVID-19, we’re seeing more for a flexible inventory management system. Are there plans to build out features like this for quick service restaurants using Square Online Store?
Jack Dorsey: Yes. Hey Dan, this is Jack. Thanks for using Square, and hope you’re staying safe. This is something we’re actively working on. Inventory is a big focus area for us and we accelerated a bunch of our roadmap in order to support curbside pickup and delivery. And we need to make sure that we’re adding the option to organize orders by fulfillment channel out of the site on mobile without the app, modified delivery zones. So we’re getting a ton of feedback in this time on what’s working and what’s not working in regards to inventory and generally with the system as we’ve shifted to this new world, and we’re working as fast as we can on it. So, I appreciate the feedback and we’re on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.
Lisa Ellis: Good afternoon. Good to hear you guys’ voices. My question is on related to Cash App and the transaction activity you’re seeing there. Last week Visa reported that their U.S. debit volumes were actually trending positive low-single-digits in late April due to some of the stimulus spending. Are you seeing similar trends like that on the Cash Card? And then looking forward, do you expect Cash Card volumes to remain pretty resilient because they’re tied to non-discretionary spending or how are you thinking about the employment impact there? Are a lot of the Cash App users some of the folks that unfortunately we’re seeing unemployed currently. What is your outlook in general for the transaction activity on Cash Card? Thank you.
Amrita Ahuja: Hey, Lisa. I’ll start us off. Thanks for the question. April was a strong month, as you heard for Cash App overall. And including for Cash Card where we saw Cash Card’s highest monthly total for both orders and for volumes of spend across the Cash Card. Following the deceleration that we saw in late March, growth troughed around the end of March and spend began to rebound in early April even before the stimulus payments, which roughly came in about mid-April. Ahead of the government stimulus programs, customers explored direct deposit functionality and engaged with the app. We saw significant increase in Cash Card orders and a growth in active across the active base for Cash Card. And that was prior to the second IRS portal release on April 15. As the stimulus payments were disbursed, we saw a material increase in volumes per card active as Cash App serves really a critical need here by helping customers access and use their funds rapidly. The uplift in weekly spend has continued in the second half of April, although still below pre-COVID levels. And we’re seeing the spending behavior on Cash Card shift toward more card-not-present and online commerce, as you can understand, given shelter-in-place measures. We’re also seeing elevated non-discretionary spend; grocers, health and wellness, retail away from bars, restaurants, entertainment, transportation that we would have seen pre-COVID. And we believe the unique aspect that we have here with the Boost program has positioned us to help individuals where we’re using our ecosystem here to help benefit our customers and actively rotating our Boost awards offered to specific merchants and categories including things like grocery, pharmacies and Dollar stores. In terms of the broader question about unemployment, we are very watchful here and we want to see what normalized spending looks like post the stimulus efforts. So it’s probably too early for us to say, but we are very encouraged both in the growth of the base of users across Cash App and Cash Card and the depth of the engagement that we’ve seen through products like direct deposit in the last weeks and months.
Lisa Ellis: Super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Timothy Chiodo: Thank you for taking my question. Also related Cash App and a little bit of a follow-up there on direct deposit. So yes, the Cash App stats across the board were pretty impressive, especially I think the direct deposit was really a standout. The shareholder letter shows direct deposit active users up more than – it looks like more than 2X month-over-month into April and mentioned the stimulus checks being a big driver there of the direct deposit activity. But what can you tell us about these users in terms of perhaps their propensity to continue to use direct deposit with their paychecks beyond the stimulus? And then as somewhat of a follow-up there. What are some of the things in general that Cash App either has already done or is planning to do to help continue that strong adoption of a primary account usage? I did notice that you mentioned the eligibility increased from about 3 million to 14 million in terms of direct deposit, so that sounds like a pretty good start.
Jack Dorsey: Yes. Thanks, Tim. I hope you’re well. We do believe direct deposit is a huge opportunity. And as we said in the opening, direct deposit customers are some of the most engaged on the platform. And they typically carry much higher balances and use more of our products like bitcoin and equities in addition to Cash Card and peer-to-peer. We saw two significant bumps recently. Customers that received their tax refunds and depositor paychecks used our ecosystem a whole lot more and we saw an increase in P2P volumes and Cash Card spend in late February and also in late March. And then in April, obviously, the government stimulus provided us an opportunity to help folks receive their money much, much faster. And our teams did work, as we mentioned, with our partner banks to expand the 3 million direct deposit accounts we had in February to 14 million. We also made sure that the interface is very clear. So, when you click into the tab that is actually where the money is stored, you should see your direct deposit routing number right away. So just putting it upfront so that people know that this is a tool that can be used for tax, for your stimulus, for your paycheck at your job is critical. And that does lead to people seeing Cash App ultimately as a primary account, not needing to go to a bank branch regarding to going to the App Store, signing up and they are in business. And it’s not just around peer-to-peer and storing money and using on the card, but the people, who are using that money to buy equities, using that to invest in product and also buy bitcoin has been pretty incredible. So, this is part of the reason why we think the ecosystem strategy is so strong. We’re not just a peer-to-peer app. We’re not just a stock purchasing app. We’re not just a bitcoin app. We have everything in one. And everything that is interesting in terms of how I think about my own personal finances and spend my money is all in one simple straightforward app that we will continue to make better and add more adjacent features that complement some of these critical needs that people are telling us they have.
Amrita Ahuja: And Tim, just to add a couple metrics to this topic; from March to April, we saw direct deposit volumes grow by 3X. From March to April, we saw new direct deposit transacting active grow by 4X. And from March to April, we saw our stored funds grow from $945 million across the base of Cash App users to over $1.3 billion. So clearly, this is a product that’s resonated. And we believe we’re in a transformational moment right now, where new commerce standards, new banking habits, new ways of conducting financial services and commerce are taking shape. And Cash App, along with our Seller business has an opportunity to serve our customers uniquely in this moment. So, while I think it’s early for us to say what happens or what changes with the curve of direct deposit in the future, this is a key priority for us and encouraging signs that we’ve seen in the month of April here.
Timothy Chiodo: Great. Thanks a lot, definitely noted on the metrics, the change to the interface and more features to come. So, thanks a lot.
Jack Dorsey: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Beck from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Josh Beck: Yes. Thank you for taking the question, and really impressive work that you’ve done for your consumers and sellers. I wanted to ask a higher level question on Cash App. When you look at the newer customers that you’ve may be pulled in, in the last month or so, is it expanding the audience in addressable market in any ways? And obviously, I had some really good stats on the online store, any sense to give us how many sellers have actually lit up that product that would be really helpful? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey: Thanks, Josh. I do believe that it is expanding the audience pretty dramatically. Cash App has been something really special for us and that it has a lot of association with a pretty strong culture. It’s not seen as just a traditional financial app, it’s seen as part of the culture in many ways and we’re seeing that play out, especially now during COVID-19. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, like all the donating that’s happening on social media, the fundraising, the tipping to artists and musicians, this is all pretty new, and we’re looking at this closely and we’re taking the opportunities to form partnerships that there are some, like we announced a partnership with Spotify, which lets listeners contribute and send money to artists that post their cashtag on their artist page. And more than 25,000 artists have already linked their Cash App account with Spotify. And we saw more than 100,000 tips in the first week since the launch. Another big area is gamers. We’re seeing a lot of activity in regards to Cash App on Twitch. In the first quarter, we launched our Twitch channel and we’ve grown our follower account to over 180,000. But what’s interesting about this is like there’s a lot of similarities between what we’re seeing around music and also gaming and how Cash App is being used in both. So, we have reached a very mainstream influential audience. And because of the simplicity, because of how we handle the stimulus check and because of everything that you can do within the app inclusive of buying stocks and bitcoin and the Cash Card, we think we’ll benefit and draft off a lot of trust, a lot of love for what it offers and what it can do. And word of mouth is definitely our friend here. So, we consistently see the Cash App in the top 10 of the App Stores and consistently, see it rise as new people broadcast are in use of it. So, there is a very nice viral loop that is inherent in the system that continues to compound and grow favorably. On the second question, how many sellers have used the Square Online Store; Amrita, do you want to take this?
Amrita Ahuja: Sure. I’ll hit that one and maybe, just one final point before I do that on the cash opportunity. If you remember, Josh, we released some slides in late March related to addressable market across both our Cash App ecosystem and the Seller ecosystem. Cash App ecosystem addresses over 100 million people in the U.S. with a target age of between 15 and 39, which represents $60 billion of opportunity across just the product areas that we serve today. So, we envision a really significant runway ahead for Cash App. And Cash App in the month of April at various points was in the top five of the iOS App Store in terms of downloaded apps only behind some chat apps. So, clearly resonating, as Jack said, in this sort of cultural moment that we’re in. Turning to your second question on Square Online Store, we can speak about Square Online Store, and then let’s level up and talk about broader our CNP offerings, our card-not-present offerings. So, Online Store, we haven’t provided a usage number in terms of active sellers, but on a weekly GPV basis up 5X since mid-March, pre-COVID effectively. And our most recent weekly GPV run rate was at $59 million or $3 billion on an annualized basis. And now the daily sign-ups that we’re seeing to Square Online Store are higher in number than what our typical sign-ups would have been for the point-of-sale app pre-COVID. So clearly, resonating and resonating for new sellers as well as existing sellers. But again, I would think about our broader omnichannel strategy rather than just focusing on the online store. And more broadly, our card-not-present products, as I mentioned earlier, now over 50% of our volumes versus a third of our volumes prior to COVID. And that spend is not just for online store, but invoices, virtual terminal, parts of our developer platform with the e-commerce API, and this has been an area of strength for us with positive GPV growth year-over-year in the month of April.
Josh Beck: Very helpful, Jack and Amrita. Thanks so much.
Amrita Ahuja: Thanks, Josh.
Jack Dorsey: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Cathy on for Jason. Thanks for taking my question. And I just wanted to get an update on Seller churn and whether you found specific programs or initiatives with sellers to be particularly effective? And perhaps, if you have any new products or initiatives coming maybe to complement some of the existing ones you already have? Thank you.
Amrita Ahuja: I can maybe, start us off on this one. So, in terms of churn, it’s typically a variable figure for us given the large portion of micro-sellers that we serve, who may be seasonable – seasonal. So, given the noise that we see today and how early trends are shaping up, the main indicator I’d point you towards, would be change in gross profit or change in GPV growth, which as noted for the Seller business is in that minus 35% or minus 39% range for the month of April. We’ve noted earlier on the call that the back half of April, we’ve seen improving trends based on existing sellers transitioning to new forms of commerce, based on new sellers coming in, based on stimulus efforts. We’ve also noted that certain areas with easing shelter in place measures we’ve seen further improvement and what we’ve seen in terms of number of unique cards and number of unique sellers in the back half of April has also improved, which to us, indicates that we have sellers, who are able to reopen their business in the back half of April. So, those are kind of the trends that we’ve seen around churn. In terms of the key things that we can do for our sellers, I think a lot of them have been noted on this call. Sellers are looking for omnichannel solutions that enable them to interact with their buyers in new formats, whether that’s with commerce, online, invoices, et cetera. They’re also looking for cash flow and opportunities to bridge them in this really disruptive time. And the PPP program, where we helped enable over $0.5 billion in loans in the past week, has also gone a long way to supporting our sellers and speaks to the strength of the ecosystem that we were able to move quickly and get this product up and running in just a few short weeks. Within each of these products, you see features that are working towards supporting our sellers, whether it’s pre-populating applications in the PPP program for payroll sellers or it’s the order and pickup delivery product that was launched in the span of a few short weeks as well as on the cash business, where the Sprint towards enabling government stimulus and direct deposit accounts, our teams are working very, very hard. No boondoggles happening at the company right now. Our teams are working very, very hard to enable new products, and features across supporting our sellers and individuals.
Jack Dorsey: Kathy, this is also one of the areas, where the ecosystem strategy makes us a lot stronger. A seller may churn out of one product, but still be using two others or three others from us. So, they’re not churning out with the whole company, and as we add more of those critical functions and tools that gets even more and more durable. So, a lot of the reason why behind the ecosystem strategy is exactly this. But like everyone else, we’re learning as quickly as possible in partnership with our sellers on what’s working during this time, what they need, how they think about rebounding as more things reopen and all those learnings will be distilled into products and features going forward. And we’re doing that with our current customers, our small customers and even our larger customers, who are rediscovering new ways and discovering our other tools like Ben & Jerry’s is a good example of this. These are point-of-sale across 200 retail shops and needed to pivot to online. So, we showed – we demoed the Square Online Store and they’re rolling it out nationwide over the coming weeks. So, if you’re very small or very large, what we think, helps the most with retaining is making sure that people see our full suite of services and gain value out of them.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the answer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Friedman  from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good to hear your voices. That Ben & Jerry’s making me hungry. I just want to ask, a part of the investment operating narrative has been about the cross-selling of Seller and Cash App. And I was just wondering in light of the current business environment, how that may have affected your thinking on the cross-selling of Cash and Seller ecosystems? You had a lot of good use cases, Jack, in your prepared remarks. So, is that something that you’re moving forward in terms of your kind of time horizon? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey: Yes. Great question, Jamie. So, we are moving forward. We did have to reprioritize our roadmap just to handle some of the issues that we’re presently seeing and challenges we’re seeing with our sellers and Cash App customers due to COVID. But we do believe that there is a lot of real strength that comes from connecting the two ecosystems. They’re amazing independently, but as we look for those connection points whether they’d be a boost to local sellers, what we’ve done with our payroll product and paying employees with Cash App so they could access their funds immediately. So, there’s a number of those that we think are really interesting and potentially really impactful. So, we wanted to make sure that we’re handling the present challenge first, but we’re definitely not taking our eyes off the ball in terms of how we connect these two down the line.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Jack Dorsey: Thank you.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Ramsey El Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Ben on for Ramsey, and thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, kind of wanted to follow-up on some of the earlier questions about the change in the product roadmap. I noticed international revenue had grown pretty nicely in the quarter. And I guess, first, is that just due to a kind of a broader suite of products now being rolled out in all the countries? But more specifically, the question I’m kind of wondering is that what are the opportunities you see being pushed out? And kind of how does your roadmap specifically there change with everything going on right now?
Amrita Ahuja: Maybe, I can kick us off with what we’ve seen from an international perspective in the first quarter and in April. From an April perspective, international GCV was down 20%, which was a deceleration versus prior COVID levels. From a first quarter perspective, GAAP international revenue was up 51%. So, strong growth for us and consistent with what we had seen in the prior couple of quarters, where we had seen outperformance as our products are resonating internationally. In terms of breaking down some of those trends related to COVID that we’ve seen in April, as I mentioned earlier, in April, in Australia, we’re now seeing positive year-over-year growth. From a UK perspective, we’re seeing modest declines, and Japan and Canada are still down year-over-year, but seeing improvement as well. So, very consistent with the broader narrative that we’ve been sharing on this call so far from a COVID impact perspective. And obviously, our products continue to resonate there from an omnichannel perspective internationally as they do in the U.S.
Jack Dorsey: Yes. And just to follow-up, we’re not going to take our focus off growing outside of the United States; we’re making sure that our ecosystem is sound and comprehensive outside the United States. We have done a lot of good work over the past few quarters, but there’s a lot more to do. And we – the same needs that we see during this time in the U.S. with COVID we’re seeing globally as well and we want to make sure that the thing that sets us apart is this ecosystem and it helps us set us apart, not just in the United States, but everywhere. And we’ve learned a ton from the U.S. on how various products took off, and that helps our sequencing around these roadmaps. So, we can be more sure of the impact as we put the work into actually do the work to launch.
