"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Global Payments Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will open the lines for questions and answers.  And as a reminder, today’s conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.
Winnie Smith: Good morning, and welcome to Global Payments fourth quarter and full-year 2020 conference call. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today’s conference call contain forward-looking statements about expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impacts of COVID-19 and economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectation. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.
Jeff Sloan: Thanks, Winnie. We delivered fourth quarter and full-year results that exceeded our expectations because of our focus on technology enablement, coupled with ongoing excellence and execution. Our fourth quarter results demonstrated continued sequential improvement despite the impact of a more challenging macroeconomic environment in a number of our markets for much of the period. None of this would have been possible without the dedication of our exceptional team members during this difficult time. And we thank them for their commitment to our customers, to each other and to our communities. We are very pleased to have delivered substantial margin improvement for the fourth quarter, while also setting aside funds to pay partial cash bonuses to our non-executive team members. Because of the actions we took early in the pandemic and our consistency and execution, we were able to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter, positioning us well heading into 2021. We believe that we exited 2020 in a better position than we entered. We also accomplished a great deal over the last 12 months. Specifically, we signed Truist Financial Corporation, the sixth largest commercial bank in the United States, a competitive win twice over; entered a new collaboration with AWS, our preferred provider of issuer cloud services, to launch a unique go-to-market distribution strategy, coupled with transformative cloud-native technologies; expanded and extended our partnership with CaixaBank on increasing ownership of our joint venture and executing a new referral agreement through 2040; renewed agreements with a number of the most complex and sophisticated financial institutions globally, including TD Bank in North America, HSBC in Europe and CIBC in Canada; assisted in the rapid distribution of more than $2.5 billion in stimulus funds for our Netspend customers days faster than other financial technology participants; and announced today a new partnership with Google to deliver innovative and seamless digital services to all manner of merchants worldwide.
Cameron Bready: Thanks, Jeff. We are delighted to announce today our new multiyear strategic partnership with Google that we expect will meaningfully enhance our ability to deliver new, innovative cloud-based products and capabilities, advance our technology-enabled distribution strategy, and deliver significant operational efficiencies, while improving speed-to-market and the scalability of our Merchant Solutions business. This exciting partnership has a number of facets that collectively serve to further distinguish our digital capabilities worldwide. First, together, we will collaborate on product development and innovation to enhance and differentiate the suite of cloud-based solutions available to our Merchant customers. These distinctive solutions will create stickier and longer-term customer relationships, building on our competitive advantages. As just one example of the types of enhanced capabilities we will offer together, Google’s Business Services, including Google My Business, Workspace and Ads, will be integrated with Global Payments leading value-added software and payments ecosystem, creating a single destination and seamless digital experience for the full spectrum of solutions that merchants need to run and grow their businesses globally. Merchant customers will be able to digitally access the industry’s most robust value stack of SaaS offerings, including point of sale, omni-channel ordering and integrated payments, advertising, data and analytics, email marketing, online presence and reputation management, and loyalty and gift card solutions, as well as capital access and payroll and human capital management solutions. These products will be delivered through Global Payment cloud-native operating environment, driving better customer engagement and ease of use.
Paul Todd: Thanks, Cameron. Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2020 exceeded our post COVID-19 expectations and highlights our outstanding execution and the resiliency of our business model. For the full-year, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $6.75 billion, down 5% compared to 2019 on a combined basis. Importantly, our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points on a combined basis to 39.7%, as we benefited from the broad expense actions we implemented to address the impact of the pandemic and the realization of cost synergies related to the merger, which continue to track ahead of plan. It is worth highlighting that our full-year adjusted operating margin performance was largely consistent with the guidance we gave at the start of 2020 and prior to the pandemic. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $6.40, an increase of 3% over 2019. We are extremely pleased that we were able to grow our bottom line in 2020, enabled by continued execution on our differentiated strategy and our unwavering focus on all things within our control despite the impacts of COVID-19 on the worldwide economy. Moving to the fourth quarter, adjusted net revenue was $1.75 billion, a 3% decline relative to 2019, as underlying trends in our business continued to recover from third quarter levels. Adjusted operating margin was 41.5%, a 320 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.80 for the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year period, an impressive outcome that highlights the durability of our model and momentum we have heading into 2021. Taking a closer look at our performance by segment, Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, a 4% decline from the prior year, which marked a 200 basis point improvement from the third quarter. Notably, we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.5% in this segment, an increase of 250 basis points from 2019, as our cost initiatives, expense synergies and the underlying strength of our business mix more than offset top line headwinds from the macro environment. Our technology-enabled portfolio continues to prove relatively resilient, with several of our businesses delivering year-over-year growth again this quarter. Specifically, worldwide omni-channel volume growth, excluding T&E, accelerated to the high-teens, as our value proposition, including our unified commerce platform or UCP continues to resonate with customers. Additionally, Global Payments Integrated delivered adjusted net revenue growth for a second consecutive quarter. The leading scale and scope of our Integrated ecosystem across more vertical market markets and more geographies than our peers also enabled another record year for new partner production. As for our own software portfolio, AdvancedMD remained a bright spot and once again produced strong double-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the quarter and achieved a record bookings year in 2020. Indeed, booking trends across our vertical markets portfolio remains solid, providing us with a positive tailwind heading into 2021. We are also pleased that our U.S. relationship-led business saw adjusted net revenue returned to slight growth for the fourth quarter, enabled by the innovative technology and software solutions we are delivering in this channel. And despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment in several of our international markets this period, demand for our differentiated capabilities outside of the U.S. remains strong, as our solutions are well aligned with shifting customer needs coming out of the pandemic. Moving to Issuer Solutions, we delivered $457 million in adjusted net revenue for the fourth quarter, which was essentially flat to the prior year period. Transaction volumes recovered further, while traditional accounts on file continued to grow, setting a new record. Additionally, our bundled pricing model, including value-added products and services, also benefited performance. Excluding our commercial card business, which represents approximately 20% of our Issuer portfolio and is being impacted by the slow recovery in corporate travel, this segment delivered low single-digit growth for the quarter. Notably, this business achieved record adjusted operating income, and adjusted segment operating margin expanded 450 basis points from the prior year, also reaching a new record of 44.7%, as we continue to benefit from our efforts to drive efficiencies in the business. As Jeff highlighted, our Issuer team successfully signed 5 long-term contract extension and 1 new contract in the quarter. Finally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $205 million, a record fourth quarter result, representing growth of 3% from the prior year. Gross dollar volume increased more than 5% for the quarter, a result including little impact from the late December incremental stimulus, which we expect to primarily benefit us in Q1. We are particularly pleased with trends with our DDA products which includes an acceleration in active account growth of 29% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for this segment improved 260 basis points to 24.1%, as we benefited from our efforts to drive greater operational efficiencies as well as favorable revenue mix dynamics toward higher-margin channels. The solid performance we delivered across our segments highlights the powerful combination of Global Payments and TSYS, which has provided us with multiple levers to mitigate the headwinds we have faced from the pandemic. We made great progress on our integration during the crisis, which I mentioned, continues to track ahead of plan. As a result, we are pleased to again raise our estimate for annual run rate expense synergies from the merger to at least $400 million within 3 years, up from the previous estimate of $375 million. This marks the fourth time we have increased our cost synergy expectations. Additionally, our early success in leveraging our complementary products and capabilities worldwide also gives us the confidence to increase our expectation for annual run rate synergies, again, to $150 million, up from our previous forecast of $125 million. From a cash flow standpoint, we generated adjusted free cash flow of roughly $780 million for the quarter and approximately $2 billion for the year. These are both records for us. This is after reinvesting $107 million of CapEx for the quarter and $436 million for the year. As you may recall, we indicated we expected to invest between $400 million and $500 million of CapEx back into the business following the onset of the pandemic. Consistent with our announcement on our last call, we are also pleased to have now returned to our traditional capital allocation priorities. And during the quarter, we purchased 1.2 million of our shares for approximately $230 million. Our balance sheet is extremely healthy. And we ended 2020 with roughly $3 billion of liquidity and a leverage position of roughly 2.6x on a net debt basis. Further, our Board of Directors has again approved an increase through our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. As part of this program, we intend to execute an accelerated share repurchase program for $500 million in the coming days. Turning to our outlook for 2021, based on our current expectations for continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, we expect adjusted net revenue to range from $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, reflecting growth of 11% to 13% over 2020. This outlook is consistent with the high end of our long-term target of high single-digit to low double-digit growth, and it is also reflects the benefit of the year-on-year comparisons due to the pandemic. Considering this top line forecast, we would expect to deliver normalized adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 450 basis points, given the natural operating leverage in our business and expense synergy actions related to the TSYS merger. However, this will be partially offset by the reinstatement of certain expenses that were temporarily reduced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for most of 2020. Therefore, we are currently forecasting adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 250 basis points compared to 2020 levels on a net basis. To provide some color at the segment level, we expect adjusted net revenue growth for our Merchant Solutions segment to be in the mid to high teens, which assumes the current pace of recovery continues worldwide. We expect underlying trends in our issuing business to be in the mid to high single-digit growth range and above our mid-single-digit growth target. These trends should be normalized for two distinct and relatively equal sized headwinds. First, we are not anticipating a recovery in our commercial card business as we expect corporate travel to remain depressed throughout 2021. Second, we will be absorbing the impact of a portfolio sale by one of our customers, which will impact us for the remainder of the year. Taking these two items into account, we are forecasting our issuing business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the low single-digit range for the full-year. Lastly, we expect underlying trends in our business and consumer segment to be consistent with our long-term expectations of mid to high single-digit growth. This outlook reflects the expected benefits of the recent stimulus announced at the end of December, but it does not assume any additional stimulus. Adjusting for the impact of the larger 2020 CARES Act stimulus on comparative results for 2021 we are forecasting adjusted net revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits for this segment. Regarding segment margins, we expect up to 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement for the total company, to be driven largely by Merchant Solutions, while we expect Issuer and Business and Consumer to deliver normalized margin expansion consistent with the underlying leverage profile of these businesses. This follows a 500 and 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion delivered by Issuer and Business and Consumer respectively in 2020. Lastly, I would highlight that from a quarterly phasing perspective, we will not lap the initial impact of the pandemic until mid-March. Therefore, we will have pandemic affected first quarter comparisons, resulting in more muted growth characteristics early in 2021, with the opposite effect occurring in the second quarter, before returning to more normalized rates of growth in the back half of the year. Our outlook is for adjusted net revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth for each quarter of 2021. Moving to a couple of non-operating items, we currently expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in 2021 relative to 2020, while we anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be relatively consistent with last year and expect our capital expenditures for 2021 to be in the $500 million to $600 million range. Putting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full-year in a range of $7.75 to $8.05, reflecting growth of 21% to 26% over 2020. This is consistent with the adjusted earnings per share target of roughly $8 that we provided on our third quarter call despite the incremental adverse impact of additional lockdowns and social distancing protocols in a number of our markets since late October. In summary, our 2021 guidance assumes an improving economy for the first-half of the year and a stronger second-half of the year, with continued progress toward normalization. We are pleased with how well we are positioned as we enter 2021. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.
Jeff Sloan: Thanks, Paul. I am very proud of all that we accomplished in 2020. This would have been a remarkable year of milestones regardless of the macroeconomic environment, but is all the more notable in the face of a 100-year pandemic. Competitively, 2020 was a year of firing on all cylinders for our company. Across our businesses, we took meaningful market share and advanced the volt further down the field despite all the challenges front of us. We don’t need to wait to see a more benign macro to grow. We didn’t spend the past year waiting for a better day. Our resilience is self-evident. The technology investments we made over the last 7 plus years, our distinctive strategy and execution consistency has served us well and we significantly expanded our competitive moat as a result during the crisis. While hurdles undoubtedly remain, we would not trade positions with anyone heading into 2021. Winnie?
Winnie Smith: Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I would like to ask everyone to limit your question to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.
Operator: Thank you.  The first question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Bryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the Google relationship, does it change the pricing to the Merchant at all? Do they see different fees as a result of the partnership or do they get a lot of these benefits as part of the package?
Cameron Bready: Hey, Bryan, it’s Cameron. Good morning. I will start with that and then ask Jeff or Paul to jump in if they would like to. So basically, what we are really trying to do is create an even more differentiated portal offering to our customer base by enhancing our existing value-added services with Google products and capabilities that exist in the market today. And then further as we co-develop and innovate new products with Google, we will obviously look to layer those into the portal environment as well. The nice thing about portal environment is completely self-select. Our customers can choose what products and solutions that they need to run and grow their business and they will be able to effectively determine the pricing outcome that they desire based on their need for products and services. So like anything else we do, there will be different levels of availability to customers from lower end, very basic to mid-market, to higher end complete sets that will have different price points associated with them. But end of the day, the idea is our customers have the opportunity to self-select the product, services, capabilities and solutions they need to run and grow their businesses more effectively. And by working with Google, we expect to be able to innovate new products and capabilities that will be distinctive in the marketplace for them.
Bryan Keane: Got it. Helpful. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask on the Merchant side, I think you talked about mid to high-teens growth. Can you give us any help kind of by segment thinking about relationship software? Obviously, that probably recovers stronger and integrated. Just by the pieces, maybe what those growth rates might look like to get to that mid to high-teens growth? Thanks. 
Cameron Bready: Yes. Sure, Bryan. It’s Cameron. Maybe I’ll start with just a little commentary about the expectations for the business and I’ll let Paul jump in with a few more of the details. So I would say if you look at the business overall, given that North America represents about 70% of the Merchant business globally, obviously, it’s going to drive the lion’s share of the outcome for the entire segment for the full-year. And I would say we are looking for pretty good recoveries, obviously, in the payments and payroll business as well as the integrated business in the U.S. So I would say both of those would be towards the higher end of that targeted expectation that we have for the merchant business in aggregate. And as the vertical markets that we participate in continue to recover as well, we would expect our vertical market business to be towards the higher end of that range also just given, obviously, the impacts on 2020 for that business as well as a strong new sales performance that we saw in 2020 giving us good momentum kind of heading into 2021 as we start to lap the impacts of the pandemic. I think, Europe, our expectations are a little more modest. They’re probably in that kind of mid-teens range, just given some of the incremental impacts of new shutdowns and restrictions in the first part of the year in Europe. And maybe just a slightly more benign expectation around the recovery environment in Europe, particularly as it relates to cross-border throughout the course of 2021. And then I would say Asia has recovered reasonably well heading into the year. And I think we have pretty good expectations that Asia gets back to a fairly strong growth rate in the year towards, again, the high end of that guidance range overall for 2021. So I think when you put it all together, we feel good about the mix of businesses we have and the overall expectation for mid to high-teens growth for the full-year. I would tell you, Bryan, that basically assumes kind of an ongoing gradual recovery from where we are today. We’ve seen results in January that are better than December. And we expect the recovery to continue to grind higher through the balance of the year. Such that by the time we’re exiting ‘21, we expect domestic volumes to be more normalized. And obviously, we think cross-border is going to continue to lag slightly kind of heading into 2022. And that’s consistent with the commercial card commentary that Paul provided in his script. So we are not expecting a heroic recovery as we think about the outlook for 2021. We expect a gradual recovery kind of throughout the year. We know it won’t be linear. There’ll be puts and takes as we continue to progress throughout the year. But by and large, expect a continued gradual recovery, and that’s really what supports the overall Merchant expectation for the year. Paul, I don’t know if you would add anything to that.
Paul Todd: Yes. The only thing I would add, I think you covered it. It would just be the quarterly phasing of that, Bryan. I kind of referenced that in the script. But obviously, in the first quarter, we have really a pre-pandemic affected comparison that kind of lends sort of more muted growth there. And the second quarter is just the opposite. Those two kind of blend out to that mid to high rate that we’re talking about. And then the last half of the year is pretty consistent with that mid to high rate. So I think that gives a little more color on the quarterly pay thing.
Jeff Sloan: Yes. And the only other thing I would add to that, Bryan, is we don’t need a heroic recovery or perfection you’re going to get to the higher end of the range. So obviously, there’s a lot of uncertainty heading into the year, and I think our guidance accommodates that. But we don’t need perfection and some sort of heroic recovery where everything is kind of back to normal by midyear for us to get to the higher end of the range that we put forward today.
Bryan Keane: Got it. Very helpful comments. Thanks, guys.
Jeff Sloan: Thanks, Bryan.
Operator: And our next question from Timothy Chiodo of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Timothy Chiodo: Thanks a lot for taking the questions. So you mentioned this in the Google press release and then also Cameron in the prepared remarks around the distribution of not just payments acceptance, but also loyalty, gift card, payroll, capital access was mentioned and other financial services. Maybe you could talk a little bit more broadly about not only the opportunity within the Google relationship, but also how much runway there might be for embedding these offerings with your 4,000 other software platforms and partners within the global integrated Global Payments integrated business?
Cameron Bready: Yes. It’s a really good question. So there is really two elements of that. There’s one, obviously, the co-sell relationship that we’ll have with Google as it relates to our go-to-market strategy going forward. And obviously, being able to work with Google Cloud, co-sell solutions with them, having them refer business into us from a payment standpoint creates a strong new technology-enabled distribution stream that really, I think, augments and complements our existing go-to-market strategies very nicely. So we’re delighted about that and think there’s a lot that we can do together with Google to drive new revenue growth in the business through this cross-sell relationship. And then reflecting back a little bit on the comments that I made to Bryan’s question, if you think about the business, these solutions will be delivered through our cloud-based digital portal that is in operation today and running in Google Cloud today. So the idea is as we continue to integrate new products and solutions and services into our digital portal, they’ll be available to our entire merchant base regardless of what distribution and channel that merchant customer comes to us. So since it’s all consolidated on the back end, those merchant customers will have the ability to access all of those value-added solutions and capabilities, whether or not they are a traditional relationship-led customer coming through us through that channel or they are an integrated customer coming through us through an ISV relationship. And we think that’s unique and distinctive to Global Payments, our ability to integrate those solutions and make them available through a digital portal to the entire suite of customers that we serve around the globe.
Timothy Chiodo: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is open.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Congrats, Jeff, Cameron and Paul. You guys have been quite big in a lot of investments and announcements to absorb here. It’s good to see. I guess one question I had, obviously, heading into ‘21 a lot of moving parts that you addressed on the prepared remarks. But if you don’t mind, could you kind of, in one place, kind of go through the cadence of how you expect overall segment revenue and profits to perform over the course of the year by segment, particularly thinking of comps, synergy, unwind of early pandemic cost, things like that?
Paul Todd: Sure, Ashwin. We kind of hit on it a little bit on the merchant side in the earlier question around kind of that phasing and that same kind of concept kind of plays through to a large degree with other segments, particularly as it relates to the pre-pandemic comp in 1Q and then the pandemic comp going the other way in the second quarter and then kind of more normalized in the back half of the year. So clearly, that’s the case in Merchant. And that mid to high-teens growth rate, as I said kind of averages out between the first two quarters with those two impacts and then is pretty consistent for the back two quarters. On the issuing side, as we said, from a kind of organic standpoint, we start kind of that mid to high growth rate. And then if we are going to actually look to be it or a low single-digit as a reported matter, the only thing I would highlight there is we did not assume commercial card recovering throughout the year. So that’s a headwind that plays itself out throughout the whole year. I would say we also have some – in addition to just the pre-pandemic comps, we also have some headwinds as it relates to just credit transaction volumes in the issuing business year-over-year as – and we’re seeing consistent with what the Visa numbers that they talked about for January. And as Cameron mentioned earlier, we did see improvement from January to December, but we still have some headwind on the transaction volume side and issuing that will play itself through the first quarter. And then on the Business and Consumer side, we kind of talked about it. We’ve got some tailwind as it relates to stimulus in the first quarter and then kind of more normalized kind of that mid single-digit growth rate that we talked about for the remaining three quarters. As it relates to expenses and margin, there isn’t anything necessary on the expense side. Obviously, where – we’ve done a really good job over the last two quarters of managing that expense rate to a pretty consistent year-over-year growth rate of roughly about 8%. And there’s nothing I would necessarily highlight other than the variable expenses that come with that revenue that I would call out on the expense side. So obviously, we’re very pleased to be in a position to yet again have a very impressive margin expansion as a consolidated matter. We did, as we said in our prepared remarks, have a much higher weighting of that margin expansion on the Merchant side than we did this last year, but we still expect to have nice margin expansion in both Issuing and Business and Consumer. And there wouldn’t be necessarily anything on a quarterly basis I could call out there.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. And then capital allocation, it’s good to see the incremental buyback announcement. I mean can you speak to the M&A pipeline though from a capital allocation perspective? Has your traditional view on making accretive acquisitions maybe changed in favor of acquisitions that might help revenue growth a little bit more, but not be accretive to the bottom line?
Jeff Sloan: Ashwin, it’s Jeff. I’ll start on your question. So the answer is no. Our view has not changed on capital allocation, our M&A pipeline is full. As you usually point out, we did almost $780 million of free cash flow just in the fourth quarter of 2020 and over $2 billion during the course of ‘20 in a pandemic caused depression. So we feel pretty good about our ability to generate free cash flow. So I would say nothing has changed there. We are looking for revenue growth opportunities on our side because we’ve got plenty of earnings. And obviously, showing our ability to grow margin very substantially even difficult macro-economic environments in ‘20, and that’s obviously our outlook for ‘21, too. So I don’t think any of that’s changed. These things aren’t usually exclusive. We’ve got plenty of firepower at 2.6x net leverage and $2 billion of free cash flow from last year to continue to make concurrent investments in ourselves, which we think is a good idea to do right now just like we thought it was in October in our third quarter call. We’ve got the flexibility thankfully and the wherewithal to do both those things and that’s what we will continue doing.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Good job. Keep up the good work.
Jeff Sloan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Darrin Peller: Hi, thanks guys. I want to go back just to follow-up on the capital allocation perimeter. We ended the year last year with some headlines over consolidation with is in the news and you guys. And it was obviously, at the time, rumors. But Jeff, if you could just revisit for us your vision of the industry for a minute in terms of the merits of consolidation scale versus your view of what you’re clearly doing now, which is investing in yourselves around omni-channel and cloud and other initiatives. I’d love to just hear your view on long-term, next few years, where you see the industry adding?
Jeff Sloan: Thanks, Darrin. It’s Jeff. So look, we’re in a scale business. I think that’s always been true. That continues to be true today and that’s going to be true tomorrow. So having more scale in the scale business is always a good idea. I think we’ve shown this with Harland. I think we’ve shown it with TSYS partnership. So I don’t think having scale in the technology business is really ever going to go out of favor. I think the fruit’s in the pudding, and you saw that in 2020, right, double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter coming out of the depression while the networks are shrinking. I don’t think you have to look further than that to realize that, that was a good idea. So I think at the end of day, those type of scale economies will drive further consolidation. But it’s not just consolidation for consolidation’s sake. I think the reasons in part that we look for further scale of opportunities is to make more investments back in our businesses. If you look at the areas that are growing most quickly for us during the pandemic, look at our omni-channel business, which accelerated again to the high teens in the fourth quarter of ‘20, which, by the way, Google is going on too Under our UCP product, look at our integrated business, which showed absolute growth in the fourth quarter and for the year, those are businesses, and of course, our software businesses, which did as well in certain of their vertical markets like AdvancedMD. Those are all businesses where we’ve made very substantial investments in over the last number of years. We couldn’t make those investments worldwide as we’re doing if we didn’t have the scale in the first place. So listen, my own view on the – in the business is we need to continue to invest in those areas that we think are ripe for future growth. We never could have pivoted this quickly to omni-channel to safer commerce if we hadn’t had those on the product development board in the first place and if we didn’t have the access to capital that we do from free cash flow, like to continue to make those investments. So in those context, obviously, additional scale makes sense. But very similar to the response, Darrin, because he has a very similar question to Ashwin, at the end of the day, none of that changes the strategy, really that we’ve been running the company with over the last 7 years plus, which is to say, focus on the 3 prongs at the end of the day, software partnership and ownership, on omni-channel acceptance and delivery and on the most attractive market. So the nice thing about 2020 with all the challenges it on every one of us was that it really validated all things that we’ve been talking about. So if we can find future transactions or partnerships that align with the 3 things that we’ve been talking about since 2013, but of course, scale and a scale business is going to be a good idea. So I think we view ‘20 and the recent events as really the validation of all stuff that we’ve been talking about. If we can find further ways to accelerate those investments, then we will.
Darrin Peller: That’s helpful. Just one quick follow-up, Jeff, you guys outperformed your Merchant business in the quarter. And I mean it’s pretty clear that it’s a tough quarter from a Merchant standpoint for revenue to really read a lot into what’s happening, given mix. But if you can give us any more color on the actual bookings kind of trends in the sense of number of merchants you’re adding. It seems like with all the initiatives you are holding up and you are actually gaining share, but it’s easier to see that if we had numbers around the number of merchants or bookings. So any more color on what happened there? So we know what could look like when it reopens? Thanks again guys.
Cameron Bready: Yes. Hey, Darrin, it’s Cameron. Maybe I will jump in on that one and I’ll ask Jeff or Paul to chime in as well if they would like to add anything. So maybe if I just step back and look at it from a macro standpoint in terms of overall net new sales performance for the year, I think it’s pretty easy to say that we’re delighted with the outcome, particularly given the backdrop that we were executing again for the full-year. So just a few highlights that I would share, one, Heartland for the year had new sales growth year-over-year relative to 2019 despite the pandemic, which I think speaks volumes to our relationship-led managers’ ability to go out and generate new business even in a really difficult environment. And obviously, they’ve been very creative and nimble in terms of how they’ve been able to do that. So Heartland grew net sales in 2020 notwithstanding the pandemic environment. Integrated exceeded our budgeted new sales forecast for the year by a pretty meaningful amount, an excellent new sales year for our Integrated business. New partner production was also about 140% of our budget. So not only did we see good, strong new sales of merchants, we saw good new business development partner production in that channel as well. And then in some of the vertical market businesses, AdvancedMD grew bookings 15% year-over-year. Our Xmal SaaS solution was up 20% year-over-year. Cuts Net had new sales performance that was pretty consistent with ‘19, again, notwithstanding the fact that many university and campuses were closed for much of the year with the beginning of the pandemic. So that just gives you a few ideas. Canada was up 20% in new sales year-over-year. So from a new sales execution standpoint, I think our performance was exemplary in 2020. And I am really delighted with the teams and what they were able to accomplish given the backdrop. I think the most important thing is we grew net mid count globally in 2020. So notwithstanding all the concerns around the SMB markets and all the concerns about small business failure, we grew mid count year-over-year, which is a good accomplishment in any market, in any environment, but a particularly good outcome in 2020 given the backdrop. So we feel very good about the health of the underlying portfolios that we are managing. We feel very good about the diversification of the businesses that we have the vertical markets exposures we have. To Jeff’s point in his script, we are diverse by design. Obviously, we’ve put a lot of effort into making sure that we have a Merchant business in particular that has a good mix of credit exposure that is not taking undue credit risk. It’s well diversified across geographies, verticals, types of underlying merchant customers. And I think that has helped us to have a more – relatively more resilient sort of performance over the course of 2020. And I think we exited the year at a pretty good place and have a lot of confidence heading into 2021 that the expectations we’ve set forth today are achievable, and we feel good about delivering against this. As I said earlier, January was better than December for us in our Merchant business and very much consistent with our expectations. It gives us confidence at least 1 month into the year that we are in a good trajectory to get to the outcomes we have provided today.
Darrin Peller: That’s great. Thanks, Cameron.
Cameron Bready: Thanks, Darrin.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.
Lisa Ellis: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just take a step back? I wanted a follow-up question on the Google partnership. And just in light of the Amazon partnership also from earlier this year, can you just maybe give it a high level compare and contrast the two a little bit? I know, obviously, Google is focused on Merchant, Amazon focused on Issuer. And just more strategically, I guess what do you – how do you see those impacting your business in 2021, 2022 and beyond? Thank you.
Jeff Sloan: Yes, Lisa. It’s Jeff. I’ll start and I’m sure Cameron. It’s an excellent question. So both businesses, both TSYS and Global Payments have had historical relationships with each of Amazon and Google for many years. So I think we’ve had a first row seat as to what those companies look like. We have a lot of respect for each. So why don’t I start with AWS? So our Issuer folks have worked with them for a number of years as part of their modernization initiatives. We’ve been very, very happy with them. I think you have to realize that it’s a slightly different proposition that we’re undertaking in the Issuer versus Merchant. So on the Issuer side, it’s technology modernization and transformation really at the same time, which is to say that code is going from more of a legacy code into cloud-enabled, able where it probably is today, and then into cloud-native ultimately, while it’s being lifted and shifted over to a cloud-hosted environment. So in the case of Google Hub, on the Merchant side, we’re really already there. Our businesses are really either cloud-enabled or cloud native already in their own rights. So the Google proposition is a little bit different on the technology side. It’s more of a shift rather than a lift and shift in the case of the Merchant business. I would say in the case of each, the go-to-market proposition though is very similar. We think AWS has a very distinctive and strong proposition among financial institution issuers. You can look up a lot of folks that they announced recently going to AWS Cloud. But we’ve had, as we said in our prepared remarks, we had very good experience already with one announced win and I think 3 to 4, we said are already mid to high probabilities in the pipeline. And probably another 4 or 5 that are lower probabilities, but also in the pipeline on the co-sell with AWS in the Issuer environment. So we view AWS, and I think it’s been proven so far in our experience today as having fantastic technologies, which we need for a long time, but also having terrific distribution to in the FI segment. Google, of course, has very many of the same things, but we view the Google co-sell more on the Merchant side, which is what Cameron was talking about, too. And really, there’s two pieces there that are also unique. So in the case of AWS, that’s a unique co-sell in FI land in the case of Google, it’s unique co-sell into merchant land. And on the merchant side, it’s really two pieces, as Cameron’s articulated with Google. The first one really is embedding their products and services uniquely into our already live Merchant portal, which, by the way, is already resonant for Global Payments and has been for years in the Google Cloud already, right? So we already have that. We are just blending their products into our Merchant cloud environment more seamlessly. And then the second piece, similar to AWS is a co-sale, meaning there’s actual quota at the Google level for Google sales reps to sell our products and services into the Google base. And we also have that ability of selling Google’s products and services into our portal like environment, which Cameron described some time ago. Very similar to what we’re doing with AWS, there’s quota on their sales reps and selling on the FI base. So while I would say that they are very similar in the sense of contract, they are a bit different when you think about where their target Issuer versus Merchant and when you think about the nature of the lifting shift that’s really going on in the case of the AWS side and the Google side is more of a shift.
Cameron Bready: And Lisa, it’s Cameron. I just add a couple of things on that, particularly as it relates to the Google partnership, just building on Jeff’s commentary. So first of all, as Jeff noted, we have a very long history with Google. We know them in the Merchant business extraordinarily well. They’ve been a terrific partner to us. And we expect them to be obviously a fantastic partner going forward. I think what struck me most as we thought about the opportunity is just the shared vision that we both have as it relates to helping Merchant customers do a couple of things. One is drive top of funnel opportunities for their business with new products and capability and innovation, particularly digitally, that will help do that for Merchant customers, particularly in an environment where they need that now more than ever. And then secondly, delivering products and capabilities that help businesses run more efficiently and more effectively. And I think we have Google Payments – excuse me, Global Payments and what Google has tried to accomplish are really geared towards those elements of supporting Merchant customers. And then lastly, we have very shared visions around innovation. And those things that we can do, again, that are going to help drive more customers through our customers’ businesses, while at the same time, again, helping them to run their businesses more effectively. And although we’re starting with Google My Business, Work Space and Ads, integrating that into our portal environment, we hope to add omni-channel ordering and search, service appointment availability, inventory, those types of solutions as well, again, trying to create a more distinctive, holistic offering of value-added services through our digital portal that we think will be, again, differentiated in the market for Global Payments, but more importantly, will really help our customers, again, to run and grow their businesses effectively.
Lisa Ellis: Super helpful. Great color. Thank you.
Jeff Sloan: On behalf of Global Payments, thanks for your interest in us and joining us this morning.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
