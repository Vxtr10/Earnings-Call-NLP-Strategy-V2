"Company Representatives: Odilon Almeida - President, Chief Executive Officer Scott Behrens - Chief Financial Officer
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you and good morning everyone. Today's call like all of our events is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC.  On this morning's call is Odilon Almeida, our President and CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Odilon.
Odilon Almeida: Thank you, John. Hello everyone! And thank you for joining our call. When we discussed our preliminary 2020 results in January, I shared my excitement about our strong performance and reinforced my confidence in the significant value creation potential of ACI. Today, we will provide you with a more detailed update on the 2020 results, 2021 outlook and growth initiatives. 
Scott Behrens: Thanks Odilon and good morning everyone. I first plan to go through our financial results for 2020 and then provide some additional commentary regarding our outlook for 2021. We will then open the line for questions.  For the full year 2020 total bookings were up 21%, while new bookings were up 36% compared to 2019. New bookings in our On Demand business more than doubled over last year, while new bookings in our On Premise license software business declined, primarily due to COVID related delays and purchasing decisions by our bank customers, which impacted significantly our license fee revenues.  2020 revenue was $1.29 billion, up 3% from 2019, largely due to having a full year of Speedpay results, offset by declines in non-recurring license fee revenue. Recurring revenue grew 10%, significantly above the total company revenue growth and now represents 76% of total revenue in 2020, up from 71% in 2019. 
Odilon Almeida: Thanks Scott. In closing, we are pleased with the company's performance in 2020 and look forward to continuing our momentum in 2021. We are well positioned to advance our three-pillar strategy and we are confident that we will continue to excel within our new organizational structure and increased focus on our higher growing areas.  In parallel, we are actively looking into investments and divestitures to maximize our growth profile and deliver transformational long-term value to our shareholders. I look forward to update you on our progress. We are now happy to take your questions. Thank you.
Operator:  We have our first question from the line of Mr. Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
Brett Huff: Good morning, guys. How are you?
Scott Behrens: Good morning.
Odilon Almeida: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Huff: Just a couple of questions; number one, congrats on the Mastercard joint win. I think it was Peru or somewhere in Latin America. Can you just give us – unpack that a little bit? You know how did the sales process go? Was it competitive? Kind of what got you guys over the finish line from a decision point of view?
Scott Behrens: Yeah, well to answer that, yeah, it is Peru. We had announced last summer that more enhanced partnership with Mastercard, and in particular, really targeting a specific list of countries to go to market on a joint effort, and that's really a product of that, that partnership that we announced last summer. So it's obviously getting early traction and we're really confident in that.
Odilon Almeida: Yeah, Brett, it’s basically the national switch and Mastercard is going to operate and we are going to be the software, so that's the summary of it.
Brett Huff: And so this is where you guys are doing most of the bank on ramp stuff, whereas Mastercard is doing the central hub. Is that kind of the division of labor?
Odilon Almeida: Correct, correct.
Brett Huff: Okay, that's helpful. Second question is just on the guidance. I think you guys said accelerating to mid-single digits in the back half. You had mentioned sort of mid-single digits I think over the next three years at the Analyst Day. Is that a little bit of a shift or we’re just feeling a little bit longer COVID negative impact in the first half? Is that what's going on or am I misreading that communication?
Odilon Almeida: Yeah, no Brett, we don't believe it's a shift. We continue to have the same guidance of before, we continue under COVID-19 as you just said, so there is impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter, no question about that. I mean nothing changed versus the Q4 quarter, so we continue to see our banks, you know delaying decisions on license revenue basically, so that's the only effect that we see. 
Brett Huff: Okay, that's helpful. And then last one, on the strategic review, any preview on that? I think you mentioned reviewing the portfolio, but kind of how broad or narrow is that? Just give us – you know I don't know how much you can say. I know there is an 8-K probably coming out soon, but just what are the kind of parameters of that, if you could give us any qualitative thoughts on it?
Odilon Almeida: It's very broad. I mean, we are – and that's what the third pillar is about, right. So there is no news here. I mean we – since the beginning we said that the third pillar is to provide step change value creation to our shareholders through M&A. That could be through divestiture of no strategic assets or buying some assets also in a highly accretive way and we continue to do that. So it's very broad and continues to be very broad, so.
Brett Huff: Okay, great. That's what I needed. I appreciate the time guys.
Scott Behrens: Sure. Thanks Brett.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Peter Heckmann from Davidson. Your line is now open.
Peter Heckmann: Good morning, gentlemen. Nice results in the fourth quarter. I wanted to see how you're thinking about both the renewal pipeline for 2021, as well as new business? If you can talk about where you might be seeing some RFP activity on a country basis or a large financial institution basis that we should be keeping in mind?
Scott Behrens: Yes, I'd say you know it’s somewhat similar comments I made in my prepared remarks you know. Even with 2020, it wasn't really the renewal book that was the issue. You know we have a solid renewal book in 2021. I would say really where we're seeing the growth opportunity is really going to come as those banks pick up spending in the second half of the year and what I'm referring to there is more the net new sales versus existing renewals. That was really where we fell short in 2020.  It was again not in renewals, but in net new spend, whether new logos or cross-sell of new applications. That's where we see in our pipeline this year that picking up, and that's going to allow us here in the second half of the year to get to deliver our long-term targets of mid-single digit.
Odilon Almeida: Yes Peter, being in calls with the CEO of banks here in the United States, in Singapore. I was in meetings in Brazil also with some CEOs of some banks. And what I can tell you is that I start to see light in the tunnel for the second half of this year. So they start to talk about the projects that they will not talk anymore about modernization, about going to the cloud. So I'm positive, I'm optimistic about the second half of the year. I think things will get more to a normal state business wise by the second half of this year.
Peter Heckmann: That's great, that's great. And then can you just talk about the interplay and maybe in some of the countries that already have real-time payments, the interplay between kind of more traditional biller direct bill pay and then real time payments? Maybe how much of the payment volume has shifted over to a direct account-to-account payment versus a card-based payments?
Odilon Almeida: I can tell you for example we have – I will give an example, because it becomes more real. I guess Brazil, the picks in Brazil right, I mean that has just been launched and is already like making like 5 million accounts already, like a few months. So when it starts, it starts very fast.  So there are basically three ways around the globe for payments right, and all the others are variances of these three ways. You can have physical cash; you can have cards or you can have real time payments. And what we expect going forward is that cash will continue to be stable and going down a little bit, and cards is not going to be growing as much as they have been growing in the past right, 20% plus, it's going to slow down a little bit. But the bulk of the growth has really been real-time payments and that's what we're seeing. It's a much more effective, efficient way and that's why everybody’s looking to that and that's why it's the center of our strategy.
Peter Heckmann: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Mr. George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
George Sutton: Thank you, and first my congratulations on your being responsive to shareholders with the upcoming Board adds. I think that's going to be well received.  I wanted to ask and maybe it's , but also in your script and in the press release you talked about long-term shareholder appreciation, and as you may know, given the history, long-term has always been an amorphous kind of an item, and I wanted to look at that up against Odilon your weekly sprints that you run in the business. Just to understand the sense of timing that everybody has in this whole process? Thanks.
Odilon Almeida: Yes, I know, and thank you George for that question, because you just – I think there is a flaw in the script, because we communicated I think the wrong thing. We are here for the short-term, for the middle-term and for the long-term. So it's value creation now, its value creation also in the long-term, and I think the most important proof for it is we are going to achieve the rule of 40 for the first time this year.  So after you know nine months, now it’s one year almost that I've been in company. This is going to be the first year ever that the company will achieve the rule of 40, so – and that creates value to shareholders, right. I mean immediate revenue to shareholders. So yeah, so great catch George. So we did about short, medium and long-term.
George Sutton: Alright, I really appreciate that clarification. Relative to your divestitures, you're talking about the slower growing areas, as you're increasing your investment in the faster growing areas, I'm just curious, how are you thinking of the investment of those areas that may or may not be targeted for a potential sale?
Odilon Almeida: Yeah. So basically you have areas on high growth, you have areas that are important for us, like billers and issuing and acquiring, that are not going to be growing by double-digits, but we will be growing by mid digits, by close to mid digits and we call protect and grow, and we have other divesture areas that we are looking to now, assets that are not strategic. So it is a fine balance on protecting the core areas, but releasing funds to invest heavily on the high areas.  Just to give you more color about that George, last year through bank we went through the first, I would say zero-base exercise of the company here, and they are real zero based. I was on top of it. Scott was very much close to it and with zero based investments of the company and we came from that point to see, ‘okay, what do we really need?’ And that's why by that time we were able to find $60 million this year and $75 million next year that we were able to reinvest in the business part of it and part of it I give it to bottom line, so. 
George Sutton: Perfect! I appreciate the thoughts.
Scott Behrens: Thanks George.
Odilon Almeida: Thanks George.
Operator:  There are no questions at this time sir. You may now proceed. Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, thanks everybody for joining us. We look forward to catching up with everybody in the coming weeks. Have a good day!
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
