At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the AppFolio First Quarter of 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  Thank you. Erica Abrams, you may begin your conference.
Erica Abrams: Thank you, Kelly. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today as we report AppFolio's first quarter 2019 financial results. I'm joined today by Jason Randall, CEO; and Ida Kane, CFO of AppFolio, to discuss these results. This call is simultaneously being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.appfolioinc.com.

Ida Kane: Thank you, Erica, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call today for AppFolio's first quarter of fiscal year 2019 financial results. Top line revenue growth accelerated in our first quarter of 2019 with revenue increasing 35% year-over-year to $57.1 million. GAAP net income was $3.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share during the quarter compared to $4.3 million and $0.12 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year, reflecting higher investments in growth initiatives that we believe will positively impact long-term shareholder value. Those investments include: first, the WegoWise acquisition completed in August 2018, which served as a foundation for our AppFolio utility management Value+ service that is now being used by AppFolio Property Manager customers; second, the development and launch of AppFolio Property Manager Plus in September 2018 to serve larger property manager customers; third, the January 2019 acquisition of Dynasty and its advanced artificial intelligence solutions for the real estate vertical; and finally, the development and recent launch of AppFolio investment management to serve real estate investment managers, which Jason will discuss further in a few minutes. Also included in our first quarter results is $1.6 million in non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation. For those of you who track non-GAAP results, our Form 10-Q was filed today and includes more detailed financial data points that you might find helpful in calculating non-GAAP results on your own. We closed the first quarter with 13,409 property manager customers managing 4.08 million units. These metrics reflect our continued efforts and success in acquiring higher unit count customers. As a reminder, we define our real estate property manager customer base as the number of customers subscribing to our core solutions. Customers that are not subscribing to our core solutions are not included in our customer and unit counts. In our legal vertical, customer count increased 8% year-over-year to 10,485. Core solution's revenue was $20.8 million in the first quarter, a 28% increase year-over-year, primarily due to a 20% increase in property manager units under management related to an 11% increase in the number of property manager customers. First quarter Value+ services revenue was $33.7 million, a 37% increase year-over-year. Revenue from each of our Value+ services increased year-over-year with the majority of growth derived from increased usage of electronic payments, screening and insurance services by a larger base of property manager customers and a higher number of units under management. Other revenue increased 72% to $2.6 million reflecting the revenue associated with recent acquisitions stand-alone subscription services revenue.
Jason Randall: Thanks, Ida, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today as we report our first quarter 2019 financial results. In the first quarter of 2019, we continued on our mission to revolutionize vertical industry businesses by providing great software and service to our expanding customer base. To that end, we invested in innovation, our technology platforms and product improvements designed to further deliver value to our customers. We remain focused on our customers' experiences and on our talented team and culture, which we believe is a key element of our success. We remain committed to our long-term strategy of sustainable growth. On the topic of innovation, we released AppFolio investment management, which empowers real estate investment managers with a modern solution that streamlines fund and syndication management. We worked on this product in close cooperation with key customers, such as Northwest Commercial Real Estate. Northwest's principal of Morris Coverman wanted to connect his investors to investment and they recently told us, AppFolio investment management offers our investors more transparency and more information on their investments. The AppFolio investor portal provides easy access to statements, appraisals, property information cash flows, K-1s and more, making it a very effective and modern way to communicate with our investors. AppFolio investment management is designed to enable investors to more efficiently manage their business, all within the simplicity of a single solution. We believe this innovation will transform customers' businesses, improve processes and streamline investors' experiences.
