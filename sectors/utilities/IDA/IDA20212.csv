"Operator: Welcome to IDACORP's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded, and our webcast is live. A complete replay will be available later today and for the next 12 months on the IDACORP website.  I will now turn the call over to Justin Forsberg, Director of Investor Relations and Treasury.
Justin Forsberg: Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everybody. This morning, we issued and posted to IDACORP's website our second quarter 2021 earnings release and Form 10-Q. The slides that accompany today's call are also available on our website. We'll refer to those slides by number throughout the call today.
Lisa Grow: Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. I'd like to begin my remarks by highlighting the continued robust customer growth we are experiencing across Idaho Power service area. You'll see on Slide 5 that the growth remained strong in the second quarter, increasing 2.9% since June 2020. The influx of businesses and residential customers continues to benefit our company, while we believe the reliable, affordable, clean energy we provide remains one of the drivers for attracting new customers to Idaho. It has been remarkable to see this trend not only sustain but accelerate over the past several years. We are also seeing a return-to-normal operations for many of our commercial and industrial customers as our service area rebounds from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Steve Keen: Thank you, Lisa. Let's now move to Slide 10, where you'll see our second quarter 2021 financial results as compared to the same period in 2020. Overall, we have experienced a very solid first half of the year, with strong customer growth, positive impacts from transmission services and higher revenues resulting from the heat wave that affected much of the Western U.S. Because of these factors, IDACORP's second quarter net income was substantially higher than last year. On the table of quarter-over-quarter changes, you'll see our continuing customer growth added $3.9 million to operating income. Also, increased usage per customer drove operating income higher by $22.9 million. Cooling degree days were nearly double last year's second quarter and the hot and dry conditions led to significantly higher usage across all customer classes.
Operator:  Your first question comes from Chris Ellinghaus with Siebert Williams.
Chris Ellinghaus: I got a million questions where there's a lot of exciting stuff here. First of all, should -- is it time to get worried at all about next year's reservoir levels considering sort of the outlook for precipitation and the expectation that there might be another La Nina developing for the fall. So can you just sort of give us your thoughts on that and where reservoir levels are today?
Lisa Grow: Yes. Certainly, I can start. Chris, this is Lisa. One of the things I was taught very early in my career is that no amount of worry actually puts any water in the reservoir. So it's not so much that we worry about it, but we certainly planned for the worst-case scenarios. And so we are being careful about how we're using the water. I would remind you, we have a -- we do have some weather modification that we utilize to pull as much as we can out of each storm that does come through. And I would also remind you that La Nina actually can produce really good snowpack for us as well. Often, it's more the case that it does than doesn't, but I'm reminded that last year was also a La Nina. So I don't know that there's a great trend line really on that. It's just that it continues to be variable. So we certainly know how to operate during those conditions. It does mean that we rely more on the market, and we will -- it's the value of a diverse portfolio that we can access other sources of energy when we are in drought condition. And Adam, is there anything that you would add from -- that I'm missing from an operations perspective?
Adam Richins: No. I think you covered it. It's a little bit too early to tell, but we are focused on it, and we, in fact, have some meetings over the next month or so to make sure we keep an eye on it.
Steve Keen: Lisa? Chris, let me add one thing. It's been a while since we've talked about these issues. But if you go back a few years, we've had multiple times that we've had several years in a row that we had drought-like condition. And one good thing is the Brownlee Reservoir sort of hits a bottom, that bottom might move slightly. But the level we're at right now, I think, is nearing the point. It kind of doesn't go below that even in bad years. Now that doesn't mean that's an optimum thing because it would much rather have a lot more water, but it doesn't go down to 0 or at least hasn't in what we've seen. It's -- it kind of stops at a certain level in the spring  and other things. So...
Chris Ellinghaus: Okay. Lisa, can you talk about what you were saying on the commercial and industrial recovery, where do you feel like you are compared to normal? And what did this quarter look like versus last year from what you can interpret the COVID situation?
Lisa Grow: Well, as I mentioned in the remarks, we really are seeing a return to normal levels. And then some of the new business is starting to show up as well. So there have been some maintenance cycles that have happened during the last year that felt a little bit out of cycle from their normal timing, but I think they might have been taking advantage of what was going on in the world to do some maintenance in a time that was slightly different than normal. So I would say, it's getting really close to normal levels. And as we mentioned, lots of planned increases as well. So we're very excited about that return because also, that means people are getting back to work, and we're very optimistic.
Chris Ellinghaus: Okay. I just want to make sure I'm clear on this. You said a couple of times that the revised guidance is assuming normal for the second half of the year. So you haven't included any consideration for what appears to be a pretty hot and dry July so far?
Steve Keen: Chris, the way I would put it is, we don't put those in our baseline or in that. What we would say is our midpoint, we don't really tell you where that is in our range. But we do factor those in as we're looking higher, but you always have heard me talk about third quarter and July looks really good, that the whole quarter itself is a massive part of what we get for the year. So it -- the thought is in there. It's not -- I'd just say, it's a range and we put in the comment there towards the end, that we're also starting to approach where you start sharing a little bit. We don't stop necessarily at sharing that you do slow down. And so I think this is a reasonable range. We come up with the script. It's midway through July and most of it's getting charted out. But as you point out, it's been pretty hot, and it's continued on.
Chris Ellinghaus: Okay. When does the sort of the unofficial end of the irrigation season really hit for you?
Lisa Grow: It generally is late August, September, depending on the crops that are planted. So I would say it's generally into September, early September.
Steve Keen: Yes. That's one area, Chris, where I think we don't know sometimes if we just got irrigation earlier or how much of it is going to be an absolute up. So that is one of the question marks that kind of you wait until you get to end of August and you kind of know what you -- what really happened, how much of that was all up and how much was just sooner.
Chris Ellinghaus: Right. Lisa, you mentioned this cobalt mine. Can you give us some details on what kind of load does that look like?
Lisa Grow: I'm going to have Adam Richins answer that. He's been more directly involved with that. Adam, do you want to take that one?
Adam Richins: You bet. Chris, one of the things, I think, you noticed that gets a little bit touchy with our customers in talking about the load, tend to be a bit confidential for them. So I can't get into that. Right now, they're focused on a mid-2022 in-service date. And I'll just tell you, I've been up there. I've looked at the mine, and it's moving in terms of construction. So that's what they've said publicly. And in terms of the load, you can't get into that, but we're pretty excited about what it will bring to our service territory.
Chris Ellinghaus: Will you be able to later talk about load or maybe what the scale of the mine is?
Adam Richins: Yes, it all depends on whether they're willing to go out with that information publicly. A lot of these folks consider it competitive information if others are looking at what their load is, then they can determine what -- how much they're buying and some of those types of things. So it really depends on the customer. I would love to share more, but they have to let us know kind of when it's okay for us to do so.
Chris Ellinghaus: Okay. And Lisa, you sort of were talking about depending on the coal retirements and obviously, had some new peak lows and whatnot. Can you give us your general thoughts on new resources? Obviously, IRP details are somewhat fluid, but can you sort of talk about what your vision is? And would you imagine participating in any kind of material new resources?
Lisa Grow: It's a great question. So as you mentioned, the IRP is really the process we go through to identify our future resources. But we do have an RFP out there on the street for 80 megawatts that we didn't have previously in the plan. It really came up from the analysis we did on looking on whether or not we could take the second unit of Valmy out earlier. And when we refreshed all the variables, it demonstrated that we were going to need something sooner. And something that was a capacity resource, not just energy. And so we're looking forward to getting the results back there. And then we are looking at all kinds of resources. And again, that analysis, that goes into the RFP -- or excuse me, the IRP is really critical. So that's where we can test sort of the technologies against one another on their performance and costs. So I am very optimistic. I think there's a lot of exciting opportunities out there. And I'll let the IRP run its course, and we'll have more information available at that point. That should be out by the end of this year.
Operator: Your next question is from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America.
Ryan Greenwald: Maybe first, can you guys just talk a bit about any shift in dynamics amid the latest scarcity concerns when it comes to the planned early acceleration of Jim Bridger? So in terms of any initial conversations with stakeholders and any change in mindset there?
Lisa Grow: Yes, I'm not sure. I mean we've been certainly, again, talking with the IRP and other stakeholders about what that might look like. And certainly, we talk with our partner over at PacifiCorp. Recall they're the majority owner, operator of that plant. So I don't think there's been anything that I could say is a change of how we've been thinking about it in the past. So maybe I'm not fully understanding the question you're asking.
Steve Keen: Yes, Ryan, the -- if you look at the 2 plants that we already have moved through that process, the fact that the end-of-life costs and some of those things kind of have just set out there from -- you start the plan and you think that's kind of just so far, you don't think about it. As you get in there, you have to start encompassing the whole -- the final answer for any of these plants. So that Bridger decision, as Lisa mentioned, the last higher piece, the best information we've got in terms of timing, they're always working hard on the next one. But there's pieces of that in order of spreading those costs over periods of time, collecting them from the customers that are getting enjoyment of the use of the plant. All of those things, none of that has really changed or moved, and that is a lot of the impetus behind the filing.
Ryan Greenwald: Got it. So it sounds like at this point, you guys trying to proceed with the earlier acceleration, not too concerned about a slowdown?
Steve Keen: Not too much. I guess I pointed to, that is the beauty of this, the way that both of Valmy decisions were put out and Boardman, they both allowed flexibility. So they are kind of a living plan once you put them out. You start with a plan. There's plan A, and then it adjusts in the depth. If you report -- if the -- it's got a process that allows the oversight to continue all through the process and continual updates. So I think the -- starting with the process is still a good thing, and you never really are going to hit a point when you know perfectly the answer for the future. So that's -- we focus more on a mechanism that could live through those types of things.
Lisa Grow: I think it's worth noting, too, to remind you in the fascinating on the Valmy agreement that the final depreciation date was actually past the date of when we would finish or cease operations there. So if we did have to change the operation date, it doesn't change the depreciation schedule. So it's -- we do have some movement capability there.
Ryan Greenwald: Understood. And then maybe lastly, with respect to the BPA intention to sell their stake, any more color you guys can provide there around time line and how this could play out in coming months in terms of your potential ownership?
Lisa Grow: Well, we're still working with our partners on that. So there isn't a lot more that we can say, but they are active conversations, and we continue to work through it.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Russo with Sidoti.
Brian Russo: So just curious, this might sound silly, but is there a scenario where it can be too hot and too dry, where the demand is exceeding your generation capacity and with low hydro conditions, you need to go out and buy high-priced power, which is what led to the margin -- negative margin variance on the PCA?
Steve Keen: I don't -- too much might be not the best terminology, but certainly, when  gets really high and you cover power, and it's a balancing process. I mean I think we refer to it typically as balancing, and you're waiting  your water now, you save it until later in the year, do you -- is the market giving us an opportunity to buy the day at a better price, so we can keep one of our resources for later. That's what the operators do constantly is try to sort that out. But it certainly can drive high cost. And if you remember back, we've had some years in our past, when we've had really high-power costs. There was 1 year when they were so high, we offered to spread them over a couple of years, and they ended up going ahead and collecting it in a single year. But it does drive the costs up. You are somewhat subject to the market for parts of it. And we do the best we can there, and we try to manage that. I think the hydro is really nice and that we have a little more choice with it at times than others. So we'd like to have more of it. But we started this year with a pretty normal amount in the -- as far as carryover, we probably were slightly below normal when we hit summer just because we've used some in the spring, but it was close. And so you can hit it even if you have a pretty good year, there could be days that you go to market.
Lisa Grow: And Adam, do you want to add any color? Because we have a relatively new group of leaders in operations, and they were really creative looking out and seeing some of this coming and moving quickly to adapt.
Adam Richins: Yes. Thanks for the question. It's a good one. We experienced in June a one in 45-year event in our service territory, and it's just Northwest, it was a one in 1,000-year event. And as Steve mentioned, although the conditions of carryover were decent, we had one of the driest springs in memory. And we were absolutely able to work through it. The system held up well. We have operational folks. This is what they train for. This is what they're ready for. We did have to buy more energy on the market, but we also have processes that in -- before these times come, to make sure we're being proactive, sometimes we hedge some of those purchases as well. We also actively bought some transmission on the market that maybe we had done in the past. So it's really just -- in a lot of ways, it's just kind of what we do. Does it make it more tight on our system? Absolutely. But so far, our system has been performing well, and we've been pleased with the results.
Brian Russo: Right. Got it. So the $6.8 million of negative net income driver related to power of supply costs. That implies you're already in the 95%-5% sharing, correct?
Steve Keen: The 95%-5% is on all power supply costs. So everything, a good or bad. So if we are experiencing lower than normal costs, 95% of the savings goes back to customers, and we get to keep 5% when the costs are higher, and this is Idaho primarily that I'm talking about. The 95% goes to -- they bears the cost is the customer, and then we take the other 5%. If you -- that used to be a pen 90%-10% split, then it was adjusted, and we're at 95%-5% now. And that's all based on whatever was in the last rate case. So it factors off of that is you really start with whatever within your last rate -- your last general rate case and then the 95%-5% works either direction off of that number.
Brian Russo: Okay. Got it. And then the IRP filing, I think you got an extension to December, but I think the target month was in September of 2021 to file. Is that still the goal? Or is it going to be pushed back, do you think, towards the end of the year?
Lisa Grow: Our goal has been around November. And right now, we're on track to meet that.
Brian Russo: Okay. And then also the e-megawatt RFP, is that a purchase power agreement-type scenario? Or is that something you would consider self building?
Lisa Grow: Well, we're looking to do a little of both. I mean, obviously, we would love to build and own, but we're also wanting to make sure that people respond to the RFP. So we're looking at -- we're open to a number of possibilities.
Brian Russo: Okay. And then lastly, can you remind us what BPA's percentage stake is in the B2H?
Lisa Grow: I believe it was 24%.
Brian Russo: Okay. So 24% of, I guess, that $1.1 billion kind of cost you guys disclosed?
Lisa Grow: Yes.
Operator: Your next question is from Ashar Khan Verition.
Ashar Khan: So I just wanted to, I guess, there are a couple of things happening, if I may mention, right, to what people are talking about. But the higher load and the higher warm weather is generally positive for earnings. Is that fair to assume?
Lisa Grow: I'd say that, yes.
Steve Keen: Generally.
Ashar Khan: Okay. Because we've had a good July. So as you are mentioning, we still have to wait for August and, I guess, September somewhat, but August is a key month, if I'm right, right? So that -- and that is not yet included in your forecast. But you did mention that if you go over, I guess, the top end of your range 490s, right, you would be in the sharing mechanism, if I heard it correct.
Steve Keen: Yes. It's not -- we're not saying the 490 is the number. We're just letting people know that it's not a long way past that the -- where the allocator sits currently. It doesn't move around, so it can actually shift up and down a few pennies itself. But it's beyond that upper range today.
Ashar Khan: So it's beyond -- okay. So it's not at 490. It is something above that, that is when the sharing will happen.
Steve Keen: Correct. We just wanted people to remember that there is a place where it slows down. And earnings don't necessarily stop at sharing. It's just the -- you can do accumulate...
Ashar Khan: Yes, yes, yes. No, I just wanted to -- I was just doing a rough back-ended math is that at what level do you reach 10%, right? That's when sharing start, right? And my earnings number calculation were coming that earnings have to go over $5 to reach that level. So when you said 490, I got a little bit confused. So I wanted to check my math with you, whether I was missing something.
Steve Keen: Well, Ashar, you're trying to get a number that hasn't happened yet. So it is a tough number to hit. It's going to be a year-end calculation. It's going to depend on how many sales happened in Oregon, how many sales happened in Idaho, which class happens, which place is -- so it's a very complex allocator that at this point in time, we kind of have a -- some in the air ideas where it's going to be, but it's going to move most likely from what we think it is today. It's affected by -- it's year-end equity.
Ashar Khan: Understood. Understood. I totally understood it, but it's not at 490 right now. That's my main point. I guess I just wanted to clarify that, right?
Steve Keen: You're correct. It's above that.
Ashar Khan: It's above that. Okay. That's what I just wanted a clarification on. Okay. Okay. And then if I just -- any update on the relicensing issue and still a 2023 event in your eyes?
Lisa Grow: Well, it's an ongoing process. At this point, we believe that, that still is possible, but there's the goblet of things we've got to go through to get there, but that's our best guess today.
Ashar Khan: Okay. Okay. And then I'm just trying to -- just for reference purposes. As you are seeing this higher growth in the service territory. And one thing which has happened, if you look at your -- the annual report and all that, is that our ROEs have gone a little bit down, right? Sometimes we earn 9.6%, 9.4%. I guess the last year, based on your annual report and that, I guess, you do based on the total stock as book value of the whole company. So it's a mixture, is 9.3% was at the low end. So from your perspective, what is the ideal rate? Is it 9.3%, 9.4%, 9.5%? Where should one kind of like set one's horizon in terms of planning for the future with this higher growth? And I just wanted to get your thoughts on it.
Steve Keen: So, you'd say it ideal, I mean, they do move. There's years that we have better support, say, out of our subsidiaries. Our Oregon property has no mechanism around it, the way Idaho does. So it has variability. And so the reality is there are some years we don't get as high as others. But the goal is to 
Lisa Grow: To maximize, yes.
Steve Keen: Yes. So we're aiming to maximize. And I think we've talked many times about weighing the -- whether you're filing, whether you're not filing, how much this growth continues to bring. And COVID did throw some question marks into that. I think we just weren't sure where we're sitting today and with the year that's happening now, it appears that growth is still alive and well, and we're kind of just hanging on to keeping up and making sure we serve everything to come. So that's some of the years you're looking at there were impacted by, I think -- I don't think any of us saw it coming, I certainly didn't have the pandemic in mind 5-year window back in  So I don't know what to say about that, Ashar. It does move around just about -- but I think we're sitting in a good place, and the story we've had is still on track. I think the growth continues to be our interim answer. And as Lisa talked about, some of our growing needs, and we've put out reports in our shareholder updates on CapEx growth. There's a different story that's building -- that's kind of our future. So it's -- that's -- we're still on that track.
Ashar Khan: Okay. And if I can ask a last question, right. So if you look at it on a consolidated basis, right? The book value is increasing by $2. And if you apply, say, roughly, I want to go to the lower end 9, right, ROE on that, that gives you like $18 million. And if you divide it by 50 million shares, that gives you like -- annually, you should grow by about at least kind of somewhere in the $0.30 range, but we don't achieve that. So I'm just trying to understand what is the right way to look at the increase in book value because that's a consolidated book value, right? It's not the -- the IDACORP is where the mechanism is. So what is a good number for IDACORP's increase in book value? Is it $1.50? Or what is the right number to want to think about?
Steve Keen: So the mechanism is an Idaho mechanism that looks at the Idaho allocation of the equity for Idaho Power. So it's -- the mechanism isn't sitting in IDACORP.
Ashar Khan: Understood. That's why I was asking, what is a good number to look at from an IDACORP's perspective for increase in equity every year?
Steve Keen: Yes, we haven't put that out, Ashar. I mean that's why we put the chart that we've been sharing for quite a number of years on -- we give you the chart of year-over-year changes. And with that, you can kind of look through and see the years that we've hit sharing and that, that's put a limiter and you kind of do your own calculations of where those support mechanisms, like, might be, which kind of gives you a bottom, and then you could figure out where the sharing might be above that. And people use that to ban their estimates.
Ashar Khan: Okay. Okay. Okay. I thought I would try it once more to see if I can make my model more accurate, but appreciate it. Great results. And just a reminder, when is your -- some -- I have lost track. Previously used to come out with your dividend policy in August. Is that still the case? Or now it's didn't been delayed into the fall?
Steve Keen: For the last few years, we've made our dividend changes when we've done it in September, kind of -- I think, we announced that, that was the plan we were going to go with. Normally, given some sort of an indication what to expect might come in the next year, but then we didn't actually do it and announce it until we are through September.
Ashar Khan: Okay. So we should wait till September.
Steve Keen: Yes, it's actually with our release. I think that we made it our for the third quarter.
Operator: Your next question is from Vedula Murti with Hudson Bay Capital.
Vedula Murti:  line, how much of the -- your 21% already reflected in the existing CapEx 5-year plan that you have if you probably  support?
Steve Keen: As some of it is in there, it's -- I can't remember how much actually gets in, in terms of construction. A lot of it is just the preconstruction and the planning and the licensing piece. So...
Lisa Grow: Adam? I'm not sure I heard the question.
Adam Richins: Yes. The construction period is 2003, 2006, and that's where the bulk of the funds will be expended.
Steve Keen: 23 to 26, yes. So it was...
Vedula Murti: So a 23, 24 .
Lisa Grow: Yes.
Adam Richins: And that would be the earliest from our standpoint.
Vedula Murti: And can I the just add some in terms of whether you think that actual will go? Or is it just in terms of looking to any other  approvals, environmental, other things? And if there are still some probability that this will not pass?
Adam Richins: Lisa, I'm happy to answer that.
Lisa Grow: Yes. Go ahead, Adam.
Adam Richins: Yes. The federal permitting, we've received those permits, and that's the an EPA process. We are in federal litigation on those permits, but we've received actual permits. The state permitting should be completed, we believe, the second half of 2022. And B2H continues to be our lease cost, lease risk resource as we look at through the 2019 IRP. And so yes, we're moving ahead. We think we're making good progress. And our partners in PAC is also moving ahead and excited about the project. So yes, we think it's moving forward at a good pace.
Vedula Murti: So I guess at this point, when do you think you'd be -- you're looking to be able to  this is -- that we are  and this is a real project and system costs and just time line and this is what we're doing?
Adam Richins: Well, right now, our schedule shows, as I mentioned, a 2023 kind of construction window to 2026. That's the earliest it would occur. We would, obviously, need to get our permits before that. Some of that depends on what occurs with litigation in the federal permitting. But again, right now, our partners are moving forward with it, and we feel good about the progress.
Vedula Murti: And is there anything -- is there anything formalized about the process of EPA , will it  there share? And if you were to acquire it, was there anything ever in terms of the formula under which you would -- you've always known that you might pay BPA for their share? Or is this just a flat-out negotiation?
Adam Richins: It's in the -- this is Adam, again. It's in the middle of negotiations. We're exploring different asset service and ownership arrangements, frankly, with BPA. One scenario though would include Idaho Power acquiring BPA's ownership share, and then we would on the back end, provide BPA long-term transmission service in lieu of ownership for them. And in that scenario, we would have, instead of the 21% interest we have now, it would increase up to 45%. But again, these discussions are preliminary and confidential in nature. At the end of the day, our intent is to maximize the value of the project for all parties. And so we're in the middle of those discussions, and we'll advise when we can.
Vedula Murti: Okay. Different topic. The Jim Bridger increasing the depreciation spend. To the extent that the commission work to  a different number, you simply achieve that number and if they chose not to  not go forward with it. So it's simply a matter of whatever the commission will end up agreeing upon, you'll be able to do that but you choose something if they choose something different. That's due to -- you wouldn't see the request if they gave something different.
Steve Keen: Well, it's like -- if I'm following Vedula, what we're saying is we've got our best information file. That's what's going in right now with the case that was put before the commission, knowing that a lot of the pieces and parts of that could move or change. And so it's going to allow for those dynamics to move and adjust. I think that's anticipated that there would be updates to that. It isn't -- it's very difficult to set all of that it be perfect at this point. So encompassed in that is sort of a dynamic response element to the way that the rate mechanism works.
Vedula Murti: What's the time line that's anticipated for  to decide and processes 
Steve Keen: December.
Adam Richins: Yes.
Steve Keen: So looking at -- yes.
Lisa Grow: That was a request, yes.
Steve Keen: That was a request, yes. Certainly, the commission could take other actions, but that's what it would be under a normal course.
Vedula Murti: And I guess the other thing I just  very curious, obviously, you mentioned the RFP for the megawatts and also highlighting  a very strong growth in territories. When should we be expecting an update on the Apple program because we see even a mineral to base CapEx just to -- for maintenance payments or service  would have to be going up given the new customers, et cetera. So when should we be expecting a revision on capital program?
Lisa Grow: I think we give frequent updates with some of the...
Steve Keen: Yes. It's been going up each of the last couple of years. And I don't have a number to give you for next year. But you're right, as growth maybe outputs what you were expecting, it often means you're going to have to spend a little more money in the following year. But that's usually a year-end process for us where we update those numbers. And so you'll see, your next update from us would -- on just an annual basis would be with our year-end earnings release. But we do occasionally put out -- we'll take it out to all share owners through a -- we've updated our booklets at times. And so you might keep an eye on that. If you have -- there's some out there. I don't know, when the last time the CapEx forecast changed. But the CapEx forecast that we currently have out is, if you haven't looked for a while, may surprise you what it shows that our expectations of growth have gone up quite a bit.
Vedula Murti: No. I'm taking a look at your investor book, and I wasn't clear whether those are the things that are prospective that are possible. And I think you've shown things that are impossible to occur versus things that are formally in your official plan 
Steve Keen: Yes. It's probably a mix because parts of it are building off of what our normal CapEx program has been. But they change and they do go up at times. And then there's other pieces that are maybe planned or hopeful that timing could shift year-to-year or amounts change. So it's a blend.
Operator: And a final opportunity.  That concludes the question-and-answer session for today. Miss Grow, I will turn the conference back to you.
Lisa Grow: Thank you again to all of you for your continued interest in IDACORP. And we certainly look forward to the possibility of meeting with you in person later this year, and I continue to wish you all good health, and have a great evening. Thank you very much.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."
