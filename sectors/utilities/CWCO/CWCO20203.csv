"Operator: Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Consolidated Water Company’s Third Quarter of 2020 Results. Joining us today is the Chief Executive Officer of Consolidated Water Company, Rick McTaggart; and the company’s Chief Financial Officer, David Sasnett. Following their remarks, we’ll open the call to your questions. Before we conclude today’s call, I’ll provide some important cautions regarding the forward-looking statements made by management during the call. I’d like to remind everyone that today’s call is being recorded and will be made available for telecom replay via instructions in yesterday’s press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website.
Rick McTaggart: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today’s call. I hope everyone is well. Fortunately, Consolidated Water has not been impacted by the adverse conditions created by the pandemic as much as others. Our team has worked diligently throughout the pandemic to ensure that we are able to continue our operations and pursue additional projects that can strengthen our business. During the third quarter of 2020, we managed to generate substantial revenue growth and returned to profitability from Q2. Over the first nine months of the year, we were also profitable generating nearly $11 million in cash from operations. Our Q3 top line growth is largely due to the $3.2 million in revenue contributed by our new PERC Water subsidiary. PERC’s core business which provides engineering, construction and management services for water treatment infrastructure in the United States has met our expectations so far this year in spite of the pandemic. And so far, we’ve seen no material impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on its day-to-day operations. The management team at PERC has been focused on increasing its recurring revenue through multi-year operating contracts, and consequently PERC was awarded four operating contract renewals and two new operating contracts during the first nine months of this year. I’ll provide more details about the growth opportunities we see with PERC later in the call. Our retail segment experienced a decline in revenue in Q3 compared to last year, mainly due to the continuing closure of the borders in the Cayman Islands to tourist travel and this is in response to the pandemic., It was also lower because of much wetter weather conditions in the Cayman Islands during the third quarter. The seaport and airport in the Cayman Islands have been closed to tourists since March, which has reduced visitors and tourism to nil. However, as of the first of October, residents and property owners have been allowed to return to the Cayman Islands subject to quarantining for 14 days after arrival. This has allowed flights from the United Kingdom and the U.S. to resume on a reduced schedule. To encourage more long-term visitors, the Cayman Islands government recently implemented a Global Citizen Concierge program, whereby tourist visas are granted to individuals and families who wish to reside and work remotely in the islands for up to two years. These developments are very encouraging and can help bring much needed economic activity back to these islands.
David Sasnett: Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Despite the challenges presented by the current economic environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue in the third quarter increased 11.2% to $17.7 million, compared to $15.9 million in the same period of last year. This increase is largely due to the additional $3.2 million revenue from PERC Water, which we acquired in October 2019. We also saw a slight increase in our manufacturing segment revenue of approximately $187,000.
Rick McTaggart: Thank you, David. I’d like to share a little more about our manufacturing business. This segment is entirely comprised of Aerex, our manufacturing subsidiary based in Fort Pierce, Florida. Aerex is primarily a custom manufacturing shop. So its contracts are typically shorter term than those in our other businesses. As David mentioned, our manufacturing segment results for the quarter benefited from a favorable production mix that resulted in an increase in its revenue and gross profits for the third quarter. In October, Aerex’s largest customer informed us that it expects to suspend its purchases until the first quarter of 2022, due to inventory management reasons. We’ve been focused for some time now on diversifying Aerex’s customers and products, and believe that we have a good opportunity to replace some or all of this anticipated lost revenue by increasing sales of other products Aerex’s manufacturers for existing and potentially new customers. Bidding activity for the new water treatment projects in our current market area remains robust, and PERC through its strong presence in the Southwestern United States is helping Aerex to expand its market into that area. The addition of PERC has been highly complementary to our existing business and overall mission supporting our pursuit of water reuse projects and other emerging opportunities with a comprehensive suite of solutions for improving water infrastructure. PERC also provides us a solid platform on which to expand to North America, our core business of designing, constructing and operating seawater desalination plants. In the third quarter, we acquired an additional 10% of PERC from another shareholder for $900,000, raising our ownership to 61% and underscoring our competence in the PERC business model and its markets. PERC represents the principal component of our services segment and has maintained its positive performance since we acquired a controlling interest in October of last year. We are especially encouraged by the prospects in this area of our business as PERC continues to actively pursue various potential new projects and contracts. Several of these could have a substantial positive impact on PERC’s results of operations should be ultimately be successful in capitalizing on these opportunities.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question is from Gerry Sweeney with ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.
Gerry Sweeney: Good morning, Rick and David. Thanks for taking the call.
Rick McTaggart: Good morning, Gerry.
David Sasnett: Good morning, Gerry. How you’re doing?
Gerry Sweeney: Doing well. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more information on PERC, specifically maybe how large their pipeline is or backlog? How large the backlog is versus a couple quarters ago? And how much visibility you have into sales for the next couple of quarters? And then part two on PERC would be how much is recurring revenue versus during construction.
David Sasnett: Gerry, we’ve added a risk factor in our 10-Q that talks about the amount of revenue that potentially could not be renewed from these operations in management contracts. Assuming that those contracts are renewed, I think what you’re seeing with PERC right now is substantially all of their revenue is of a recurring nature, because they’re for operations and maintenance contracts. PERC also has an element of their business, which is a design build. But at the moment that particular revenue does it cost to very much of their total revenue. I think what excites us about the business is, they are pursuing a number of design build contracts, which are very significant, as we said earlier, in terms of size and revenue. We can’t provide any assurances that when these contracts, but they certainly have a number of interesting targets.
Gerry Sweeney: Could you – how many total contracts does PERC have today?
David Sasnett: I don’t have that number on the top of my head, because it’s changed somewhere around 20.
Gerry Sweeney: Okay. But – okay, that’s helpful. I just was wanting magnitude versus for being renewed and these design build opportunities, is there an opportunity that they themselves lead to an O&M opportunity?
David Sasnett: Yes. Some of these contracts, I mean, their business is very similar to our desalination business. Often we’ll build a plant for third-party and then run it for them or operate the plant and  Cayman. Similar possibility exists for PERC’s business. They could build a plant and make money off selling the plant. Then at the same time, they could enter into an O&M contract to run the plant.
Gerry Sweeney: Got it. Switching gears to the retail side, obviously it’s going to be a – that’s going to face headwinds until a vaccine comes out and as you said United States starts to rebound. But specifically about the quarter, would you know how much impact was rain versus tourism? And it just even broad brush is fine. I’m out of curiosity there.
Rick McTaggart: The best thing I could say is look at what the volume drop was in the second quarter, which I think was a couple of percentage points less than what it was in the third quarter. So I mean it went from I think 15% to 18% down and maybe that other 3% is related to the rain. Maybe it’s not, I mean it’s really hard to determine, but it did go up in the third quarter.
Gerry Sweeney: Got it. And then final question in the – I was waiting the queue, and you have a note in there about the Rosarito project. I think you submitted, if I read it right non-recoverable assets of $51.1 million. One, is that correct? And two, any type of timeline or thoughts on how that moves along at develops?
Rick McTaggart: Well, I’d like to hope that it develops quickly, but it’s a legal issue now, Gerry. So it’s very difficult to say how long that’s going to take. And if the total is closer to $56 million, so there’s a certain amount in pesos and then there’s a certain amount in U.S. dollars that we’ve…
Gerry Sweeney: Got you. Sorry, I apologize, this is – and an additional on the peso line, it’s all that.
Rick McTaggart: So we are – I can assure shareholders, we are working very hard and looking at every way possible to recover that money. So I’m spending a lot of my time on that right now. So I can’t tell you when it could get worked out, but…
David Sasnett: They really haven’t given us response on that yet, Gerry.
Gerry Sweeney: Okay. So they’ve been a little bit quiet. What about other potential assets? I think you own the land. I think that’s on the balance sheet in around $21 million. If my – I read it a little while ago, but is there an opportunity to monetize any of the assets other than some of that non-recoverable amount that you submitted?
David Sasnett: No, there’s nothing. We have some receivables that are due from the government that we’re collecting and the ordinary course of business, value added receivables that, and then we had the land. That’s it.
Gerry Sweeney: Yeah, I mean, but the land is separate from that $56 million, I should say, right.
David Sasnett: No, no.
Rick McTaggart: No, no. That’s included Gerry. It’s just – 
Gerry Sweeney: It’s included.
Rick McTaggart: We follow in parallel path by listing a land for sale, so if we can get that sold earlier than that comes out of the claim.
Gerry Sweeney: Got it, perfect. Okay, great. That’s it for me. That’s very helpful.  Thank you.
Operator:  The next question is from John Bair with Ascend Wealth Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Bair: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call here. Could you shed some more information on the geographical footprint of PERC? And are there markets is it expanding any, in other words, the geographical reach of them and see more opportunities outside of their current primary markets?
Rick McTaggart: Yes. So, their primary contracts are in California. They have other contracts in Arizona. We’re working on projects with them in Oregon, additional projects in California. We’re trying to get them into the Florida market. We’re working with them here out of the Coral Springs office and out of our Aerex facility in Fort Pierce to pursue some opportunities that we see here in Florida that would fit well with them. So that’s kind of what we’re looking at the moment. I mean we see some additional opportunities in Arizona. We’re working on some projects there. I think that pretty much covers it. The California is the primary market.
John Bair: Right.
David Sasnett: John, there – it’s a pretty active market, both California and Arizona. We’re also looking at the project too in Utah. So, we’re very encouraged by the prospects for. There’s a lot going on in that area of our business.
John Bair: With the municipalities being impacted by COVID and so forth, are you seeing any – you’re saying it’s active, but are you seeing any hesitation or push out on proposed projects or whatnot? And do you have any sense as to I mean, everybody’s talking about an infrastructure bill, it’s going to be coming out and so on and so forth, and imagine that there could be some benefits there for you.
Rick McTaggart: Yes. So, because PERC does operations, contracts and design build. And as David mentioned earlier, I mean at the moment, most of the revenues are from the operating contracts. So that the troubles with the municipalities is actually in my view, help PERC to get some of these extensions on the operating contracts and to – we have opportunities to get new operating contracts with municipalities that may be cash strapped and are trying to optimize limited resources. The design build stuff for sure has slowed down a little bit and that’s reflected in the fact that we don’t have any major design build projects going right now this year. So we’re trying to make up for certain lacks – lacking in the markets and with other areas such as the operations contracts, which we see as a positive growth area right now.
John Bair: Okay. And with those tight budgets, are they try to chip away on the terms of – on contract renewals and so forth to where you’re being pressured at all in that regards?
Rick McTaggart: Well, there is always some pressure, I mean, municipalities they’ll talk about going to rebid and that sort of thing. So we’ve had to negotiate on some of them, but nothing, I would say significant. I mean, I think we’re already pretty, cost effective to these places versus operating the facilities themselves. So, I haven’t seen a real tightening in the margin on these renewals this year. Nothing material.
John Bair: Okay. And last question any – it sounds like you’re pretty much focusing on the Southwest part of the U.S. What about any potential internationally, pretty much focusing on the U.S. business at this point?
Rick McTaggart: Nothing international at the moment. We look at the Caribbean, but the pandemic has really made it challenging to even move around to some of these places. So, we’re just focusing on the U.S. right now, primarily.
John Bair: Good. Very good. Good luck with trying to get Rosarito behind us.
Rick McTaggart: Thank you very much, John.
John Bair: Have a good holidays. Take care.
Rick McTaggart: You too.
Operator:  The next question is a follow-up from Gerry Sweeney with ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.
Gerry Sweeney: Hey, just wanted to follow-up, since – put a space there. Are you looking at any acquisitions still, any comments on that front?
Rick McTaggart: We’re always looking at acquisitions, Gerry. We got a couple of things that we’re looking at now. And we’ll keep everybody posted if that develops, but some pretty exciting stuff in my view.
Gerry Sweeney: Okay. I didn’t mean to think that you weren’t looking, so I apologize. But, are they more U.S.-based just out of curious, if you can give a little bit of…
Rick McTaggart: Yes.
Gerry Sweeney: Got it. I won’t put around too much, but I appreciate it. Thanks, Rick.
Operator: At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to now turn the call back over to Mr. McTaggart. Sir, please go ahead.
