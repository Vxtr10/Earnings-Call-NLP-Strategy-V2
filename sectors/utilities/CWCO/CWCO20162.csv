I would now like to turn the conference o David Sasnett, Executive Vice President CFO and Director. Mr. Sasnett, the floor is yours sir.
David Sasnett: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining me on our second quarter conference call. In a departure from our usual procedure, I’ll be the speaker today rather than CEO, Rick McTaggart. Rick will not be able to join us on the call this morning because he’s presently in Mexico and engaged along with officials from the state of Baja, California, various Mexican governmental agencies and our consortium partners in the process of finalizing the public-private partnership agreement for our proposed Rosarito project. Kind of this project is of great interest to all of our investors, and I’ll update you – where we stand at the end of this call. Gross profit dollars for each of our three business segments this quarter increased as compared to 2015, which resulted in a total gross profit increase of about $627,000 for the quarter over 2015 or 11% compared to the same period of last year. I think the gross profit dollars this quarter emphasizes the testament to the quality of our core operations. However, we incurred higher legal costs this quarter as a result of litigation in Mexico, and we have non-cash amortization charges related to our February 2016 acquisition of 51% of the equity of Aerex Industries. That resulted in net income this quarter that was relatively consistent with that of the second quarter of 2015 at $2.2 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Turning to the performance of each of our segments. Our retail segment contributed just over $700,000 to our income from operations this quarter compared to about $760,000 in the same quarter last year. Our revenues in the retail segment increased 2% despite a 4.4% downward rate adjustment that was made the first quarter this year to our rates due to the downward movement in the price indices that are used as a basis for such rate adjustment. The increase in our water volume sold was about 10% for the retail segment this quarter, but about 40% of this volume increase is due to unusually high demand for one customer. We are not sure if this demand is recurring or it’s just a one quarter situation. And with respect to our retail license, we’ve been greatly encouraged with the progress we’ve made with respect to our negotiations for the renewal of this license with the Cayman Islands Water Authority since those negotiations recommenced during the third quarter last year. While there are a couple of important differences that have yet to be resolved with the water authority, we believe these negotiations could be concluded by the end of this year. With respect our Bulk segment, our Bulk segment contributed about $2.2 million to our income from operations this quarter, about the same amount as the second quarter of last year. You’ll note that our Bulk segment revenues were down approximately $800,000 this quarter, but that decrease in revenue is strictly due to changes in energy prices. Our bulk contracts are set up so that we pass energy charges through to our customers. And as those charges drop, our revenues drop. But it’s important to note that our gross profit is very healthy at about the same level of last year, $2.6 million. And our gross profit as a percentage of revenues has actually increased to about 35% as compared to 31% of last year. With respect our Services segment, our newly acquired Aerex subsidiary contributed approximately $1.3 million in revenues to our Services segment this past quarter. Aerex is an original equipment manufacturer of a wide range of products and services applicable to the water industry. But as a result, its revenues and earnings are dependent upon the timing and size of its purchase orders, and while their financial performance during the four months following our acquisition of Aerex is not being consistent with what they’ve did in 2015. We remain very positive about the contribution that Aerex will make in our Company. It’s also important to note that our Services segment generated incremental revenues and gross profit during the quarter from project to refurbish the Grand Cayman’s Islands Water Authority North Sound plant. Now I would like to turn things to a discussion of the Rosarito project. We are very pleased to announce that on June 15 of 2016, the state of Baja California designated the consortium comprised of our subsidiary, N.S.C. Agua S.A. de C.V., NuWater and Degremont S.A. de C.V., The Consortium, as the winner of the tender process for the project that we’ve been pursuing, literally, for the last six years and set August 15, 2016, as the deadline for the negotiation of the definitive public-private partnership agreement for the consortium. While we still have several tasks to complete before we can start construction on the project, and these tasks include finalizing and executing an acceptable definitive public-private partnership agreement with the state, and also finalizing the funding arrangements for the project. We obviously are very confident and optimistic that we’ll be able to proceed with construction. I do think it’s important to know that there are certain things that are sort of out of our control with respect to this project, things that have to be done, sort of, by the state, that aren’t in our control. We’ve pointed these things out in our public filings. They include the fact that the state must establish and register various payments for us and guarantees the bank credit lines for the specific use by the project. That the CEA in Mexico must retain the rights from the relevant federal authority to take in and desalinate the sea water and distribute it for municipal use. Various water purchase and sales agreements between CA, The Payment Trust, and the Tijuana, Mexico municipality have to be executed and a permit has to be obtained from the relevant federal authority to discharge the residual water from the permits – from the project’s desalination plant. And, of course, we have to raise the financing. But obviously, we’re very optimistic that all these conditions will be met and that we’ll be able to proceed with the project. And with that, I’d like to turn the call over to questions. So, Mike?
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gerry Sweeney of Roth Capital.
Gerard Sweeney: Hey, good morning David. How are you?
David Sasnett: Good morning, Gerard.
Gerard Sweeney: A quick question on the retail. You said it was up – Bahamas was up about 10%, 3% coming from one customer. The other 7%, is this driven by increased tourism? I don’t want to say permanent, but do you have some clarity on is this volume going to stay in place as we go forward? You know, the seasonality aside, but want to see, what was the driver of the increase was?
David Sasnett: Gerry, the biggest determinant of our retail sales really is the weather. If we have a lot of rain on Grand Cayman, people don’t use as much water. But if it doesn’t rain as much, obviously, they’ve got to buy water from us. The secondary factor in determining retail sales is tourism and the level of activity on the island and, of course, that’s seasonal. So really, it’s very difficult to project what’s going to happen with our retail volume, because you really can’t predict the weather.
Gerard Sweeney: Okay, that’s fair enough. And then switching over to the services side. Obviously Aerex, I think it is something like $19 million last year. You guys did indicate that sales would be different and they could be lumpy. Are you looking - or would you be in a position at some point in the future to provide, maybe some backlog numbers for the company on a go forward basis, so we can get a little bit more visibility into the business?
David Sasnett: Yes, I think as we become more comfortable with the company, and - we would be able to provide some backlog information. But I don’t think their projects - really of a long-term nature that take several months. So the backlog is typically - it’s rather short. This business is cyclical. They - that’s just the nature of the business and so, we don’t view the current level of activity with Aerex indicative of what they’ll do in the future, obviously. We’re very confident about the contribution this company is going to make to our consolidated operations, very happy to have a 51% interest in Aerex.
Gerard Sweeney: Got it. And then finally, just real quick on Rosarito. I know there’s some hurdles in place, so some, I guess, blocking and tackling with the agencies, that and [indiscernible] et cetera. But when - any idea if things go rather smoothly, when construction could start?
David Sasnett: Well, they said if you look at our public disclosures, the state’s set a date of August the 15th for finalizing the contract, but they have the right to extend that date. And as I mentioned earlier, Rick is in California and in Mexico, working on finalizing this contract with a large group of people, our consortium partners and a lot of government officials. We’ve provided all of our comments to the government on the agreement, so they’re working through that at the moment. We are hopeful that they can move forward with finalizing this agreement. If everything went well, we’d be looking at perhaps reaching some kind of financial close by the end of this year and starting construction next year. But I, obviously, the timing of all this is under the control of the state.
Gerard Sweeney: Understood. It’s totally fair. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot David. End of Q&A
Operator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, it appears that we have no further questions. We are going to conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Sasnett for any closing remarks. Sir?
David Sasnett: Thanks, guys, for participating, everyone, ladies and gentlemen, on our call this morning. We’ll talk to you next quarter. Good-bye.
Operator: And we thank you for your time also today, sir. Again, the conference call has now concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you, take care, and have a great day, everyone."
