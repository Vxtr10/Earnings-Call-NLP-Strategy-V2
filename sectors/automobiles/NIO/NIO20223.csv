In the third quarter 2022 NIO delivered a total of 31,607 smart electrical vehicles, up 29.3% year-over-year setting a new quarterly high. Based on our latest technology platform, NT2.0, we have launched and delivered three new products, which has improved the competitiveness of our product line-up in all aspects and enabled NIO to enter more premium segments, catalyzing continuous demand growth. In October, overcoming the production and supply chain volatility, we delivered 10,059 vehicles, representing a 174.3% increase year-over-year. We will continue to collaborate closely with our supply chain partners to stabilize components supply and further accelerate the vehicle production and the delivery. We expect the total number of deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be between 43,000 to 48,000. Next, I would like to share some recent highlights of our R&D and operations. In September as the show cars of ET5, a smart electric midsize sedan began to be on display in our stores. Store traffic reached a record high and order intake witnessed its strong growth momentum. On September 30, we officially kicked off the delivery of ET5 and the preliminary user satisfaction rate exceeded our expectations.

Since we entered the Norwegian market last September, our products and services have been well received by local users and the user community has been growing rapidly, which has laid a solid foundation for and boosted our competency in entering more markets in Europe. On October 7 this year, we held NIO Berlin 2022 while we comprehensively introduced our products and services to users in Europe, marking of our official market entry in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. NIO Berlin drew a lot of attention and recommendation from users and the auto industry in Europe. We are now organizing larger scale test drives and kicked off user delivery in Europe.

Both of our products and innovative technology have been highly recognized by the users, industry experts and professional media in Europe. To better serve user communities in Europe, we plan to open new houses and new spaces in 10 major European cities such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Rotterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm. We also plan to install 20 power swap stations in Europe by the end - by the year end and another 100 by the end of 2023. So that more users can experience new chargeable, swappable and upgradable power system in Europe. In addition, we have established an R&D center in Berlin for localized development and deployment of digital cockpit and ADAS to continuously improve for the intelligent digital experience of local users. On September 27, NIO announced the cooperation with the Danish Society for Natural Conservation and Danish Nature Foundation under Clean Parks initiative.

In spite of the operation challenges brought forward by the changing micro environment, we believe that NIO is fully capable of staying focused on product and technology innovations, as well as its service capability improvement, while further optimizing the cost structure and improving operational efficiency to do more beyond the experience products and services to users worldwide. As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide you the financial details for the third quarter 2022. Over to you Steven.
Steven Feng: Thank you. I will now go over our key  for the third quarter of 2022. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I'll reference to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details. Our total revenues in the third quarter were RMB 13.0 billion, representing an increase of 32.6% year-over-year, and 26.3% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the third quarter were RMB 11.9 billion, representing increase of 38.2% year-over-year and 24.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to higher deliveries, as a result of more diversified product mix offered to our users. Other sales in the third quarter were RMB1.1 billion, representing a decrease of 8.5% year-over-year and an increase of 48.2% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in other sales year-over-year was mainly due to the decreased revenue derived from sales of automotive regulatory credits, offset by the increase in other revenues in line with the incremental vehicle sales. The increase in other sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the increased revenue derived from sales of automotive regulatory credits and increase in other revenues in line with the incremental vehicle sales. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2022 was 13.3%, compared with 20.3% in the third quarter of 2021 and 13.0% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease of gross margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to first, the decreased revenue derived from sales of automotive regulatory credits with high sales margin, second, the decrease of vehicle margin, and third the reduction in other sales margin resulting from expanding investment in power and service network. The increase of gross margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the sales of automotive regulatory credits with high sales margin. More specifically, vehicle margin in the third quarter was 16.4%, compared with 18.0% in the third quarter of 2021 and 16.7% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease of vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to the increased battery cost per unit, which was partially offset by the decrease in subsidization in user vehicle financing arrangements. Vehicle margin remained stable quarter-over-quarter. R&D expenses in the third quarter were RMB2.9 billion, representing an increase of 146.8% year-over-year and 37% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in R&D expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the increased personnel costs in research and development functions as well as the incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies. SG&A expenses in the third quarter were RMB2.7 billion, representing an increase of 48.6% year-over-year and 18.8% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to, first, the increase in personnel costs related to sales and general corporate functions, second, increased expenses related to the Companyâs sales and service network expansion, third, increase in marketing and promotional activities to promote our vehicles in China and Europe. Loss from operations in the third quarter was RMB3.9 billion, representing an increase of 290.2% year-over-year and 36.0% quarter-over-quarter. Other losses, net in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB495.6 million, representing an increase of RMB528.2 million from other income of RMB32.6 million in the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of RMB305.6 million from the second quarter of 2022. The increase of other losses over the third quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the loss from the revaluation of our overseas RMB-related assets as a result of the depreciation of RMB against U.S. dollars in the third quarter of 2022. Net loss in the third quarter was RMB4.1 billion, representing an increase of 392.1% year-over-year and 49.1% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIOâs ordinary shareholders in the third quarter was RMB 4.1 billion, representing an increase of 44.9% year-over-year 50.9% quarter-over-quarter. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investment and long-term time deposits were RMB51.4 billion as of September 30, 2022. Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session.
