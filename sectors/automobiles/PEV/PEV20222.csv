In addition to our vehicle lines, Phoenix also produces a wide range of affordable and reliable battery powered forklifts exposed best-in-class warranties. And finally, as one of the early as one of the early movers in the medium duty EV industry, we've experienced firsthand how infrastructure can be a barrier to the successful electrification of vehicles. As a result, we also offer products and services through our EV infrastructure solutions business, which targets both commercial and consumer customers, offering one stop shop solutions through a full charging infrastructure solution portfolio that extends beyond our clients to include the retail sector level one and level two chargers.  At its core, we're an engineering focused company with patented technologies to address the markets need for the next generation of pickup trucks, SUVs and commercial vehicles.

I want to now turn the call over to our CFO, Chris Wang.
Chris Wang: Thank you, Dr. Lance. Phoenix is not a pre revenue company like many others in our sector. We have a long history of making and delivering completed products for the total satisfaction of our customers. We have a stable and the loyal customer base. And then we provide a simple one stop shop solution for clients by offering vehicles, chargers and then complete service support. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, our revenues were $1.5 million compared to 653,000 for the same period in 2021.  Our total revenues increased by 130%, principally driven by the extended the sale off of forklifts during the recent quarter, but delivered to EVs during the second quarter of 2022 to the same as in the second quarter of 2021. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, our revenues were $2.2 million compared to $1.1 million in 2021. The 93% increase year revenues was primarily driven by the increase in the sales of a forklift. For the second quarter of 2022, our cost of revenues was $1.2 million, compared to $0.8 million in the year ago quarter. Cost of revenues increased by $400,000 or 45%, primarily driven by the cost of foreign forklift product, partially offset by lower direct costs associated with EVs due to higher efficiency in production during the recent quarter. For the six months, ended June 30, 2022, our cost of revenues was $1.7 million, up from $1.2 million driven by higher forklift costs.  Our gross margin comparisons are as follows. For this analysis, gross profit is defined as revenues minus cost of revenues, and the gross margin percentage is gross profit divided by revenues. For the second quarter of 2022, our gross margin improved significantly to 21.7% from negative 24.3% in the year ago quarter, driven by improved the margins across all product categories, particularly attributable for the 19.2% gross margin of a forklift product. For the six months, and then, during 2022, funded to our gross margin similarly improve that to 20.5% from negative 9.5%. Again, driven by improved the margins across all product categories.  Operating expenses, consisting of SG&A expenses, or $2.3 million in the most recent quarter, compared with 1 million a year ago. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increases in payroll and expenses associated with becoming a public company. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, our operating expenses were $5.3 million, up from $4.1 million in 2021. The increase in operating expenses was driven by an increase in sales in salaries and the wages and the professional services fees and the insurance expenses. Our other income for the first six months of 2022 were $0.6 million, primarily due to the recognition of a forgiven PPP loan. As a result of the above factors, a net loss for the second quarter of 2022 was $1.9 million narrower than the last year is $2.3 million loss.  For the six months. For the first six months of 2022, a net was $4.2 million, the same as in the first half of 2021. As we diligently implement various measures to boost the revenue, and the control costs and expenses, were more excited than ever, about the bright and the green future of Phoenix. Thank you so much for joining our call today. I will turn it back over to Mark.
