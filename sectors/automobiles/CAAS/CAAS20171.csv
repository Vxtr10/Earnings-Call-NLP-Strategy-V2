Net sales of EPS, our electronic products declined to $29.8 million by $2.3 million. As a percent of net sales, sales of EPS products were 25.5% for the first quarter of 2017.

Sales to Fiat Chrysler North America continue to grow as well as to Ford North America. Our Brazilian assembly plant continues to ramp up its assembly operations to serve our global Tier-1 customers in Brazil, in Chinese OEMs operating in the region. As we expand our global reach international sales are expected to become a greater proportion of our total sales in the future. We continue to invest in businesses to maintain our leadership in Chinese steering market.

These investments were primarily for EPS development and trials as well as development of other link products, we continue to purchase advanced manufacturing equipment, a newly developed products, hiring senior technicians and actively seeking external technical support.

In the first quarter of 2017 net sales were $119.3 million comparing to $116.9 million in the same quarter of 2016 reflecting a 2.1% year-over-year growth.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from William Gregozeski from Greenridge Global. You may begin.
William Gregozeski: Hi, I got a couple of questions. You guys talked about the EPS demand exceeding your capacity for a while and the sales were down this quarter - year-over-year, can you just talk a little more why that was the case?
Qizhou Wu: [Interpreted] Yes, it was due to the recall one of our OEM customer we have been made an announcement earlier that was a recall by our OEM customer time. But after a number of discussions, which we're now back on track, I think the order was start flowing - starting from second quarter. And so that was the reason first quarter was big weak and due to this large customer.
William Gregozeski: Okay. Can you give us update on how things are going in Brazil?
Qizhou Wu: [Interpreted] Okay. So for Brazil our first production line is up and running and we're expecting to produce 120,000 units in 2017. The main product from that facility though be manual steering gears, we're expecting 60 million RMB in USD - in sales, in revenue and 60 million RMB.
William Gregozeski: Okay, all right. And last question was looks like you guys took $29 million loan and one that two a related party, it was classified as advanced payment through related on the balance sheet for a long and the cash flow statement, so I just wanted to get some more information on what that was and what - I want to know what that $29 million was for?
Qizhou Wu: So for that particular related party transaction we see - given us a line of credit which we can draw down at relatively lower rates. So our costs for those - interest costs for the mark will be four point something percent new rate when we loan to related party for that transaction will be charging six point something percent interest, so its relating transaction, but it's also we're going to make money on that transaction.
William Gregozeski: Okay, so it's strictly just a vehicle to make interest spread?
Qizhou Wu: Okay.
William Gregozeski: Okay. And what's the length of that loan?
Qizhou Wu: [Interpreted] Okay. So it's a one year loan, but there is a special term the creditor can call back any time.
William Gregozeski: All right. That's all I have. Thanks guys.
Qizhou Wu: Okay, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Okay. Our next question is [indiscernible] Private Investor. You may begin.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you good morning. I had a question or two on revenue guidance for I guess this quarter, Q2, Q3, and Q4 I know you're targeting $485 million for the year, but if you look at the comparisons from last year Q2 and Q3 do you feel that this year your comparisons for Q2 and Q3 will be up maybe closer to 10% and maybe Q4, which was very strong last year might be lower. What's your view at this point?
Qizhou Wu: [Interpreted] Okay. So let me take it through the overall market dynamics. In 2017 it's been widely perceived the overall - all the market will grow about 5% in China. Within that segment you will see commercial vehicle will grow faster, so as a whole we'll see the growth will be around 10%. The commercial was mainly due to the government policy and the entire overloading situation in China and enforced by central government. And that's why we're seeing the growth has been quite strong since the fourth quarter of 2015 and we will see growth will continue in 2017. And in terms of passenger vehicle, we're seeing overall growth it's relatively smaller than the - what we have achieved in 2016 and also compared with the commercial vehicle growth in 2017. Reason being one the base is higher - the base is higher in 2016 and makes the comparable difficult to continue to achieve higher growth. And secondly the subsidy in 2016 is now being reduced in 2017 and subsidy is related to consumption tax for smaller vehicles and in 2015 it was given - it's a very generous discount for consumption tax for new car purchase for the smaller engine vehicles. However, that policy continued, but it's in the smaller scale in 2017, so we'll see that the overall sales for passenger vehicle growth. Together we see 2017. First and second quarter is generally good, third quarter it's essentially somehow it's relatively flat and fourth quarter is last year 2016 was the strong quarter, so we think the year-over-year because of higher comp comparable is going to affect the year-over-year growth and so we'll see a growth would be relatively small.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And as far as u guess it's right to say, but year-over-year it was $0.75 for the full year in 2016 do you see the potential for 10% up maybe above 75%.
Qizhou Wu: [Interpreted] Okay, go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: No I'm done, go ahead.
Qizhou Wu: [Interpreted] Normally not giving the bottom line guidance, the net income guidance have already provided a top line guidance, but at the same time we also implement stringent cost control, expense control, so we'll make our best effort to reflect the revenue growth in the bottom line.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. I have last question. 2018 what's your forecast for I guess improvement in EPS and percentage of that business growing you're probably looking at transition of more vehicles into the EPS requirement what do you see for next year?
Qizhou Wu: [Interpreted] Well, due the recall in the first quarter which has reflected in 2017 first quarter, our EPS full year will come down a bit, because of first quarter based on the EPS sales to that particular life customers. So but overall we're still projecting EPS steering sales at 1.2 million units in 2017. For 2018 we're seeing around 20% year-over-year growth for the EPS product and we believe is our continue investment into R&D and product development and we'll achieve that goal.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Actually maybe I could ask one last question. Anything on buybacks I know you've completed what almost half the buyback, but your position on that as far as the share repurchase?
Qizhou Wu: [Interpreted] No plan right now. We'll make an announcement in a week to that point.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks for answering my questions.
Qizhou Wu: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Theiss for closing remarks.
