This represents an increase of 72.5% compared to last year, the sales volume in the China market was more than 988,000 units, nearly breaking 1 million units, but 72.7% year-over-year increase. Where the volume in an international market with just shy of 50,000 units, including nearly a 35,000 units of mopeds, are 16% year-over-year increase an additional 15,000 kick-scooters. This is a milestone for us as a product company and local brands. From a product company standpoint, despite all the global supply chain issues and the COVID-19 situation, the grow of volume by 72% while also expanding into new product categories. 4:14 From a brand perspective, we're now the leading urban mobility company in more than 50 countries around the world with 4,000 plus retail and online shops. The strong growth in 2021 is a test for the implementation of our 2.0 growth strategy, which is leveraging our design technology to create electric urban mobility solutions, suitable for 2 regions and market segments and in return making you a global urban mobility breath. So for last year, we spoke the 5 key markets and events our product portfolio in those. The China electric bicycle market and the electric motorcycle market, the international electric motorcycle market, the kick-scooter market and also the e-bike market for Micromobility. 5:09 In 2021, we launched a total of 5 new products to the China electric bicycle market.  F2, F0, and C0 of the Gova series. Price between RMB3,099 to RMB7,999. Those 5 new product has been hit in each of their respective target markets accounted for 27% of our 2021 sales. Those 5 products enjoyed a handful upgrade to the smart connectivity and battery management system that combined with the new China national standard for electric bicycles. This allowed our customer to enjoy a more connected part experience while benefiting from enhanced battery performance by adding extended right range from 40 kilometers to 80 kilometers on a single charge. 6:03 Meeting multiple consumer segments mobility needs. This has been a key for us to a happy to even larger total addressable  market in China. Also the electric motorcycle market in China, we have expanded upon the upgraded Gova G3 and Gova F4. The upgraded G3 now has a range of over 100 kilometers on a single charge, it has been well received by the market and  close to 6% of our 2021 sales, it just a few months in a year. 6:39 For Europe and America's market -- motorcycle market, we introduce 3 new products our first Niu product and GT will the most powerful electric 125cc shipped in 2021, the RQi electric motorcycle and our first 150cc hybrid moped YQi both ships on 2022. Those three products represented our expansion into performance motor and motorcycles. Those product rich top speed over 100 kilometer per hour and each has exciting of 0 to 60 kilometer per our track sign, even all stripping is definitely power rivals. Those product offerings actually triple our dreadful motorcycle market overseas expanding from 50cc equivalent to ask 125cc equivalent. 7:36 In December alone right after the entity will ready for ship. We have shipped  Ladies and gentlemen your speaker is currently experiencing some technical difficulties with the line. Please stand by while we address the situation. Please continue speakers. No, hi, sorry, our signal just -- our phone got a pickup. So basically, let me just quickly talk about now with the 3 new electric motorcycle offerings were enabled by our continued investment in R&D, such as the upgraded powertrain system to increase the top the, up 200cc kilometer per hour. The upgraded battery system to increase dry range by 30% plus and the smart 2.0 features to add additional technology flash in the traditional motorcycle market. 9:44 Now as we mentioned during the last earnings call besides the scooter and motorcycle product, we have entered the Micromobility market with 2 new categories, the kick-scooter and the E-bikes. In 2021, we introduced the 2 new kick-scooter, the KQi3 and KQi2, a robust liable kick-scooter product with price starting from $549 to $899. Those products are pursued by their respective targets market and we shipped more than 15,000 units between September to December 2021. The release of those models is only the beginning and we have a handful of new models to launch in 2022 to meet the budget demands a wide range of customers who are looking for affordable solutions for their open commute. 10:34 Now for the e-bike market, we launched the BQi that has stylish urban minimalist design and is capable of extended ride range of 100 kilometers. thanks to add 2 removable batteries. The BQi will start from $1,500, making most powerful and affordable commuter effect to hit the market in 2022. We expect to launch more impact products we enhance our offerings across the European and American market before the end of 2022. Supported by the new product, a new category launched in the previous 3 quarters in 2021. We accelerated our sales network expansion the fourth quarter in 2021. In Q4, we launched 422 New branded flagship stores across China, bringing our total store count to 3,108 stores by the end of 2021. For the entire year, we added nearly 1,500 more stores doubling our total store count in China. 11:33 In addition, we have expanding to 40 new cities reaching a total coverage of nearly 240 cities in 2021. Those together with a wide range of offerings drove our growth in 2021 and also serve as strong base for 2022. For international market in 2021, we have increased our market coverage to 50 countries, with total 174 flagship and premium stores across the globe to form a dense sales network and bring better products or services to our customers. This is in addition to our more than 1,000 motorcycle e-mobility dealers cross 5 continents. 12:15 Now in addition to our offline store growth and thanks to launch our Micromobility products with successfully opened a new range of retail channels that previously were not ideal for electric mopeds scooters, including not only in the big box retail electronic chains like best buy medium mark, but also online platform like Amazon. Those new channels will accelerate sales while simultaneously expanding our brand recognition. 12:41 Now in order to support enhance the new 2.0 strategy for product store expansion, we have also expanded our branding and marketing activities to penetrate even deeper into the new markets. For China market will successfully wrapped the entire 2021 with a brand promotion station the field would be proud or be new in the year of art. Starting back in February 2021, we kicked off the Chinese New Year by launching the year new nationwide campaign, which generate more than 400 million views across multiple social platforms. 13:17 In October, we reached an important milestone become the first electric two wheeler brand to have our customers record a 10 billion kilometer riding distance. To celebrate such an event, we launched our 10 billion kilometer feel proud campaigns, which will also have an incredible rich, accumulating more than 1.4 billion views online offline around the world for the entire Q4. More importantly, it helps to convey our brand value to our friends, writers and future customers. The message is positioning you not just as an electric scooter company, but more importantly as a lifestyle brand. 13:57 In the international market. We'll also continue to deepen our effort in Q4 specifically with our social media effort with close to 1 million to actions across Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. We also attend EICMA in Milan, Italy November 2021. And the CES in Las Vegas in the United States in January 2022, to launch 5 new products receive 10 million plus impressions, with more than 100 articles published. This branding and marketing expert have significantly increased our brand awareness. Our recent survey in China has shown that we are going top 3 brand awareness significantly higher dollar market share position, which is currently a number 10. 14:43 As we wrapped up 2021, our most successful year so far, we feel very optimistic for 2022. For our addressable market in China, the continued implementation of China national standard for electric bicycle is helping to push the two-wheeler owners to convert to lithium battery powered electric bicycles even faster than orange no projections. As a leader in the China's smart lithium two-wheeler industry, we're out ahead our competitors and leaves this technology transformation. We continue to push our R&D and we'll find new models and a handful of existing product upgrades with maturity of those products that build from April to September in 2022 to this year. 15:29 In addition, we also observe a fast growth in the light of electric motorcycle market fuel by our enhanced dry range battery and powertrain solutions. We'll find new models in the sector with the first model go with the three price from RMB3,899 to RMB5,499 rolled out in March, and the rest of from April to September. Those new models will drive the main growth in the hot season in Q2 and Q3. 16:00 Now for overseas market investment in battery technology and powertrain technology last year has enabled the transformation from petrol to electric motorcycle for the mass commune market. i.e. the 125cc category. Our market leading advances coupled with our mature smart connectivity features has allowed us to stand out as a leader in all of the 50 plus market we have penetrated so far. For example, we rent a number one electric motor in Europe. And as we expand our power range beyond the lower power 50cc category into the 125cc categories, we instantly grow our total addressable market by 3x, our awkward MGT our newly  MGT-EVO, the RQi and YQi will be the main feature product for this year and we have additional two products in development. 16:57 Now at the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of ownership of Micromobility e-bike by kick-scooter. For short trips in communities around the globe, and especially in those market where new has been established and the trusted brands since 2016. Our first batch of kick-scooter products, the K3 and K2 have been a hit last year, and our PQi e-bike to be shipped in early Q2 2022 has also received very positive attentions. And where do we find new products in those categories in 2014, to see the market growth across all segments and take advantage our 100,000 plus points of sales across Europe and Americas. 17:42 Now supported by the suitable product and tech offerings. Our sales network expansion will also continue to be accelerated. We plan to add additional more than 1,000 new branded stores in 2022. Now starting Q4 last year and the continued Q1 2022, we have observed the raw material price continued to increase, for example, with lithium battery costs increased by 10% to 20%. We increased our product price by average 5% in March 2022 this year to cope with the raw material price increase. Together with our R&D effort and cost reduction, we will maintain a healthy gross margin with this 5% price increase. For the international product we also plan to increase price in April. So all those prices increase the full impact our gross margin will be fully reflected in Q2 this year. Now with all those effort under the way we're very optimistic with this year's growth targeting annual sales volume between 1.5 million to 1.7 million vehicles for the entire year of 2022. Now I'll turn the call over to Fion to discuss our financial results. Fion?
Fion Zhou: 18:55 Thank you, Yan. And hello everyone. Our press release contains all the figures and comparisons you need. And we have also uploaded Excel format figures to our IR website for your easy reference. And I’ve reviewed our financial performance and we are referring to the fourth quarter figures unless I say otherwise. And that all mandatory figures are RMB unless otherwise noted. 19:21 I will quickly goes through the sales volume which Dr. Yan just mentioned. And our quarter four sales volume reached 230,000 units representing a 58.3% year-over-year growth and China sales volume increased by 49% primarily driven by the new product launches in the past 3 quarters and international business performed extremely well in quarter four, and over 18,000 e-scooters and nearly 15,000 kick-scooters delivered in quarter four and international sales volume exceeds our initial expectation. And the main reason causes is the ease of the international shipping gradually. With regard to the product mix, in China market, the proportion of NMU series rebounded from 24% to 47%. And correspondingly, global products accounted for the rest of 53%. Out of the 53% of global products 24% was from the entry level models, G0, F0 and C0 and the remaining 29% was from other Gova models with higher retail prices. 20:42 The overall product mix for China market improved this quarter to the premium models. Here I am referring to both NMU series and all non-zero Gova models, to go heavier proportion of 76% compared to 58% in quarter three. And for international market, we achieved around 33,000 deliveries in quarter four, with e-motorcycles and EMO path, accounting for 55% of them and kick-scooters accounting for 45%. 21:21 Total Revenue in quarter four were RMB986 million exceeding top line guidance provided in third quarter and up by 46.7% year-over-year. This growth was attributable to increase the sales volume across our domestic and international segments, particularly an increase of 156% for international deliveries, I mentioned before, and revenue for international e-motorcycles and EMO has rebounded after quarter three 2021, rose by 2.7x to RMB156,000, 35% of year-over-year, and revenue from kick-scooters soured by over 29 times, compared to quarter three and revenue from China, the e-scooter sales remained strong and increased by 48% year-over-year. The accessory spare parts and services revenue also increased by more than 20% year-over-year, though partially offset by 7.3 decrease in overall revenue for scooters. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our total revenue increased 51.6% to RMB3.7 billion as compared to RMB2.4 billion in 2020. 22:54 Now let's look at our ASP. The overall ASP in quarter four declined by 7.3% year-over-year, but improved by 34% quarter-over-quarter. In China market, the E-scooters ASP remained almost the same, compared to quarter four 2020 with a slight decrease by 0.9% from RMB3,355 to RMB3,326, while improved 21% significantly quarter-over-quarter. And the E scooters ASP from international market decreased 36% year-over-year, from RMB8,979 to RMB5,749 and the key reason for the decline was the change in the product mix nearly 15,000 units sold of the kick-scooters affected our international ASP to a large extent, who's those -- whose sales price is lower than the e-motorcycles and EMO has priced. 24:07 And if we take how the impact of kick-scooters, international ASP decrease was only around 3% year-over-year and in terms of number is 8,678, so in total, the ASP of e-scooters was only 4.6% decrease. And the ASP of accessories spare parts and services was 479 per scooter decreasing by 24% year-over-year, mainly because of acceleration in the expansion of sales volume. The gross margin quarter four was 22.6%, 2.6% percentage points lower than the same period last year, while 2.6 percentage points higher than last quarter and the decrease year over year was the consequence of higher raw material costs and changing products mix and the raw material costs are remain at the elevated level in the fourth quarter. And we were still experiencing additional inflation in the international shipping. 25:22 And the cost inflation has reduced our margin by around 1.9 percentage points. While product mix enlarge this impact by 0.7 percentage points. To combat the cost inflation, we increase domestic scooter retail price from March 2022, and international scooters retail price from April 2022 and we continue to aggressively manage all aspects of our cost structure, including the advanced technology to product body and purchase agreements to secure sustainable suppliers of the key components parts and other cost saving initiatives. 26:09 Our total operating expenses excluding share based compensation were RMB176.2 million, increased by RMB66.5 million or 60.6 percentage year-over-year and increase with cost by RMB17.3 million higher branding and advertisement in sales and marketing expenses and RMB13.2 million higher depreciation expenses of the new store openings and RMB9.7 million higher staff costs, expressed as percentage of revenue, our operating expenses exclude share-based compensation was 17.9%, 1.6 percentage point higher than quarter four last year, mainly caused by the retail sales network expansion and branding and marketing activities. 27:14 And we believe there was no better time for retail sales network expansion and brand marketing than now to gain more ground. Extending the fast growing lithium-ion battery power to witter market segments. And a series of marketing activities were launched in fourth quarter as ramping up the branding, like National Wild campaign 10 billion kilometers of riding, as Dr. Li just mentioned, and city promotions, which were targeted to those cities forced to implement the new national standards in 2022. 27:51 I'd also like to add that although our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in quarter four increase to 1.6 percentage points. Our annual non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue maintain the same level as last year at 15.2%. Furthermore our annual GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenue decreased from 16.8% to 16.4% and we are in a good position to leverage our brand awareness, retail sales network expansion and our total operating expenses at a healthy level. 28:38 Our GAAP net income was RMB47.6 million and net margin was 4.8%. Their adjusted net income was RMB60.2 million and adjusted net margin was 6.1%, 4.1 percentage point lower year-over-year. As mentioned above, these were briefly due to 2.6 percentage points gross margin decline and 1.6 percentage points operating expenses increase. And for the year ended December 31, 2021, our net income was RMB225.8 million and adjusted net income was RMB273 million and our net margin was 6.1%, decrease slightly by 0.8 percentage point and our adjusted net margin was 7.4% decreased by 1.1 percentage points, and the decrease mainly came from the decline in the gross margin. 29:50 Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with RMB1.1 billion in cash term deposits and short-term investments, excluding the restricted cash and our operating cash outflow RMB340 million mainly due to the reduction in payable of RMB214 million an increase in receivables as a result of seasonality. On the full year basis, our Operating cash flow was positive RMB334 million. Our quarter four cash CapEx was around RMB63 million, almost mostly related to capacity expansion of RMB27 million and new source buildings of RMB36 million. 30:40 And now let's turn to guidance. We expect the fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of RMB647 million to RMB712 million, an increase of 20% to 30% year-over-year. And with that, now, let's open the call for the question that you may have for us. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: 31:05 Thank you.  First question comes from the line of Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Please ask your question?
BinWang: 31:34 Thank you management. I actually got two questions, number one is about cash about the first two months sales performance because we already in the beginning of March was the growth and roughly volume and second is that on about a full-year volume, can I have roughly breakdown, how much came from M, N, and Gova? Thank you.
Fion Zhou: 31:56 Okay, I'll answer this question. For the first 2 months in this year, we already got the sales order around above RMB100,000 in total, including domestic and international sales orders. And the sales volume we delivered in the first two quarters is RMB78,000, including the kick-scooters around 12,000 and the other are the new motorcycles and EMO paths are globally including domestic and international market. 32:34 And for the guidance in 2022, we expected around 1.3 to 1.4 sales units in the China market. And we expected around 300,000 -- sorry 200,000 units to 300,000 units in the international market. And as to the a product mix, we expected the NMU compares to the Gova series is around three versus seven and I -- within the Gova series, actually we expected the majority of the of the Gova series, the Gova premium products other than the entry level one. Hope I'd answered the questions for you.
Bin Wang: 33:29 Great, thank you.
Operator: 33:30 Thank you. Our next question comes from Jing Chang from CICC. Please ask a question.
Jing Chang: 33:40 Hi, hello, Yan. Hello, Fion. Thanks for your detailed illustration for the results. So, I have major 2 questions. The first is about further question about the product structure. So we can see it as a proportional for Gova zero series in last year fluctuated gradually, so from 20% to 40%. And just mentioned your -- maybe satisfying product structure, we expect this year, we can see that customers are still very price sensitive. So, if we want to achieve a stable, relatively high proportion of need to high end products, how we can achieve much stronger product differentiation for our maybe higher priced products or this is my first question. And a second -- a second is about the extent we can see that SG and an expense ratio costs are high in the fourth quarter. Looking at the ratios, selling expense ratio increases a lot,  comes from increasing advertising and promotion expense and also the increase in amortization of store expansion. So how can we expect overall expense ratio or the amount this year and how can aid reflect a strong -- stronger skill effect, that means better we can see the expense ratios go down this year. This is my two questions. Thank you.
Yan Li: 35:23 Yeah. So both of your questions, so let me address the first one and I would let Fion to talk about the expense part. So I think the great observation on the zero series for the entry level. So in last year 2021, we do see the fluctuation because we actually, we announced the F0, we lower the C0 product. So it's actually coupled with the new product low-out of the 0 series along with some of the promotions. So looking at 2022, so far we have one only one zero entry product to be rolled out that was a B0, which is actually closer, effectively end of March, then the rest of Gova products more on the two series, the D2, also on the six series, which are not showing there, the G6, also the C3 and the C6. So mostly more -- more towards the high end and an entry level. 36:25 The -- keep it in mind that, a lot of those entry level models are priced low because they have a relatively shorter dry range. So from actually from users perspective, it's actually users prefer what are called the mid-price levels, basically somewhere around RMB4000, but give a good dry range. For example, our T3C actually represents a low is your last year  4 months, actually already represents 6% of sales. And that product has a driver in 100 kilometers. So, I just want to make a point that we don't really it's not like hey the cheaper the better, it is actually you always have to look at the price versus the dry range. I think this year the focus on the goal of product more on the extended dry range product. And also I think this year, we have about three or four new models for the new series to be rolled out for China that will help to continue to try to increase for the higher basically our premium -- premium brand. So, I will let Fion to answer the second…
Jing Chang: 37:39 We appreciated, again.
Fion Zhou: 37:41 Okay, regarding to the sales and marketing expenses in quarter four. And actually, I already explained the nature of those sales and marketing expenses, the majority part are the branding and marketing activities and the rest are the depreciation and amortization expenses related to the new stores opening and if you look at the absolute figure is around RMB100 million sales and marketing expenses in quarter four, almost a one-thirds of the total whole year's sales and marketing expenses. Actually, this is the -- this quarter by the new stores opening during the whole year and you will see the full effect in quarter four, because we opened more than -- more than 15,000 new stores this year almost doubled compared to the to the year end in 2020 and that -- that is the that is the main reason. 38:45 And regarding to the -- actually regarding to the operating expenses ratio, especially the sales expenses ratio for this year. Since we already got the scale of our economy in the G&A and almost in the R&D Considering the different new models and we are about to deliver for the next year for the next 2 to 3 years. Actually we think the R&D expenses and G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue, we will lower around 0.2 percentage points and  sales and marketing expenses we will remain to 8% to 9% as a percentage of revenue for this year. So in total, we may remain the operating expenses ratio around 15% to 16% for this year, because we are still in the process of growing the China sales marketing channel for the -- for the offline sales volume this year and as Niu – Niu as always, we are the premium brands in China and in the international markets. We will take the – this window to improve the brand awareness globally, but we may keep the expenses at the -- at a healthy level.
Jing Chang: 40:23 Okay, forget it. Very clear. And that's all my questions. Yeah.
Fion Zhou: 40:29 Okay. Thank you.
Operator: 40:31 Thank you. Our next question comes from Wei Shen from UBS. Please ask your question.
Wei Shen: 40:37 Hi, Li. Hi Fion. My question is about the gross margin, we understand that battery prices, the lithium battery price has been running in recent weeks. I'm wondering, what's your strategy for that, where you further increase the mix of the lead acid battery in 2022. And I also understand that you have raised price by the maybe 200. Well, at covered the battery cost, inflate cost and when you consider another round of price hike, thanks.
Yan Li: 41:22 Yes. So I think let me address that. So we actually seeing last quarter we see the lithium battery price increase a bit, but then actually, really, at any starting January this year, we're starting to lithium battery to really shoot up. So we have seen some cases, the lithium battery price increased by almost 20% and also the P battery price also increased by 15%. So keep in mind, the battery -- the battery cost is roughly about 30% of our revenue to that extent. So now we increase our price by 5%, but really, in order to maintain still maintain the same margin, we have also done some cost reductions in terms of the chassis, to able to manage to maintain the same healthy margin, same time not increase the price too much. So I think that's one. 42:20 So, we actually look at the market. So, in front of market, we have observed that our competitors, so in the industry, people increase the lithium scooters, or moped price by up to from anywhere between 8% to 10%. So actually a significant higher than what we have done. So that means one, we do have additional room to increase the price, we have to really to observe the future, battery price increases. 42:52 And the second, we're also exploring and looking at some of the further electric bicycle solutions is difficult to do the last set, but also for the light electric motorcycles solutions in China. In some of the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. We also look at the graphite, what we call the graphite, lead acid battery solutions as a viable solution for those like motorcycles. And so we will have more than a few products in that range to really to come back with a lithium battery increases, price increases.
Wei Shen: 43:32 Can I confirm with you that as you raise price by 200, which only covered the price hike of today, from the end of 2021. Till now, about the gross margin will remain. If everything is -- other items are flat, the gross margin in the first quarter will be similar -- at a similar level of the fourth quarter of last year, which is still lower than that this quarter.
Yan Li: 44:09 So I think the gross margin questions are also related to the product mix as well. So let's say even keep the same product mix. It's similar -- it's actually has the gross margin has also slightly increased. So let me put it this way. The gross margin post price increase versus the gross margin before the price increase. The gross margin actually will improve by almost one percentage point, anyway keep the product mixing. 44:40 The product mix, mainly I talked about the international sales versus China sales also kick-scooter sales versus other stuff. But for the -- I think -- I think, we talked about for the entire year, we're still very optimistic that we're able to get to grow, on average get a gross margin somewhere between around 22%.
Wei Shen: 45:05 Okay, thank you.
Operator: 45:08 Thank you. . No further question. I'll turn the call back to management team for closing remarks.
Unidentified Company Representative: 45:53 Okay. Thank you, operator and thank you all for participating on today's call and for your support. We appreciate your interest. I look forward to reporting to you again next quarter on progress. Back to your operator.
Operator: 46:05 Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect."
