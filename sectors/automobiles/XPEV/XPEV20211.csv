"Operator: Hello ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by for the First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference call for XPeng Incorporated. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the management's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Today's conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. Zilin Ma  Director of Investor Relations of the company. Please go ahead Mr. Ma.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to the XPeng's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Our financial and operating results were issued by newswire services earlier today and are available online. You can also view the earnings press release by visiting the IR section of our website at ir.xiaopeng.com.
Xiaopeng He: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining XPeng's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call today. Heading into 2021, the electrification as modification are accelerating the disruption of internal combustion vehicles. Notably in much the penetration rate of high energy passenger vehicles in China surpassed the 10% threshold for the first time. The EV adoption in top tier cities experienced a record high growth with the penetration rate reaching around 20%. Being part of this unprecedented disruption opportunity, I strongly believe that XPeng is well poised to lead the development and transformation of the industry. My belief is firmly underpinned by our long-term strategic investment and the leadership in smart EV technology that we have been building out over the past years. Our strong momentum continued in the first quarter of 2021 with another quarter of record vehicle deliveries, despite traditionally slower season demand and challenges of industry-wide chip shortage. Our total vehicle delivery number in the first quarter reached 13,340, representing a 487.4% year-over-year increase consisting of 5,366 G3s and 7,974 P7.
Dennis Lu: Thank you, Xiaopeng He. Hello, everyone. XPeng's robust performance in the first quarter of 2021 demonstrates our strong capability to make differentiated Smart EVs that appeal to various needs of the large and growing customer base. Thanks to our record-breaking deliveries in the traditional weak season. In Q1, we witnessed the quarter-over-quarter increase in our top line and further improvement in our profitability. In particular, our gross margin continued an upward trend sequentially, hitting double-digits in the quarter. Additionally, for the first time revenue from our XPILOT software were recognized in top line and reflecting in gross margin, making a significant milestone in our Chinese EV industry. Moreover, our sound financial condition and strong cash position enable us to better execute our growth strategies, cement competitive advantages and seize tremendous growth opportunity in the Smart TV sector. Now I would like to walk you through our detailed financials for the first quarter of 2021. Total revenues were RMB2.95 billion for the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 616% from RMB412 million for the same period a year ago, and an increase of 3.5% from RMB2.85 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. Revenues from vehicle sales were RMB2.81 billion for the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 655% from RMB372 million for the same period of 2020, and an increase of 2.7% from RMB2.74 billion for the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase were primarily due to delivery of the P7, which started at the end of June last year.
Operator:  The first question comes from the line of Jeff Chung with Citi.
Jeff Chung: Hi, excellent results. This is Jeff from Citi. So I have two questions. The first question is about the software. Can you break down software revenue and gross profit in first quarter this year? More specific, how much software revenue was derived from first quarter this year and how much from the rest of the 2020 ended GP margin? How should we see this software income and profitability in the second quarter and the second half? This is my first question. Second question is about the vehicle GP margin. It seems that the G3 equipping with the LFP is accretive  to the GP margin. So how much faster compared with the LCM battery? Secondly, in the 1Q announcement, you mentioned that the first quarter cost of goods sold came down Q-o-Q due to lower material costs. Could you quantify a bit in terms of what kind of materials leading to lower cost and how would you see the cost trend into the second quarter?
Dennis Lu: Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Very good questions. I will try to handle the questions and then Brian or Charles or Xiaopeng He can supplement later. Number one is the software. Actually, in Q1, our total revenue from the XPILOT 3.0 software was about RMB80 million. Among that some RMB50 million was from those contracts we purchased -- the customer purchased last year and the other of around RMB30 million is from those software we sold this year. So, in general, the software accounts for about 2.5 percentage points of the margin. Among the 2.5 points, 1.5 will be contributed from those contracts we sold last year. And the other 1 percentage point is from those contract we sold in the first quarter because we have very good NGP skin from the Guangzhou to Beijing. We are seeing the software and also the hardware for the XPILOT is increasing actually in March and also in April. So we foresee the software penetration will be even higher in the second quarter. But again in the first quarter the total revenue or the total margin includes around 3,000 units of those software we -- the customer purchased last year. So the second quarter, we're not as high as 2.5%, but definitely will be higher than 1 percentage points for the first quarter. That's number one. The second question is for the G3. Yes, in -- actually we have material advantage compared with the LFP battery versus the LCM battery. But I cannot tell you the exact number. We’ve seen, for example -- we maintain the same MSRP -- same available marketing. However, we have the better material cost. So that would improve our -- the G3 margin as well. We started the delivery of the RFP G3 in April. So we can -- we will foresee the margin improvement for G3 in the second quarter. And number three is for the material cost reduction. Yes, we have the material. Good news compared with the Q4. The good news is primarily from the battery cost reduction. We actually -- we negotiate with our battery supplier to get the battery cost reduction. That basically was the negotiation was completed earlier this year. So we have some material cost reduction. The percentage will be from 5% to 10% in terms of the cost reduction versus the level at the end of last year. I hope I answer your questions.
Jeff Chung: Thank you. No more questions. Thank you
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Edison Yu with Deutsche Bank.
Edison Yu: Thank you and congrats on the quarter. First question is, could you give us an update on the LiDAR testing and validation with Livox? Is it meeting your performance requirements? And are you confident that the P5 with a LiDAR on it will be hitting the streets in the fourth quarter? And then second question is on the reservation number. I know you disclosed it shortly after the release. Could you maybe provide us an update? And if it's not the exact number I know you don't give that, but some sense of relative to your own expectations. How much higher is this number tracking? I will translate.
Xiaopeng He: So we’ve the tested multiple LiDARs of different brands and we compare them by different parameters in terms of their human cost craftsmanship, their costs and also their capability of being mass-produced. And so the LIDAR we use on P5 is actually DJI, Da-Jiang and we are very open to other options. So by 2022 to 2023 the new models that we are launching may adopt different brands that make -- that produce LiDARs. So basically we're very confident that right now with our capabilities of all around full spec sensing performance on our vehicles and also on our production capabilities, we can actually be complimentary to some of the LiDAR technology shortage for LiDAR technology disadvantage out there. However, in the long run we hope that we can achieve a good balance between the cost of the technology and the capability of being mass-produced, at the same time we can achieve a well-balanced amongst different performances across different parameters.
Xiaopeng He: So we are very confident that by Q4 this year we can launch P5 equipped with LiDAR. And regarding your second question about reservation number, obviously we can't disclose the exact number, but compared to P7 launch on the Shanghai Auto show last year in the same period, actually P5 reservation number is a few times more than that of P7.
Xiaopeng He: And also getting the feedback from our frontline sales force, the same periods last year when we first launched P7, they do feel some pressure from the market regarding the price of P7. However, this year with the launch of P5, every single feedback has been very positive regarding the launch of P5. So we're really confident that the actual performance in terms of orders and deliveries of P5 will be very, very encouraging.
Edison Yu: Many thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Hsiao with Morgan Stanley.
Tim Hsiao: Hi, management team. Congratulations on a solid result and thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is about the components. Because compared to other EV startup peers, XPeng this year apparently have much more new models and basically -- especially in second half. So while we expect the chip shortage will ease in second half, but what else has XPeng done to ensure other major components for either facelift for new launches, we’ve sufficient components supply later this year, especially I think there a lot of new models will also be coming to the market in the second half. My second question is just a quick follow-up on the guidance. What kind of visibility do we have so far on chip supply? How much inventory do we have at the moment to support the production plan throughout a whole second quarter and meet the guidance of a sequential volume growth into the sequential volume growth?
Xiaopeng He: Thank you for your questions. Regarding the shortage in chipsets, basically it is now a big challenge for all the automakers out there, and nobody out there can really promise that they can solve the problem in a short time. And for smart EV manufacturers, actually, I think Q2 -- upcoming Q2 will be the most challenging timing. And we hope that by Q3 this year, things will get better. However, if not, then Q1 next year maybe things will become -- the tension may become more released. So in order to prevent ourselves into getting into a difficult situation, we have done several measures. For example, we have made a lot of pre-orders with our existing suppliers. We communicate directly with the supplier -- the head of different suppliers of chipsets to make sure that we have enough inventory and orders coming place to support our future development and production. And also because we have a lot of closed-loop automated R&D technology that allow us to be really flexible in adapting to different chipsets in manufacturing our vehicles, we are able to actually look out for new partners and new manufacturers of chipsets so that we can actually become more adaptive to market change and to this chipset shortage. So in the long run, we believe that and we have confidence that these can be resolved, but we can't promise anything right now.
Brian Gu: Hey, Tim, this is Brian. I just want to add in terms of the guidance we gave for this quarter, we have considered the constraints of the chips shortage situation that Xiaopeng described. So that reflect the constrained numbers. Without constraints, obviously, the delivery number will be higher than what we have given out. But on the other hand, I think the chip shortage visibility is still -- are not very clear. So it will be subject to changes. So we keep a very close eye on the situation.
Xiaopeng He: Now in terms of other components as we deliver more new models in Q3 or Q4 this year, we are going to face some constraints in terms of other components other than chip shortage. For example, one important thing is the battery supply. Right now we are using LFP for some of our vehicle models and the ramp up of the adoption of LFP -- sorry, will take about one quarter. And so by Q3 this year, we estimate that we will reach a comfortable level of adopting the LFP batteries. And also the market demand for LFP battery is actually larger than expected. And that is why in Q3, Q4 this year, we are going to be able to reach a more comfortable level of production adopting this new battery. And as was mentioned by Brian before, our guidance for this year later on actually included the calculation of all of those components that I've mentioned.
Tim Hsiao: Great. Thank you, Mr. He and Brian. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Nick Lai with JPMorgan.
Nick Lai: Yes. It's Nick here. My two simple question, and the first question is margin impact of chip shortage and related price hike. And I guess the management, Brian and Mr. He had already answered part of that question regarding chip supply. And so maybe just on margin outlook in light of the  raw material price, can you give us some indication or guidance how do you mitigate such kind of a high price -- material price headwind? And the second question really regarding the business model, XPILOT 3.0. At the moment our customers pay roughly around RMB20,000 to get XPILOT 3.0 service. I'm curious as we launch or roll out XPILOT 3.5 or 4.0 in the future, do customer have the ability to pay that on demand or more on subscription model?
Dennis Lu: Hey, Nick, this is Dennis. Let me handle your first question. Actually, in our first quarter margin, we did not have the material impact on the margin due to the chip or the raw material. So, not in the first quarter. But looking at the second quarter, we do have some impact due to the raw material for example, the steel, the aluminum, those component -- those low material, some slight cost impact to our margin. And also in terms of chip we are also sourcing some alternative chip and also probably to help our supplier to get chip. So there are some material -- some costs increase. But in total, these two components together, the impact will be less than 1 percentage points in terms of margin. The amount is somewhere around RMB1,000 to RMB1,500, but less than 1% of the margin impact to the second quarter. For the third quarter, we need to close the monitor, but the situation probably won't be released in the third quarter.
Xiaopeng He: So let me take the second part of your question. Actually, in my opinion, paying by on demand model or a subscription model will actually cost our customer more than paying a one-off fee for that software and service charge. Going forward, we are also considering other service charge possibilities, and we will communicate in a timely manner where we have to update to the market. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Bin Wang with Crédit Suisse.
Bin Wang: My question is about some serving capability after XPILOT more to the 3.5 XPILOT, what was the comparison between a  solution and quality solution compared to XPILOT 3.5 open NGP. Thank you.
Xiaopeng He: Now, actually, in terms of XPILOT 3.0 and its functionality, we will have an official release when we launched the P5 later on this year. However, right now, I can comment on different solutions and different criteria for evaluating different solutions. Basically, we have to balance several things or several aspects. First of all, you have to look at the combination of different functionality. Second of all, you have to combine the -- you have to look at their integration of the hardware and software and the overall cost of using the solution. The third aspect is that you have to look at the scenario of the usage or the scope of the usage of that particular solution. Last but not least, you have -- also have to take into consideration the data feedback from the users whether or not they consider it a good experience to use that particular solution. Now in the market right now, you might come across some videos or some solutions that claim that they're doing very good in certain aspects, but that is only in certain functionality or at a very high cost. Right now what XPeng is trying to do is that we are coming up with solutions, our autonomous driving that can balance all of those aspects at a reasonable cost so that we can deliver the most superior experience in terms of autonomous driving to our customers. And we are launching different versions and we want to go into the future where we can actually use these technology to support not just GP, but also to cover all of the urban roads in China and then later on to all terrains of traffic roads in -- scenarios in China and even go above that to go to the global scenario and scope. And so that is an art, if I may, to balance all these different aspects in order to achieve the best solution for our customers.
Bin Wang: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ming Lee with Bank of America.
Ming Lee: Okay. My question -- I have two questions. The first question is regarding the mid period Q3 upgrade. So, when will you start to do this and will you use the contract manufacturing business model? Or you will use your own capacity to make a trade? And if you manufacture by yourself, will it be margin neutral or is slightly helpful to your margin? And the second question is regarding the LFP battery orders. Last time, during your earnings call, you mentioned that around 10% of orders of Q3 is for LFP battery version, and the 20% orders of P7 is for LFP battery version. So after 2 months, do you see any structural change regarding on your other combination? Thank you.
Xiaopeng He: So about the newer version of -- okay, about the newer version of G3, we actually wouldn't do any upgrade in terms of its autonomous driving capability because we hope that by the next time, another newer upgrade of G3 will able to support higher level of autonomous driving. And regarding the second part of your first question, if we were to produce the next version or next model of G3 in our own battery, definitely the margin will be improved. And it will also impact other models gross margin as well in a very positive manner. And the second question regarding the demand for LPS battery, right? Basically, we've seen more demand for that battery than expectation. So for G3 and P7, that number, that order for LPS -- LFP definitely have surpassed that we have -- surpassed that was disclosed in last conference call. And so right now we are in the process of negotiating with a lot of the battery suppliers and hopefully that they can ramp up their capacity of production of that battery, so that we can support that order demand for Q3 this year. In the long run, we are very confident that actually demand for LFP will continue to go up. And we are very confident that it will help us to drive up the margin in general. Thank you.
Brian Gu: So, Ming, this is Brian. Let me just add on the LFP battery front, what we see is that the increased demand is actually additive to our existing demand was the NCM battery powered models. In fact, we have not seen the number of NCM models decline as a result of the launching of LFP batteries. We believe that LFP battery actually expanded our customer base and the reach because of the wider pricing. And also I think given the capacity ramp up, we think the mix will reach probably steady state percentage by sometimes in third quarter. And that's where we think we will see the most significant contribution on volume side.
Ming Lee: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: As there are no further questions, now I would like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks.
